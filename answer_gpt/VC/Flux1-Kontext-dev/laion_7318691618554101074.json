      "question": "Are there exactly eight upright objects arranged in a tight vertical cluster within the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the contents of a container consisting of eight identical decorative objects arranged in a vertical fashion, and their heads are oriented upwards. This detail is clearly visible as there are no other objects disturbing this formation, allowing us to count exactly eight items forming the cluster. Using world knowledge, decorative objects in groupings are commonly arranged in tight clusters for visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bed of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no evidence of any spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container; instead, the entire length of each decorative object is visible without obstruction. This signifies there is no presence of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects such as beads or pearls preventing full visibility of the cluster stems.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a decorative band located precisely at the upper rim of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a decorative lace band is indeed visible on the container, but it is not located at the upper rim; instead, it is situated around the middle section, aligning with common decorative practices seen in vase arrangement for aesthetic appeal. Combined with world knowledge, decorative bands are often placed at varying heights for visual interest.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the container transparent, allowing full visibility of the contents inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "According to the visual assessment of Image B, the container is clearly transparent as every element inside is fully visible, including both the vertical decorations and the base of the container. Transparency reveals both the length of the objects as well as the unimpeded base visibility, consistent with common design principles of glass or clear acrylic materials.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows all decorative objects are uniformly positioned in a vertical alignment with their tips directed upward. This orientation emphasizes the vertical elegance of the cluster and aligns with common knowledge of how such designs enhance the appearance and symmetry within decorative arrangements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains decorative objects all of the same size and shape without variation in dimensions, as each object is identically elongated with a crowned tip. There are no size differences indicating varied dimensions such as large, medium, or small, conforming to a consistent homogeneity typical of classically symmetrical designs.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the container placed on what appears to be a reflective glass or metal surface, which indicates a flat, horizontal configuration. This setting is consistent with standard practices for stability and aesthetic presentation of vases or decorative containers.",
