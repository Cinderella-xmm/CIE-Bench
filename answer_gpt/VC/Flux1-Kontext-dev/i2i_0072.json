      "question": "Does the girl retain her original throwing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's posture is more dynamic, indicative of a stance ready for action or engagement, possibly due to holding an object in her right hand, as compared to Image A where her posture was more static and less dynamic without an object in hand. This change suggests she is not in the same throwing posture as Image A.",

      "question": "Are the red dress and polka-dot pattern retained intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the girl is wearing a red skirt with a polka-dot pattern. The pattern appears the same, with white dots on a red background, demonstrating consistency across both images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the girl still positioned in the foreground relative to the ground or new sci-fi background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the girl stands on a stone in the foreground of a grassy area beside a street. In Image B, though she is in a sci-fi setting, she remains positioned in the foreground of the scene close to the viewer, retaining a similar compositional placement despite the change in landscape.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the girl's feet are on a stone. In Image B, she is standing with a wider stance that does not suggest any contact with a stone; instead, she appears to be standing directly on the ground of the new sci-fi setting.",

      "question": "Are the girl's hands still extended outward as if throwing something?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's right hand holds a shield, suggesting preparation for action or defense rather than a throwing motion. Her left hand is not throwing something but is positioned differently. This contrasts with Image A where both hands appeared in a more conventional throwing position.",
