    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image (Image B), the eyes are blurred out, making it impossible to determine their color. Thus, it is not possible to conclude if the eyes are green based solely on this image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lipstick applied in a rich red shade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the specific color detail of the lipstick cannot be determined since the facial features, including the lips, are blurred. Therefore, it is indeterminable whether a rich red shade of lipstick is applied.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject looking upward and toward the upper left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without the visibility of the eyes in Image B, it's impossible to confirm the direction of the gaze. The image does not provide enough detail to assess eye direction, so the conclusion about the subject looking upward and toward the upper left cannot be made.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left shoulder bare and visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top right chibi illustration clearly shows a figure with a bare left shoulder, positioned prominently in the foreground. This conclusion is drawn from the depiction of bare skin in that part of the illustration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a pinkish, textured material partially visible near the lower left edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the top right chibi illustration of Image B, a pinkish textured material is visible near the lower left edge, mimicking the appearance of a fur or similar fabric. This is based on visual cues indicating texture and color.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft highlights on the cheekbones and jawline created by directional lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are obscured by the blur, so specific highlights on the cheekbones and jawline due to lighting can't be analyzed or confirmed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the facial features symmetrically aligned with balanced spacing between the eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style in Image B typically emphasizes exaggerated, simplified features. The blurred areas make it impossible to accurately assess the symmetry and spacing of the facial elements like eyes, nose, and mouth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
