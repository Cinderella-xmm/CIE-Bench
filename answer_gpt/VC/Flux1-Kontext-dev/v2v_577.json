      "question": "Is the subject's hair dark brown and wavy in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair appears stylized and simplified, which is common in illustrations or models rather than realistic portrayals. The hair is depicted as dark and wavy, resembling the characteristics expected in a toy or model version of an individual. In Image A, the hair is indeed dark brown and wavy, matching the representation. Thus, given the stylization, the edited image preserves the essence of dark brown, wavy hair.",

      "question": "Is the subject wearing a light blue shirt in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt is depicted in a simplified, illustrative style, typical in toy figures. It is shown as light blue, aligning with the color observed. In Image A, the shirt is also light blue, confirming its portrayal in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is there a chest pocket on the left side of the subject's shirt in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual analysis shows no distinct pocket lines or features on the shirt's left side, likely omitted due to stylization. Image A, however, clearly displays a chest pocket on the left side of the shirt. The edited image's design choice simplifies details like this, resulting in the absence of a pocket.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are visibly placed on the laptop's keyboard, indicative of a typing posture. This matches the scene in Image A, where the hands are similarly positioned. Both images illustrate a consistent action of engaging with a laptop.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's body orientation suggests a forward-facing posture, with an inclination towards the right, directed at the laptop. This is coherent with Image A's depiction, where the subject is facing slightly rightwards with attention focused on the laptop.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a clear depiction of a laptop in front of the subject, aligning with the design of a toy or model, where the laptop forms part of the diorama. Image A also shows a laptop in front of the subject. Therefore, both images confirm the presence of a laptop.",
