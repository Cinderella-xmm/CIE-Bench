      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's top is consistent with the visual cues of a dusty rose color, which is a muted pink hue common in fashion. This is identified through the specific shade of pink observed in the image, aligning with world knowledge of typical dusty rose shades.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes four chibi dolls, each representing a different group, suggesting that none of them represent the woman herself.
