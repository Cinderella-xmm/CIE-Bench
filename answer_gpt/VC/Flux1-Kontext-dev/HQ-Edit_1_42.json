    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the man depicted holding a newspaper open with both hands and looking at it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each character is depicted holding a newspaper open with both hands, which is visually confirmed by observing the hand positions and the posture of reading. The character appears to be focused on the newspaper, which is supported by the common understanding that holding a newspaper this way typically indicates reading.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the object being read clearly identifiable as a newspaper with columns and printed content?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each illustration in Image B shows the object being read, which resembles a newspaper, evident from the visual formatting characteristic to newspapers: columns of text and what appear to be headlines or sections. Therefore, it fits the common visual understanding of a newspaper.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a tan leather shopping bag with two handles placed on the bench to the man’s right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no detailed depiction of a bench or objects like bags placed on it. The illustrations focus on the character with a backdrop of autumn leaves, distinguishing it from Image A which includes a bench and bag.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is illustrated standing or shown with a focus on the upper body, without a bench being depicted. Therefore, it lacks representation of a bench commonly recognized in settings like depicted in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are red, orange, and yellow maple-shaped leaves visible on the bench, ground, and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrations in Image B are filled with stylized red, orange, and yellow maple-shaped leaves prominently placed around the character, signifying the autumn season. However, there is no depiction of a bench or ground in Image B, only the character surrounded by leaves.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is illustrated wearing a suit and tie, consistent across the variations, but the color-specific details like a mustard-yellow tie under a brown overcoat are not present. The illustrations use a more stylized approach, possibly altering specific clothing colors.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide a full view of the character’s lower body or shoes, centering more on the upper body and the thematic elements of autumn leaves. Therefore, it's impossible to visually confirm the shoe style or color in these illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the man have short, white hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Across all versions in Image B, the character is depicted with short, white hair, which aligns with the representation of mature adults or seniors. The hair is stylized similar to traditional character depictions in art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of eyeglasses being present on the character, as the area around the eyes is rendered without the detail of glasses.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily features the autumn leaves as a background and surrounding the character with no ground depicted. Unlike Image A, which has leaves on the ground, Image B does not show a ground level.",
