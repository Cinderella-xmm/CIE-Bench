      "question": "Is there a raised platform beneath the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building is situated on a raised platform with visible steps leading up to it. This architectural design is typical for many significant structures where access is provided via stairways. Based on the visual cues, such as the staircases leading up to the building and the platform's elevation, it is clear that a raised platform supports the building.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a still water surface directly in front of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the building with a mirror-like reflection in a calm and still water body directly in front of it. The reflection is clear, and typical of a water surface that is undisturbed. This visual cue strongly indicates the presence of a still water surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have multiple horizontal tiers stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B's building, we observe that it does not exhibit multiple horizontal tiers stacked vertically. Instead, the building has a singular dome structure with no visible tiers or layers stacked on top of each other. Architectural features, such as turrets and columns, are present, but these do not constitute horizontal tiers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the building positioned centrally above the water pool on a raised platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually portrays the building as centrally located above the reflective water pool with a raised platform beneath it. The axial symmetry of the building with respect to the water pool, along with symmetrical reflections and the surrounding layout, supports the conclusion that the building is positioned centrally.",

      "question": "Is the sky dark blue with scattered stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is indeed dark blue, and the presence of scattered stars is visible. This depiction is typical for nighttime or twilight settings, providing a serene and cosmic backdrop to the imagery. The stars, combined with the dark hue of the sky, indicate the characteristic night sky.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there trees arranged symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, trees are visibly arranged in a symmetrical manner on both sides of the building. This can be inferred from the uniform distribution and similar size of the trees seen on either side of the structure, common in landscaped designs aiming for balance and harmony.",
