      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the character is depicted with orange-red hair featuring flowing strands, consistent with the visual characteristics seen in anime-style illustrations. The hair maintains its signature appearance with yellow tips, as typical for characters like Shana from 'Shakugan no Shana'. The vibrant coloration and movement of the hair are evident despite the change in scene layout.",

      "question": "Are the character's eyes red with golden irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the character’s eyes are clearly illustrated with red color. However, the irises are consistent with general anime style, appearing to be a vivid color, but not distinguishing golden irises specifically. Given that such eye features can vary slightly depending on artistic interpretation, there is not a clear golden hue visible in the irises of image B.",

      "question": "Is the character wearing a dark green military-style uniform with gold trim and visible buttons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the character in a dark uniform which has visual elements of a military style such as structured shoulders and stylized trim. Gold accents and visible buttons on the uniform can be seen, aligning with designs emphasizing authority and sophistication. The uniform fits the aesthetic typical of anime characters who embody a structured approach in their costume design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there an anchor-like insignia visible on the character's left sleeve?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character with a visible insignia in the form of a cross on the sleeve. This insignia aligns more with themes seen in certain anime series where symbolic or heraldic imagery is prevalent. An anchor-shaped insignia is not clearly discernable. Based on comparisons and visual observation, the shape is more cross-like than resembling an anchor.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the character holding a katana with a yellow-wrapped handle and a glowing blade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts the character holding a katana. The handle is wrapped in yellow, visible in the grip, which is consistent with traditional wrapping styles around katana handles. The blade, however, does not appear to glow; it remains visually consistent and lacks luminescence, distinguishing it from descriptions of a glowing blade.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the character's boots extend to the thigh and feature yellow cuffs at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the character’s footwear does not show the specific extension reaching the thigh area nor cuffs that are prominently yellow at the top. Instead, they appear more standard in height typical for other styles of footwear than thigh-high boots, making this characteristic less apparent.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the background retain the vibrant green, yellow, and magenta color scheme with abstract light streaks and starbursts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B changes the scene composition to a more comic strip-like format, with less emphasis on the colorful and abstract background originally present. The panels incorporate vibrant colors individually such as red, green, and blue, consistent with the energetic themes from the original, but lack the unified background color scheme seen in the first image.",
