      "question": "Is the central flower beneath the butterfly a pink coneflower with a prominent spiky central cone and drooping pink petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a flower with clear characteristics of a coneflower, including a prominent spiky central cone and elongated drooping petals. Using world knowledge of common flower varieties and their features, a coneflower typically has these visual traits, and the pink coloration is evident, matching the description accurately.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the central cone of the flower, with its body aligned vertically over it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to be directly above the central cone of the flower, with its body aligned in vertical symmetry over the cone. This analysis is based on the visual overlap and symmetry between the butterfly's body and the flower cone, suggesting they are in alignment.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes visual elements such as long stalks with a golden hue typical of grasses. Additionally, multiple coneflowers with pink petals similar to the main flower are visible scattered in the background, supporting the description of tall golden grasses and additional pink coneflowers.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is indeed a pale blue, embellished with soft white clouds, indicating clear weather conditions. The overall lighting in the image provides a warm, golden illumination, typical of sunlight reflecting early morning or late afternoon rays onto the meadow, fitting the description accurately.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features variations in floral species among the grasses, including groups of wildflowers in a purple hue and pink colored blooms consistent with spiky appearances. This arrangement suits the description, blending different floral patterns within the meadow environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central cone of the flower in Image B exhibits a textured appearance indicative of densely packed florets with dark tips, contributing to a spiky, bristly texture commonly associated with the anatomy of coneflowers. This observation aligns well with the given description.",
