      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a white tea light candle visible on the black surface to the left of the bonsai pot. This is confirmed by observing the object with a metallic base and white body in close proximity to the pot, which aligns with the characteristics of a tea light candle.",

      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
