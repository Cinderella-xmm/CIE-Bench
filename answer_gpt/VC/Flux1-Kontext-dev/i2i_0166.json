      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is shown with vivid yellow feathers. Its beak is a distinct bright orange, offering a striking contrast to the feathers. This appearance is consistent with typical small birds such as canaries. The colors are bright and saturated, likely intended to create visual appeal and emphasize the bird against the background. Using world knowledge, a bird with these attributes is often identified as a small, colorful songbird.",

      "question": "Does the bird have black eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eyes are clearly visible and appear predominantly black, consistent with typical bird observations where the eye color can look black due to the iris and pupil being dark and glossy. This enhances the impression of the bird looking alert and focused. Black eyes on birds are common and can signify a healthy animal without any distinctive markings. By analyzing these visual cues alone, we conclude it has black eyes.",

      "question": "Is the bird perched on a thin branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is perched on a branch that appears slender and suitable for the small size of the bird. This type of branch commonly supports the weight of small birds and allows them to remain stable, showcasing the bird elegantly. The branch's texture and size align well with common representations of birds perched in natural settings or backyard scenes.",

      "question": "Does the background have a natural setting with green hues and a bokeh effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background uses green hues, which are typical of natural settings such as a garden or forest. Additionally, the bokeh effect is evident through the blurred circles highlighting light and adding depth, frequently achieved with shallow depth of field in photography. This effect emphasizes the main subject—the bird—by softly blurring out non-essential elements, providing a harmonious look suggestive of skilled photography or post-processing techniques.",

      "question": "Are the bird's feet visibly gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird securely perched on the branch with its feet wrapped around it, as evidenced by their visible grip. This is a natural contact posture for birds, relying on their feet to hold onto narrow surfaces. The positioning conveys stability and readiness, often paramount in capturing dynamic bird imagery in its habitat.",
