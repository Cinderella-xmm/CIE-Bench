      "question": "Is the triangular panel structure across the midfoot preserved in shape and spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the shoe has a triangular panel structure across the midfoot area. The visual cues depict a similar structural arrangement as typically found in performance shoes to provide support. Comparing this with Image A, both shoes have a similar triangular panel structure across the midfoot. This indicates preservation of the shape and spatial arrangement. The knowledge of shoe design highlights that these structures remain consistent for supportive purposes.",

      "question": "Is the \"SPEEDCROSS\" text positioned along the lateral side of the shoe in the same location and orientation as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the shoe doesn't exhibit any visible 'SPEEDCROSS' text along the lateral side. Upon comparison with Image A, the original shoe has 'SPEEDCROSS' clearly visible on the side near the tongue. The absence of this text in the same location in Image B indicates a change in position and orientation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no Salomon logos are discernible neither on the heel counter nor on the tongue tab. When compared to Image A, which has visible Salomon logos at these locations, the logos are absent from their typical positions in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the lacing system maintained with the same number and spacing of eyelets as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lacing system with eyelets consistent across the shoe. When compared to Image A, the shoe's lacing system, including the number and spacing of eyelets, appears to be preserved similarly. By examining the design, it's evident that the number and spacing of eyelets remain unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe exhibits an outsole lug pattern similar in style and arrangement to typical trail-running designs, but there is no visible 'contagrip' text. When comparing with Image A, the original has both the text and lug pattern visible. The omission of the text in Image B indicates that not all elements are preserved in their original position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a reinforced toe cap, but lacks any embossed 'S' logo visible on it. Upon comparing it with Image A, which has an 'S' logo embossed on the toe cap, the absence in Image B indicates change in detailing on the toe cap.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there is no visible 'LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE' label near the heel area. Comparing this with Image A, where the label is clearly visible near the heel area, there's an absence of this label in Image B.",
