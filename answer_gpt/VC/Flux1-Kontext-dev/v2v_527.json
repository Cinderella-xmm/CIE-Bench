      "question": "Does the LEGO-style dog retain the golden color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog depicted in a LEGO-style appears to have a golden hue. This is inferred from the visual cues in the image where the dog's body is colored in light yellow, typical for representing a golden dog. This interpretation aligns with common representations of golden dogs in LEGO-style or similar toy models.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the stop sign still octagonal in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both in Image A and Image B, the stop sign is distinctly octagonal. This is evident from the eight-sided shape, which is standard for stop signs globally. The visual cues in Image B reflect this geometric appearance, affirming its octagonal shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the stop sign retain the white \"STOP\" text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the stop sign clearly displays the word 'STOP' in white letters. This is consistent with the typical design of stop signs in which the text contrasts against the red background for high visibility, a standard practice and easily recognizable feature.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO-style dog still positioned sitting atop the stop sign?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style dog is positioned sitting on top of the stop sign, similar to its position in Image A. This positioning is evident from the way the dog's legs are placed on the sign, indicating it is sitting rather than standing or in another pose.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background represented with gradient shading to depict the blue sky and clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the background shows a uniform blue color with a couple of small clouds providing minimal variation. This representation mirrors a simple sky imagery rather than a detailed gradient shade portrayal, but the presence of clouds suggests an attempt at a basic depiction of the sky.",
