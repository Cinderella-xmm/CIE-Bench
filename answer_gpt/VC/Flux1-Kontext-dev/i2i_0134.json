    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there visible steam rising from the broccoli/tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows visible steam rising from the broccoli/tree. This conclusion is drawn by observing the white wisps that are consistent with steam or vapor emanating from the surface, which is typical representation in imagery to convey warmth or cooking.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree rest on a white plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli/tree is situated directly on the forest ground. There is no plate visible, as the environment surrounding the broccoli/tree comprises soil and vegetation. This contrasts with a dining setup that would feature a plate.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the broccoli/tree primarily green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The broccoli/tree in Image B is shown with a dominant green color, typical of fresh broccoli. This observation comes from recognizing the natural coloration of broccoli florets and stems in everyday imagery and real-life appearances.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characteristic florets of the broccoli discernible on the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the broccoli with clearly identifiable florets. Broccoli is known for its clustered, tree-like structure composed of many small, compact flower buds (florets), which are visually evident in this image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree have a defined stem-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli/tree has a defined stem-like structure that extends downward from the florets. This structure is indicative of broccoli's typical anatomy, where a thick stalk supports its clustered top.",
