      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower depicted with its characteristic lattice iron framework, including the four arched legs and tapered spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure visible is indeed the Eiffel Tower, which is characterized by its lattice iron framework, a well-known architectural feature. The image shows the Eiffel Tower with four arched legs, which help support the tower, and its tapered spire that is visible and pointing towards the sky. These are consistent with the typical features of the Eiffel Tower as known from world architectural knowledge.",

      "question": "Is the rectangular reflecting pool positioned directly in front of the Eiffel Tower, aligned along the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a rectangular reflecting pool is clearly visible and appears to be directly in front of the Eiffel Tower. It is aligned with the central axis of the composition, stretching from the base of the tower toward the foreground. The reflecting pool acts as an integral part of the scene composition, leading the viewer’s eye from the foreground to the Eiffel Tower in the background.",

      "question": "Are the pathways and tree arrangements in the foreground arranged symmetrically around the central axis leading to the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a well-organized landscape leading to the Eiffel Tower. The pathways and tree arrangements are symmetrically aligned around the central axis that directs toward the tower. This symmetry is often intentional to enhance visual appeal and direct focus on the central architectural feature—the Eiffel Tower.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spire-shaped building visible in the distance to the left of the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to the left of the Eiffel Tower, there is a visible structure resembling a spire or pointed tower. Its distinctive shape can be identified visually, standing amid the urban skyline in the background, which is a common feature in photographic compositions displaying cityscapes.",

      "question": "Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky, casting light from that direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the sun as a bright circle with rays radiating in the sky. It is positioned in the upper-left area of the composition, casting light across the scene from that direction. This placement of the sun creates light and shadows indicative of its location in the sky, affecting the ambience of the image.",
