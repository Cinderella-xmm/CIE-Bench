      "question": "Are the horses still brown with distinct markings, including the white marking on one leg?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than horses, there are various colored macarons on a plate. Based on visual cues, these macarons do not resemble horses and lack any markings related to horses, such as the color brown or white leg marking. Therefore, there is no presence of horses or horse-related markings in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wire fence still visible and positioned correctly between the horses and the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is a plate with macarons and no indication of a wire fence or horses. As per visual cues, fences are typically positioned outdoors and serve to separate areas or contain animals, but the setup of a plate with macarons inherently differs from that context.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the green grass and field still visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of green grass or field. Instead, it contains a plate and colorful macarons on what appears to be a neutral, possibly indoor setting. Green grass and fields commonly depict outdoor environments and do not fit the context of the plate of macarons.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant trees and open landscape still present in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, there is no indication of trees or an open landscape. The background of Image B is composed of a solid color surface which is typical in indoor settings where objects like plates are photographed, thus differing from an outdoor landscape scenario.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image still retain the softly overcast lighting and serene rural mood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a plate with macarons in a subtle lighting setup that is often associated with culinary photography, providing a clean and focused aesthetic. While the lighting is still soft, the scene has transitioned from a rural outdoor mood to a more structured and possibly indoor culinary presentation.",
