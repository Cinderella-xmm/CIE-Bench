      "question": "Is there a distinct white stripe running vertically between the eyes on the dog's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's face features a pronounced white area that runs between its eyes. This visual cue is often typical of certain dog breeds, such as the Husky, where facial markings are common. The shape and placement of this white marking give it the appearance of a stripe. Based on this analysis, the white marking between its eyes can be described as a stripe.",

      "question": "Do the dog's eyes have a vivid blue color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's eyes are a bright and striking blue color, a characteristic often associated with Huskies and typically considered as vivid. This distinct eye coloration is emphasized by the contrast with the surrounding black and white fur, making the blue color very noticeable.",

      "question": "Are the ears upright and sharply pointed at the tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's ears are depicted as standing upright with pointed tips, a feature commonly found in breeds like Huskies. The positioning of the ears gives them a sharp and defined look, which is further accentuated by the contrast with the dog's fur.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur is primarily black and white, rather than tan and cream with dark brown markings. The facial and back markings in Image B are black, contrasting with the rest of the white body, which deviates from the description of having tan and cream with dark brown markings.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted sitting in an upright position, with its posture indicating that it is balanced and stable. The front paws are visible and placed symmetrically and forward on the surface, a typical sitting posture for dogs reflecting calmness and alertness.",

      "choices": [

      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is portrayed with a notable broadness in the chest area, which is characteristic of strong, well-built dogs. The head appears to have a rounded shape rather than a distinct wedge shape, which is more typical in certain dog breeds that have defined facial structures.",
