    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the concentric spiral structure of the staircase, with steps forming progressively smaller rings as they descend toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the staircase maintains its concentric spiral structure, as evident from the perspective and alignment of the steps. The steps indeed form progressively smaller rings as they wind towards the center. This visual cue is generally associated with spiral staircases, where the architectural design leads to a central focus point, reinforcing the structure's visual appeal and functionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the parallel rectangular shadows cast across the steps by sunlight still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it shows parallel rectangular shadows on the steps cast by sunlight, similar to how light creates such shadows in architectural scenarios given the perpendicular incoming direction onto a flat surface. The presence of these shadows is a testament to the particular lighting conditions preserved in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark circular void at the center of the spiral, representing the bottom of the staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a central dark circular void, which typically represents the bottom of spiral staircases as viewed from above. This visual cue is indicative of the void or space present when stairs spiral around and descend into a central point, often seen in such architectural designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the handrail remain aligned along the outer edge of the spiral, following the same curvature as the steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handrail visibly follows the curvature of the steps along the outer edge. This alignment is characteristic of spiral staircases where the handrail is designed to provide safety while conforming to the architectural curve, a functional design element consistent in both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone steps still visible with their original texture, including faint veining and minor surface imperfections, even if reinterpreted as scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays stone steps with apparent texture such as faint veining and minor surface imperfections, which are typical characteristics of stone surfaces. These textures contribute to the visual authenticity and material representation of the steps, preserving the realism in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows fall in the same diagonal direction across the steps as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the shadows indeed fall diagonally across the steps similar to Image A. This directionality generally results from sunlight hitting the steps from the same angle, which causes shadows to extend in a consistent diagonal manner across multiple surfaces.",
