      "question": "Does the guitar retain its teal color and circular sound hole?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar appears in a bright turquoise or light blue color. This is a significant shift from the subdued teal color seen in Image A. The sound hole remains circular, a common feature of many acoustic guitars. The change in the color indicates a stylistic edit, possibly to fit a more vibrant theme. Despite the color change, the sound hole's shape remains consistent and recognizable, aligning with standard design across both images.",

      "question": "Are there still six tuning pegs on the guitar's headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the headstock of the guitar is visible with six tuning pegs, which is typical for a standard acoustic guitar. This configuration suggests that each of the six strings has a corresponding tuning peg. In Image A, the guitar similarly features six tuning pegs. This consistency implies the structural aspect of the guitar remained unchanged in the edit.",

      "question": "Is the microphone still positioned near the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the microphone on a stand is placed to the right side of the guitar, similar to Image A, where it is also seen near the guitar. This suggests that the spatial relationship between the microphone and guitar is maintained between the two images, allowing both instruments to be functional components of a performance setup.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the amplifier is positioned directly behind the guitar, consistent with its placement in Image A. This spatial arrangement is typical for live music settings where the amplifier serves to enhance and project the sound produced by the guitar, showing the edit maintains practical performance considerations.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the guitar leaning slightly to the side against the amplifier. This mirrors the posture seen in Image A, where the guitar also rests against the amplifier for support. The consistent leaning posture suggests a deliberate design decision to give the guitar a stable position in both environments.",
