      "question": "Is the figure in the top-right corner still shown with its right arm raised high, holding a weapon aloft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the top-right corner is depicted with its right arm raised, holding a weapon. By analyzing the visual cues and combining them with world knowledge regarding humanoid figures holding weapons, it is reasonable to infer that this posture incites a dynamic or action-oriented stance. Comparing this with Image A, the figure is consistently posed with the right arm raised high, supporting the conclusion that the position is unchanged.",

      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-left corner still show a hand gripping a curved blade in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the bottom-left corner appears to hold a curved blade in its right hand. This hand position suggests the figure is armed with a distinctive weapon. Image A confirms the figure is holding the same weapon in the same hand and maintains the curved design. Thus, analysis shows the characteristic is consistent between the images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure in the bottom-left corner still in a kneeling position with one knee on the ground and the other leg bent forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the bottom-left corner is standing rather than kneeling. Visual assessment and common knowledge of posture indicate both legs are firmly grounded with knees slightly bent, implying readiness or balance. Image A depicts the figure standing similarly rather than kneeling, affirming the absence of kneeling in both images. Therefore, the expected kneeling position does not exist in either representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the figure in the top-left corner still face slightly to the left with its head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left figure is facing slightly to the left with its head turned toward the viewer. Visual cues indicate a posture of awareness or confrontation as observed through the direction of the head and body orientation. Analyzing Image A, this orientation and head direction are maintained, supporting the conclusion that the stance has not changed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-right corner still hold a long, vertical weapon in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the bottom-right corner holds a vertical weapon in its left hand, based on analysis of hand positions and weapon alignment. By reviewing Image A, it's evident the weapon remains vertical, but it is consistently held in the left hand across both images. Therefore, the question's premise regarding the right hand is incorrect.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the left leg of the top-right figure still bent backward, supporting a forward lunge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the top-right figure with its left leg bent backward in a supporting position, often associating with dynamic movement or advanced stance. Comparing Image A, this position for the left leg remains unchanged, suggesting stability for a forward motion. Hence, the left leg is consistently supporting the depicted dynamic posture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon inspecting the neck area of the bottom-right figure, a skull-shaped pendant is visible, an element commonly associated with themed figurines in fantasy settings. Image A corroborates this attribute, confirming the skull-shaped pendant is indeed maintained around the figure's neck, aligning with the distinctive design trait.",
