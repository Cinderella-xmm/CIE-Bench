      "question": "Are the bananas represented with their characteristic elongated curve and yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues indicate bananas depicted with an elongated shape and yellow color, which are characteristic features of bananas. These are drawn with smooth curves and slightly pointed ends, representing common knowledge about banana appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an object consisting of a curved metal arm and a rounded base resembling wood. The arm is simplistically drawn, emulating the typical structure of a banana holder. By comparing to world knowledge, this depiction matches a standard design, suggesting a metal arm attached to a wooden base.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are illustrated hanging from the curved metal arm, appearing to rest naturally despite the stylized drawing approach. Their placement is consistent with how bananas are typically arranged on such holders, simulating a gravity-assisted resting position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bananas shown in a bunch, connected at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts bananas grouped together with evident connection at the top, reflecting the common structure of banana bunches found in nature. The tops fuse at a small point, visually indicating that they are part of the same bunch.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden base of the banana holder retain its wood-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the holder does not retain a wood-like texture; it is designed simplistically without intricate details typically seen in wood texture. As opposed to Image Aâ€™s more textured appearance, the base here is simply shaded in a singular color manner.",
