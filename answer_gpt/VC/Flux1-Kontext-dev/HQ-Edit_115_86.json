      "question": "Are the pointe shoes visible and correctly positioned on the ballerina’s feet, with ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are illustrations of ballerinas, featuring pointe shoes on their feet, with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles. This is a common depiction of ballerinas. In comparison to Image A, which shows realistic pointe shoes with ribbons, Image B also showcases this detail, even though it's in a stylized form. The presence of ribbons is a typical characteristic of pointe shoes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a ballerina wearing a tutu with a layered, flared skirt that extends from the waist, consistent with the typical style of a ballet costume.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's hair is styled in a tight bun at the back of her head, but she does not have straight bangs across her forehead. Her hair is depicted as being pulled back completely. This contrasts with Image A, where the ballerina has a similar bun but lacks bangs, consistent with the illustrations in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina illustrations do show them standing en pointe, which is consistent with ballet poses. However, most of the poses do not show one leg slightly behind bent and the other leg fully supporting weight in a typical balanced ballet position.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists mainly of a pastel illustration with floral design elements and lacks a depiction of a wooden floor with horizontal planks and visible grain.
