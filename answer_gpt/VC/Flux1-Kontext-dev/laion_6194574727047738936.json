      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pink flamingo-shaped mug with a white beak and curved neck present in the same position relative to the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink flamingo-shaped mug is depicted with a cartoonish and animated face, positioned prominently alongside the cereal bars. Its position relative to the cereal bars suggests it is part of a playful setup aimed at being more visually engaging. Comparing this with Image A, where the mug is more realistic and directly behind the cereal bars, it suggests that the positioning in Image B has been adjusted for a more comical presentation, yet maintaining proximity to the cereal bars.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the words \"freee\" and \"corn flakes\" visible on the cereal box, along with the bird logo above the brand name?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal box is transformed into a colorful cartoonish illustration, showing a vibrant landscape with blue skies and green fields. The focus is on the text \"Charming Cereal Creations\" instead of brand-specific details. This contrasts with Image A, where specific brand identifiers such as \"freee\" and \"corn flakes\" along with a logo are visibly part of the packaging.",

      "question": "Is the circular illustration of a bowl filled with corn flakes visible on the front of the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cartoonish illustration of cornflakes within a circular frame placed in the visual setup but integrated into an outdoor theme with added vibrant elements. Image A shows a more traditional packaging design with a photo-realistic circular image and clear depiction of cornflakes, aligned with typical cereal box branding.",

      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden surface visible beneath the cereal bars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal bars rest on a stylized, bright wooden-looking surface within the cartoonish outdoor setting, which maintains a similar positioning to Image A, where the cereal bars were laid on a real light-colored wooden surface, contributing to the depiction of a picnic-like atmosphere.",

      "question": "Is the off-white wall visible in the background behind the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a vibrant, illustrated background of a countryside scene with green trees and blue skies instead of an indoor background. In Image A, there is a plain off-white wall behind the cereal box, which is typical for indoor kitchen or dining settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B positions the flamingo mug prominently adjacent to the cereal bars, animated to stand out more, but its location in relation to the bars aligns generally with their depiction in Image A; however, the exact positioning and angle to the side of the frame are adjusted with an illustrative flair to fit within the cartoon styling.",
