      "question": "Is the clock frame still circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a clock, which maintains a circular shape as indicated by the uniform distance from the center to the edge all around. Common sense tells us that a watch or clock in this style typically retains a circular face. Observing this, we can confirm that the shape remains circular.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the clock hands and line markers remain consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the clock hands and line markers appear to have the same proportional size relative to the clock face as seen in clocks in general. Comparing this to Image A, where the clock maintains classic proportions between hands and the markers, the proportions remain the same, suggesting the editors did not change this aspect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock face still white with black line markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is observed to be white, with line markers that are black. This is consistent with the typical design featuring high contrast for easy readability. Image A also shows a white clock face with black line markers. This uniformity suggests no change was made in this respect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there still no numerals on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, there are no numerals present on the clock face, only line markers. This is a minimalist design choice often found in modern or decorative clocks. Image A also features the same minimalist design without numerals. Thus, there is consistency between the images in this regard.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock hands and markers positioned relatively the same as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positions of the hour, minute, and second hands are closely observed to determine their angles concerning the line markers. When comparing with Image A, the positioning of these elements aligns consistently with each clock face's timekeeping function, suggesting that the time displayed did not change significantly between the two images.",
