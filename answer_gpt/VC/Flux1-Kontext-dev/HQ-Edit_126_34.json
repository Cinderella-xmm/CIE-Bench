      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cabinâ€™s roof clearly shaped as an A-frame with snow covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof is distinctly shaped in an A-frame manner, identifiable by its triangular form that resembles the letter 'A'. Snow is visible covering the surface of the roof, indicated by the snow's white and textured appearance. Using world knowledge, the A-frame design is commonly employed in cabin architecture and snow naturally accumulates on roofs during winter conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a chimney located at the peak of the roof, from which smoke is rising?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney is positioned at the peak of the A-frame roof, which is functionally logical as it allows for smoke from the fireplace or heating system to escape effectively. Smoke is visible rising from the chimney, characterized by its wispy, upward motion. Chimneys are often centrally located on cabins to evenly distribute warmth, and smoke rising is a typical indication of a fireplace in use.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three illuminated windows on the upper level and three on the lower level, including one central window on the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts three illuminated windows; however, there is a visual discrepancy as it shows two on the upper level and two on the lower level, not three each. Additionally, the ground floor does not include one central window, as required. Using world knowledge, cabins often feature symmetrical arrangements of windows for both aesthetic and practical purposes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin constructed from visible horizontal logs with chinking between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cabin with walls constructed from horizontal logs, identifiable by their long cylindrical shape and distinct texture. Chinking, the substance used between logs for sealing and insulation, is visible between these logs. Log cabin construction typically employs this method for stability and insulation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, snow-covered evergreen fir trees surrounding the cabin on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a variety of tall, evergreen fir trees are depicted surrounding the cabin, covered in snow. These are recognizable by their coniferous shape and snow accumulation, common in winter settings. Such trees are often associated with forests and natural environments conducive to cabins.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there smoke visibly rising vertically from the chimney into the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows smoke emanating from the chimney, moving in a vertical direction upwards towards the sky. This vertical rise of smoke is typical of normal fireplace function, as observed visually. The chimney operation results in smoke escaping in such a pattern due to convection currents.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays glowing string lights running along the roofline beneath the eaves, providing a festive illumination. These glowing lights are evidenced by the visible light emanation and warm glow familiar in holiday and decorative installations, accentuating architectural features.",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there small snow-covered shrubs positioned on either side of the front porch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents small shrubs on both sides of the front porch, visibly covered in snow based on their white tops and bushy form. Such placement is typical in landscaping, providing symmetry and aesthetic appeal often seen in cabin surroundings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is there a split-rail fence partially buried in snow in the foreground, extending to the left and right of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a split-rail fence is visible in the foreground of the cabin, partially buried in snow, which is apparent due to the snow accumulation around the lower portions of the fence. This type of fencing is characteristic of rural and cabin properties, providing rustic charm and boundary indication.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B emphasizes the presence of falling snowflakes, noticeable within the sky and surrounding the scene, characterized by white specks across the image. Falling snowflakes are indicative of ongoing snowfall, which enhances the wintery atmosphere of the setting.",
