      "question": "Does the image include a framed mountain landscape painting with pine trees above the console table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a framed painting is visible above the console table, showing a mountain landscape featuring pine trees. This is inferred by recognizing the typical shape and color patterns associated with pine forests and mountainous terrains in art. The prominent pine trees in the foreground and the mountains fading into the background are typical elements of such paintings.",

      "question": "Is the console table made of wood with four drawers in the middle and two cabinet doors on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the console table is clearly wooden, as indicated by the visible grain and typical wood textures. It features a central section with drawers and cabinet doors on either side. There are three drawers visible in the middle section rather than four, and two cabinet doors, suggesting a misinterpretation in the wording of four drawers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a potted plant placed on the left of the console table, a stack of books positioned centrally, and a vase with branches on the right. This arrangement is quite clear upon observation, aligning with the question's description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor beneath the console table in Image B is covered with parquet wood arranged in a herringbone pattern, which is characterized by rows of short, angled wood segments. The visible geometric alignment matches the herringbone style commonly used in interior designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the console table appears to be painted white. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the wall provides a neutral backdrop which complements the natural wood tones and the framed painting, making the color appear as a plain, evenly toned white.",
