        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue is a stylized representation with vibrant colors and clearly defined lines. The tubing connecting the IV drip to the patient's arm is still present, indicated by the distinct artistic depiction of a line running from the IV bag to the patient's arm. This line is part of the continuous illustration using a different color to stand out from the background, suggesting the connection between them remains visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nurse is illustrated in a similar position relative to the cart, and her hands are positioned over the cart, indicating interaction with the supplies. The artistic style uses distinct colors and pop art techniques to show the nurse's hands appearing engaged with the items on the cart, suggesting that the interaction with the medical supplies is still depicted.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the medical monitors are depicted in the background using bold lines and contrasting colors, drawing attention to them in the scene.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patient is depicted in a reclining position on the bed with eyes closed. The relaxed posture is maintained in the pop art style through the use of simplified facial features and a resting body posture. The patient's body lines and the position of the arms suggest a continuation of relaxation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the IV stand remains adjacent to the bed as indicated by the positioning of the stand relative to the patient and the IV bag. The artwork creatively adjusts the color scheme and style but maintains the spatial arrangement of the elements consistent with Image A, suggesting that the IV stand is still next to the bed.",
