      "question": "Are the broccoli florets in both dishes still composed of distinct tree-like branching structures with dark green crowns and lighter green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli florets in both dishes display tree-like branching structures as evidenced by their dark green crowns and lighter green stems. The florets appear intact and maintain their typical appearance seen in fresh or roasted broccoli. Without referring to Image A yet, it can be concluded based on common knowledge and visual cues that their structural integrity remains consistent, which is common for both raw and roasted broccoli.",

      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their compact, rounded, and textured white clusters regardless of size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cauliflower florets that are white, compact, and rounded clusters, maintaining their textured appearance. This visual cue aligns with the common characteristics of cauliflower florets which typically retain their shape and texture regardless of their size or whether they are cooked or raw.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the vegetables in the left dish still bright green (broccoli) and creamy white (cauliflower), without any browning or charring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables in the left dish appear bright green for broccoli and creamy white for cauliflower. The absence of browning or charring indicates they are raw, as these visual characteristics are typical of fresh vegetables. The lighting and the color consistency in the image reinforce the observation that they are uncooked.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vegetables in the right dish still exhibit golden-brown caramelization and dark charred edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables in the right dish show clear signs of caramelization with a golden-brown color and dark charred edges. These visual cues are indicative of roasting, which is consistent with cooked broccoli, commonly resulting in a browned and charred surface from direct heat.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both dishes identical in shape—rectangular with two handles at the top and bottom—and made of white ceramic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts both dishes as rectangular with two handles positioned at the top and bottom, and they appear to be made of white ceramic material. This conforms to the description provided, as their consistent shape and uniform color are characteristics typical of ceramic bakeware. A detailed visual inspection shows no deviation in shape or material.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a background consisting of a light brown wooden surface where horizontal wood grain patterns are visible. These visual cues suggest a typical wooden table or countertop. This observation aligns with the appearance and natural texture often found in wood furnishings.",

      "question": "Is the dish containing raw vegetables positioned on the left, and the dish containing roasted vegetables on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition shows a dish with bright green and creamy white vegetables, characteristic of raw broccoli and cauliflower, to the left. To the right is a dish containing roasted vegetables with a browned appearance. This spatial arrangement follows common presentation logic where raw vegetables are placed on one side, and cooked ones on the other.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the right dish containing roasted vegetables which exhibit visible browning marks and dark charred edges typical of cooking. Additionally, small seasoning specks may be observed scattered among the charred marks. Such details are characteristic of roasted vegetables where seasoning often contributes to the browning effects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates evenly distributed lighting from above, as there are minimal shadows under the dishes and vegetables. The consistent light intensity across the surface suggests overhead lighting, reducing stark shadow lines and enhancing the clear visualization of the image's contents.",
