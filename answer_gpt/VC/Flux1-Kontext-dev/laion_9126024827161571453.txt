    "Question": "Q1: Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main visual objects are not actual batteries but four characters inspired by battery design. While these characters have elements that could be linked to battery design, such as copper-colored tones in their suits, they don't specifically display battery tops themselves.
