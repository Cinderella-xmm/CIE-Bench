      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's crest is indeed upright and vividly blue.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird with distinct white markings around its eye and a black stripe running through its face.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bird inside a glass dome on a perch that resembles wood, but it is not perched on the same type of wooden surface as in Image A, where it is clearly on a wooden fence-like structure. The position within the dome alters the context even though the bird's posture is similar.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary colors of the bird are vibrant blue and white. This is evidenced by the bright blue feathers and prominent white patches on the bird. Image A also features the bird in the same vibrant blue and white, ensuring color consistency across both images.",
