        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating arrangement is depicted with a clear semi-circular form, maintaining the traditional amphitheater design where seats are often arranged in this fashion. The semi-circular configuration is evident with steps radiating outwards from a central point, which is commonly associated with amphitheaters. This indicates that the edited image retains the semi-circular seating arrangement. In Image A, the seating is also arranged in the same semi-circular form. The edited image successfully captures this aspect from the original image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tiered wall with arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features a tiered structure where multiple levels are discernible, each with uniformly spaced arches. This tiered wall with arches is a characteristic element of Roman-style architecture often seen in amphitheaters. Each tier suggests a level of seating or access point, mirroring the design seen in historical amphitheaters. Image A also has this tiered wall with multiple rows of arches which is characteristic of such structures. The edited image retains this multilevel and arch-featured wall structure from the original.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the relationship between the seating and the stage area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited depiction shows a distinct separation between the seating area and the central flat stage area, which is typical of amphitheaters where audiences are positioned to have a clear view of the performance space. This maintains the traditional amphitheater layout where the seating encircles the central stage area. Image A also illustrates this arrangement, with the seating surrounding a defined stage area. The edited image preserves this spatial relationship characteristic of amphitheaters.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the even spacing of the arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows a structure where the arches are placed at regular intervals, creating a symmetry along the tiered wall. This consistency in spacing is typical in architectural design to ensure structural balance and aesthetic uniformity. Image A also shows arches that are evenly spaced, contributing to the structural harmony of the amphitheater. The edited image accurately retains the even spacing of arches from the original.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a structure that depicts an amphitheater-like outline, characterized by its curved, multi-tiered walls with arches and semi-circular seating arrangement surrounding a central stage area. This silhouette is akin to traditional amphitheater designs known for their rounded form and tiered elevations. Image A shows an actual amphitheater with these elements, and the edited image captures this intended design by retaining the overall architectural shape and outline.",
