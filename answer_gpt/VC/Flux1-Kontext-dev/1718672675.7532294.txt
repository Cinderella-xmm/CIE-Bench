    "Question": "Q1: Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cliff face appears to have natural formations, but the visibility of distinct horizontal sedimentary layers is not clear. Sedimentary layers often appear as parallel lines indicating different deposits over time. In this case, the rock surface doesn't clearly exhibit distinct, parallel horizontal lines that are characteristic of sedimentary layers.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a bright, linear reflection of the sun visible on the water surface extending from the horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a clear and bright reflection of the sun is visible on the water, extending towards the viewer from the horizon. This kind of reflection is common when the sun is low in the sky and reflects off the water surface, creating a bright, elongated pathway of light.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple small boats visible on the water surface in the distance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are small shapes visible on the water that resemble boats. These are generally small in size and are seen on the water's surface in the distance, which suggests that they are indeed small boats.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are shrubs and small trees growing along the upper edges and crevices of the cliff?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the upper edges and crevices of the cliff show vegetation that includes shrubs and small trees. This is a typical geological and ecological characteristic where vegetation finds root in crevices and edges for support and growth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a terrain in the foreground near the cliff edge that includes large, irregular boulders and areas with grassy patches. This indicates a typical rugged landscape with natural rock formations and vegetation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the sun located low on the horizon, emitting a warm golden glow across the sky and water?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is positioned low on the horizon, which is often associated with sunrise or sunset. This position usually produces a warm golden glow that spreads across the sky and reflects on the water, which is evident in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the cliff edge form a steep, continuous drop-off directly into the water below?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cliff appears to form a steep drop. However, based on the image, the drop does not seem to continue directly into the water below without interruption. The cliff edge shows a sloped area moving towards the water, but there is no clear continuous drop visible in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
