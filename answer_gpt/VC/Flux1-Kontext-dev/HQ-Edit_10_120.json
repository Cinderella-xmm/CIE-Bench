      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has blurred the woman's face entirely, making it impossible to retain or assess any facial features such as expressions or wrinkles. Since these elements are not visible, the answer is based on the absence of facial attributes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
