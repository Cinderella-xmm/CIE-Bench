        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing figure maintains a classic ballet pose with arms extended. This is a typical gesture for ballet dancers, signaling grace and readiness to dance.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing figure is depicted with a tutu. This attire is commonly associated with ballet, often in light colors like white or pale shades. The tutu in Image B is shaded in a similar light tone as in Image A, where the original doll had a peach-colored tutu.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the seated figure in a pinkish top. This matches the color scheme from Image A, where the seated doll was originally wearing a pink top. The choice of color is consistent between the images, indicating the retention of this design element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both figures are depicted with blonde hair. The standing figure exhibits a braided hairstyle, reflecting the same detail seen in Image A. The consistency in hair color and style supports the notion of unchanged hair characteristics between the two images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two figures with a ballet theme, one standing and one seated, similar to the arrangement in Image A. However, instead of a realistic display table context seen in Image A, Image B uses a stylized format that suggests the same positions but within an illustrative setting.",
