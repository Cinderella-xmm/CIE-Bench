      "question": "Is the full white beard present on the figure’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the image provided, the figure is depicted in a formal setting with facial features largely hidden or blurred, preventing a detailed assessment of beard presence from the visual cues. Generally, a full beard would be noticeable through its distinct texture and volume extending from the facial area to the neckline. Without such indicators and with facial details obscured, it is challenging to confirm the presence of a full white beard.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red or dark tilak mark positioned between the eyebrows on the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Typically, a tilak is a visible mark placed on the forehead, contrasting with the skin tone and situated between the eyebrows for religious or cultural representation. In this image, due to the obscured facial features and lack of facial relief or marks which would otherwise present such a tilak, there is no evidence supporting the presence of a tilak mark.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure displaying an open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An open-mouthed smile showing teeth would visibly alter the facial expression, marked by the mouth being open and teeth visible. Given that facial details are blurred, limiting the ability to discern expressions or mouth details, there's no indication of a smile with visible teeth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure standing upright with arms relaxed at the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure is positioned upright as indicated by posture and full display of the attire with both arms relaxed and visible—typical of a natural stance. These visual cues suggest a formal upright position with arms positioned downward.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in full-body view and centered in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame captures the majority of the figure's body from an upper torso perspective with considerable emphasis on attire. This suggests a standard portrait format rather than full-body coverage. The figure is centered but not shown in full-body view based on visible cues.",

      "question": "Are the natural skin tone and facial texture (including wrinkles) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Natural skin tone and facial texture are typically observed through clarity and detail in the skin. Since the face details are blurred, the authentic skin tone and facial texture, including features like wrinkles, are not discernible or preserved in the image.",
