    {

      "question": "Are the golden tufted grasses clustered around the base of the cactus still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no golden tufted grasses around the base of the cactus. Instead, the area features a vibrant, imaginative cactus structure, and no vegetation is visible in terms of grass clustering around the base. Comparing this with Image A, where golden tufted grasses are clearly visible, it's evident that Image B lacks this element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue-gray succulent plants visible at the base of the cactus in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no succulent plants visible around the base of the cactus. Image B features a surreal cactus-like structure that stands alone without any surrounding plant life. In Image A, there are clearly succulents and other vegetation present, contrasting with the edited image where such elements are absent.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sandy ground with visible pebbles and soil texture still present beneath the cactus in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a smooth, desert-like landscape with a vibrant orange foreground, without any visible pebbles or detailed soil textures. Whereas Image A shows a textured sandy ground with pebbles and soil details, Image B lacks these features, indicating a different artistic approach.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the reddish-brown rolling hills visible in the background behind the cactus in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a seamless orange desert landscape without any hills visible. Image A features reddish-brown rolling hills in the background, providing a distinct contrast between the original and edited images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky gradient from pale blue near the horizon to deeper blue overhead still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is a solid orange color without any gradient. Image A features a natural sky gradient from pale to deep blue, indicating that the edited image has replaced this with a uniform color backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow of the cactus cast directly beneath it, aligned with the direction of midday sunlight, in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does depict shadows cast beneath the cactus creature, and it is consistent with how shadows would appear during midday, aligned in terms of general direction. However, the unique structure of the cactus in Image B would influence the shadow appearance differently from a traditional upright silhouette.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the upright, multi-armed silhouette of the cactus with a central trunk and multiple upward arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a distinctly different cactus structure that looks more fantastical, resembling an animated creature more than a natural cactus. The trunk and arms extend outward and upwards, but in snake-like curls instead of the multi-armed silhouette visible in Image A. Hence, the edited image does not retain the upright multi-armed silhouette observed in the original.",
