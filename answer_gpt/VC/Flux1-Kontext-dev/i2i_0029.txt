    "Question": "Q1: Does the image retain the stark black-and-white contrast characteristic of the zebra's stripes?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a stylized or illustrated version of a zebra, and it maintains a high contrast between the black and white stripes. Zebras are known for their distinctive stripe pattern, which typically features stark contrasts. In this edited image, the stripes maintain this characteristic by having sharp edges and distinct separation between the black and white parts. The zebra's stripes are visually represented with strong, bold lines, thus preserving the stark contrast typical of zebras.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the zebra's mane still upright and striped?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's mane is depicted as upright and continues the stripe pattern seen on the body. Mechanically, zebra manes generally stand upright, supporting the conclusion that this representation is consistent with reality. The mane carries forward the visual pattern observed in zebra anatomy, resembling vertical stripes, typical of zebra manes in natural settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the zebra's ears still pointed and visible?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the zebra with its ears distinctly visible, maintaining a pointed shape, aligned with the typical anatomy of a zebra. Zebras have ears that are often alert, pointed, and noticeable, aiding their sense of hearing. The illustration captures and retains this characteristic in the edited depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the zebra depicted in a grazing posture?",
    "explanation": "The zebra in Image B is shown with its head down towards the grass, which is a common posture for grazing. Zebras, like many herbivorous animals, adopt a head-low position when feeding on grass. This posture is consistent with the grazing behavior commonly associated with zebras, indicating the image depicts this activity accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Is the background still primarily composed of green grass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background remains dominated by green hues, representing grass, albeit in a stylized and somewhat abstract interpretation. The ground is illustrated in green tones, supporting the visual consistency of grassy environments where zebras naturally graze. This approach maintains the portrayal of grass as the predominant background feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
