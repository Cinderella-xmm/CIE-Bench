      "question": "Are the sausages rendered in a reddish-brown color consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages appear to be rendered in a reddish-brown color, a common representation in illustrations to depict roasted or grilled sausages. By examining Image A, the original image, the sausages also display a reddish-brown hue consistent with Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sausages display parallel dark grill marks along their length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sausage shows parallel dark grill marks running along their length, indicating they were grilled or barbecued with grill marks visible. Comparing this with Image A, similar dark grill marks can be seen, confirming Image B's marks match those in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sausages exhibit a glossy, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sausages in Image B appear to have a glossy surface, suggesting a degree of a reflective quality typically due to cooking oils or natural sausage casing. Image A also depicts the sausages with a sheen, reinforcing the idea of a glossy surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three sausages present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there are three sausages depicted. When comparing this with Image A, we again see precisely three sausages being roasted over the fire, confirming the count is identical in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is each sausage attached to a metal skewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sausage appears to be pierced by and attached to individual metal skewers, indicating they are being roasted over an open flame. A comparison with Image A, where each sausage is likewise attached to a metal skewer, confirms this observation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sausages show slight bulging at their ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates sausages with slight bulges at their ends, a typical characteristic of sausages under heat, causing internal pressure to alter their shape slightly. In Image A, the same slight bulging is noticeable at the ends, consistent with Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible reflective highlights on the upper surfaces of the sausages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, highlights can be seen on the sausages' upper surfaces, suggesting a sheen as light reflects off the cooked surface, likely due to oil or moisture. This is consistent with Image A, where similar highlights are observed, portraying the glossy and reflective nature of the sausages.",
