    "Question": "Q1: Is the capybara’s snout shape — including the rounded nose, wide mouth, and visible teeth — preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (sculpture), the visible details such as the rounded nose, wide mouth, and teeth are not discernible. The sculpture does not explicitly depict the detailed features of a capybara's snout, as it appears more stylized and lacks these specific characteristics. Thus, the snout shape is not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the white muzzle area, positioned centrally on the face and extending from the nose to the upper lip, preserved in the sculpture?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture appears to be a stylized golden object without detailed facial features or colors like the white muzzle seen in the original capybara image. Therefore, the white muzzle area is not preserved in the sculpture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the whiskers present and arranged in the same radial pattern from the snout as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture does not display any whiskers or similar fine details that are visible in the original capybara image. The edited image seems to be a smooth, golden object lacking those intricate features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the glasses positioned directly over the eyes, with the frame aligned horizontally across the bridge of the nose?",
    "explanation": "The edited image is a sculpture without any visible glasses or similar components. There is no indication of glasses positioned over eyes or across the nose as seen in the original capybara image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the sweater and shoulder straps positioned on the shoulders and torso in the same way as in the original image?",

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the capybara’s head shape — rounded, broad, and proportionally large relative to the body — preserved in the sculpture?",
