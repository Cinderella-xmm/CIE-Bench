      "question": "Is the central arched doorway with a cross above it present in the same position on the church facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure enclosed within the glass dome shows a church with a central arched doorway on its facade, which has a cross above it. Observing the arrangement and architecture, this doorway appears directly at the center of the church facade. Utilizing general knowledge about church structures, arched doorways with a cross above are typical elements positioned centrally for symmetrical purposes. Thus, the conclusion is that the doorway in Image B is indeed in the same central position on the church facade.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, when examining the position of the round window on the façade of the church, it can be observed that there is indeed a circular window situated directly above the central arched doorway.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the church structure under the glass dome, a bell tower is visible that is topped with a dome and spire on the roof above the main body of the church. The presence of such features is consistent with traditional church architecture where bell towers are typically placed above the roofline. This confirms the presence of the described elements in Image B.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the scene encapsulated within a dome. On the left side of the church, several white umbrellas are visible, shading the tables below them. This suggests a setup for an outdoor seating area, typical in public spaces near churches. Thus, it confirms the presence of white umbrellas positioned over tables to the left of the church.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, when viewed inside the glass dome, does not show any curved stone steps leading up to the church entrance on the right side. The architectural layout seems flat from this perspective, and curved steps would be a notable feature if present.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a building is visible to the left of the church within the domed display, characterized by blue-and-white tiled walls and featuring black metal balconies.
