      "question": "Does the edited image retain the large ears and trunk shape of the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant features prominently large ears and a distinct trunk. The ears are visible on either side of its head and are colored pink, which is typical in animated representations of elephants. The trunk is centered at the front of the elephant's face. These features are fundamental to the iconic representation of elephants, which includes having a large size and a long, strong trunk. Therefore, the edited image maintains the recognizable large ears and trunk of an elephant, as clearly discernible through these visible cues.",

      "question": "Is the hat placed on top of the elephant's head and the collar around its neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, a distinctive yellow hat is on top of the elephant's head, which is a prominent element of the design. Below, the elephant has a red section encircling its neck region, suggesting a collar. In the chibi or caricature style, such accessories are frequently exaggerated or simplified, but they are consistent with the original depiction commonly seen in animated character designs such as Dumbo. These visual elements confirm the placement of the hat and collar as in alignment with a charming animated character style.",

      "question": "Are the eyes of the elephant black in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the elephant's eyes are clearly black with a strong shine that cartoon eyes often have, suggesting reflections within the eyes. This is a common stylistic choice in cute or animated character designs to make the eyes appealing and expressive. Given this observation, the representation of the eyes as black in Image B is evident.",

      "question": "Is the elephant facing forward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is shown with its head directed toward the viewer, featuring a symmetrical presentation with both eyes visible and the whole face being oriented forward. This frontal view is typical when intending to emphasize the quirky and cute features in character designs, often making them more engaging. This direct facing implies that the elephant is indeed oriented forward in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the overall shape of the elephant in the edited image resemble the original block-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of the edited elephant in Image B still bears the same block-style design seen in animated and model designs, characterized by its geometric arrangement and stylized form. While Image B highlights textures and lighting effects, the fundamental structure remains unchanged with visible block formations on the ears, trunk, and body. Thus, the resemblance in the block-style model is clear by observing these similar features between the original and edited image.",
