      "question": "Does the edited image depict exactly eight arms extending from the central head mass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, careful observation shows eight distinct arms extending from the central head mass of the blue octopus sculpture. The visual cues exhibiting eight arms are clear, and the number coincides with the common anatomical structure of an octopus, known to have eight arms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a distinct, rounded central head mass from which all arms originate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a blue octopus sculpture with a clearly defined and distinct central head mass from which all arms originate. This rounded central structure aligns with typical octopus anatomy where the head is bulbous and rounded, serving as the core from which the arms extend. The visual cues in Image B show a notable spherical shape for the head.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms exhibit a flowing, undulating arrangement that mirrors the wave patterns of the original ocean scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are displayed in an arranged and somewhat stylized manner, reflecting an artistic, fixed pose rather than dynamic movement. The edited image does not portray arms flowing or undulating like those in Image A which are interacting with the ocean waves in a dynamic manner. Therefore, the blue sculpture's arms do not mirror the wave patterns from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible surface textures on the sculptures that mimic the original skin's ridges and suction cup patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue octopus sculpture displays a smooth surface with stylized scales on the head and simplified nodules on the arms. These features differ from the biological texture and suction cup patterns seen on the octopus in Image A, where skin ridges and distinct suction cups are vividly detailed. Therefore, the sculpture in Image B does not mimic the original skin's textures from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sculpture maintain the same general silhouette and proportional relationship between the head and arms as the original octopus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B shows a central head mass and eight arms similar to the octopus in Image A. However, while the overall silhouette appears consistent with the octopus design, the proportions are stylized with a more exaggerated, cartoonish aesthetic. The proportional relation in Image B is artistically altered compared to the realistic depiction in Image A. Thus, while the silhouette reflects an octopus form, the proportional relationship differs.",
