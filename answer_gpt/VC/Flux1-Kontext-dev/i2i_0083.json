      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armchairs are visually depicted with brown fabric upholstery, which is a common color for warm-toned and cozy furniture.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two armchairs positioned on either side of the central display area, which is the large painting.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall is depicted as a plain, solid white surface, providing a neutral backdrop that is typical of minimalist and modern interior designs. This plainness helps to enhance the focus on the center painting and the furniture without distraction.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a floor with a shiny surface that reflects light, indicative of a glossy finish. The discernible grain pattern suggests a wooden texture, a popular choice for warm and elegant flooring in home interiors. The visual cues combined with understanding of interior materials indicate a polished wood texture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the armchairs, subtle shading is visible on the floor, suggesting soft shadows. This effect occurs due to lighting interacting with the furniture, which is consistent with world knowledge about how light behaves in an indoor setting to create soft shadows.",
