    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central waterfall positioned vertically in the middle of the image, descending from the upper cliff to the river below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the waterfall is slightly to the right of the center based on visual cues. The waterfall descends vertically from the cliff into the river. This setup creates a central focal point but is not perfectly aligned with the vertical center due to natural asymmetry. Common sense tells us that objects can be slightly off-centered and still appear central in a composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, curved tree on the left side of the image with a diagonal branch extending upward and bearing clusters of small purple flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a large, curved tree on the left side of the image with branches extending upward. The presence of clusters of small illuminated elements resembling flowers supports this description. World knowledge helps identify these features, as trees often have flowers in clusters along their branches.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the river originate in the foreground and curve toward the base of the central waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river can be observed starting in the foreground and flowing back towards the base of the waterfall. This is identifiable through the natural flow depicted. Consistency with the norms of water flow from foreground to background suggests a pathway leading towards the water source in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks scattered along the riverbed in the foreground and midground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows rocks visible along the riverbed. Using world knowledge, rivers usually consists of rocky beds due to erosion and sediment deposition. These natural formations appear scattered, confirming the presence of rocks in both the foreground and midground.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there two smaller waterfalls visible on the right-hand cliff face, behind the main waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appear to be smaller waterfalls visible in the background, slightly to the right. Using knowledge of waterfall formation, cliff faces often host multiple water streams and cascades creating an appearance of smaller surrounding waterfalls.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense canopy at the top of the image with sunlight streaming through gaps, creating bright patches on the foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B offers a dense canopy visible at the top with light streaming through it, producing bright patches. This is supported by the pattern of light diffusion through leafy canopies as known from natural environments, creating varied light patterns on foliage.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small purple flowers growing on the left side of the twisted tree, near the base of its branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the twisted tree on the left side does display elements resembling flowers, with a prominent blue hue. These appear near the base of the branches, consistent with the description. World knowledge aids in identifying such botanical features in natural settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there multiple mountain ridges receding into the background, fading into a hazy blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several mountain ridges that recede into the background. The sky, while shown in a bluer hue due to the nighttime appearance, becomes hazy toward the horizon as is typical with distance and atmosphere interaction in landscapes, confirming this observation.",
