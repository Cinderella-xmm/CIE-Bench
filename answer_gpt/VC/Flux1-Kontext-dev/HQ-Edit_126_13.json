      "question": "Is the black cast-iron teapot with a curved handle and domed lid present in the same position on the left side of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a teapot with a curved handle and domed lid on the left side of the table, similar to that in Image A. However, the teapot in Image B appears to be a part of an illustrative diagram rather than a photo-realistic depiction. The position and general appearance seem consistent between the two images.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diagram shows a tea bowl on a tray to the right of the teapot, similar to Image A. However, the artistic rendering makes it less detailed, but its position and relative location on the tray match with Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a vase with flowers occupying the upper right region of the surface, which matches the placement and basic characteristics in Image A, though it appears more stylized in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, trays with engraved bamboo leaf patterns are present beneath both the teapot and the tea bowl, as in Image A. The illustrative style provides less detail, but key elements, such as the patterns, seem to be represented.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visually depict floating cherry blossom petals around the vase. Unlike Image A, where petals are visibly present, the diagrammatic style of Image B does not include such details around the vase.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
