      "question": "Is the \"Gibson\" logo in gold script visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object does not resemble a guitar but a dragon breathing fire, which deviates significantly from a guitar structure where one might find a headstock or logo. Therefore, there is no evidence of a 'Gibson' logo in this image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly six fiery tendrils extending from the bridge to the headstock area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dragon with a few fiery elements possibly symbolizing the dragon's breath. However, there is no guitar structure with a bridge and headstock present in this image to have fiery tendrils extending between those parts.",

      "question": "Is the guitar oriented vertically with the neck pointing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B again does not feature a guitar. Instead, it shows a dragon, which is not oriented in a manner typical of a guitar, being vertical with the neck pointing upward. This question does not apply to the dragon imagery.",
