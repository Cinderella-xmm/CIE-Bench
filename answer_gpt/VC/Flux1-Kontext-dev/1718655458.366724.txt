    "Question": "Q1: Is the flowing brown and gray marbled pattern visible on the surfaces of the LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks feature marbled patterns, but only with warm brown veins rather than both brown and gray. For a brow and gray description to be true, both colors in the pattern would need to be apparent. Hence, there is no visible gray marbling mixed with the brown on the bricks' surfaces in Image B based on its appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the LEGO bricks rendered with a white base color accented by warm brown and gray marbling?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks display a white base color, which is evident, and this white surface includes swirling patterns. These patterns contain warm brown veins which are prominent; however, the marbling does not include gray alongside brown. Therefore, while the description of the base color and warm brown is accurate, gray is absent from the observed marbling pattern.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the marbled veins follow an organic, irregular flow rather than a geometric or repetitive pattern?",
    "explanation": "Examining the marbled pattern on the LEGO bricks in Image B, the veins exhibit an organic and irregular flow, mimicking natural marble patterns. Such flowing designs do not adhere to geometric shapes or repetitive sequences, emulating a more natural stone appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are both warm brown and gray veins present together in the marbled pattern of the LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the marbled pattern on the LEGO bricks clearly shows warm brown veins, but there is no clear indication or presence of gray veins. For both colors to be considered present, they would have to be distinctly visible, which is not the case here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the LEGO bricks visually appear to be made of a marble-like material based on their surface pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the LEGO bricks is designed with a pattern that resembles natural marble, consisting of an intricate arrangement of veins and texture that mimics the appearance of marble. The organic and flowing nature of these veins, alongside the white base, contributes to a marble-like appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
