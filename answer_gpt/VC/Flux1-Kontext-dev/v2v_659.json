      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the large, round brown eyes present and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is obscured, preventing us from visually confirming the presence or symmetry of the eyes. World knowledge on facial symmetry typically indicates that eyes are positioned symmetrically, but since the face is blurred, this visual detail cannot be confirmed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the girl is adorned with a tiara that mirrors the form and placement of the original tiara observed. The visual cue of a sparkling and intricate design with multiple points signifies a tiara, consistent across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, making it impossible to determine or analyze the shape of the face or the specific features such as the nose or mouth.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
