      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the position of the snowboarder's feet and the visible object beneath them, known as a snowboard, it's common knowledge that snowboards are used for snowboarding and usually positioned under the feet when in use.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, looking at the snowboarder's boots and the snowboard beneath, there's a visible connection between the boots and the snowboard, indicating they are fastened through bindings.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the snowboarder appears to carry a backpack with visible shoulder straps.
