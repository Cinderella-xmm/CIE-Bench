      "question": "Is the lionâ€™s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk is not visible in the same form as in Image A, but a wooden box with a drawer is present. By analyzing the design on the box, a decorative element resembling a lion's head medallion is seen attached to the drawer handle. This visually suggests that the thematic lion's head element is retained in the editing, even if not located on a desk panel.",

      "question": "Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quill retains a distinct feather-like shape, featured prominently on the wooden box's upper panel. Despite being stylized with metallic decor, its silhouette and general form resonate with the traditional feather shape, showcasing continuity of design intent from the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a diary or notebook with pages open and facing upwards. The coloration of the pages appears beige or light tan, echoing the aged appearance seen in older documents. Despite a slight difference in context, the idea of showing pages is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the desk retain its dark wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A's visual cues, the overall tone of the box and items within Image B are more of a lighter wood, losing the darker wood texture and finish seen in the original desk.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no such window or backdrop is present; instead, the scene focuses entirely on the objects, removing the window aspect seen in Image A. Therefore, the arched window is not visible.",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is isolated from any room interior, and no bookshelves or books are visible. This large change suggests the background has been dramatically simplified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors dark brown, cream, and deep red/blue consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to favor lighter wood tones, diverging from the dark browns, deep reds, and creams evident in Image A. This choice gives a lighter and more simplified aesthetic.",
