      "question": "Is the Great Wall depicted as a continuous, zigzagging structure following the contours of the mountain ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction within the snow globe shows a continuous structure mimicking the zigzagging nature of a large wall following mountain contours. This design is characteristic of the Great Wall of China as known from historical and geographical knowledge, indicating the wall’s strategic construction to mirror natural land formations. The edited replication in the globe retains these key attributes, confirming its identity.",

      "question": "Are the walls constructed with visible gray stone bricks and topped with crenellated battlements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the section of the wall visible inside the snow globe shows a structure consisting of materials resembling gray stone bricks, with a detailed top that draws from crenellated battlements. This construction is typical of many sections of the Great Wall, where such features are designed for defensive purposes, securing the historic identity of the monument within the snow globe.",

      "question": "Are there watchtowers visible at regular intervals along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, which replicates the view inside a snow globe, presents details of the wall but offers a limited view due to its globe-like encapsulation. Typically, watchtowers are present along the Great Wall, spaced regularly for monitoring historical invasions, yet the cropped composition in the snow globe limits the clear identification of these structured intervals.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trees surrounding the wall display bright autumn colors, including yellow, orange, and red foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual encapsulation inside the snow globe shows a landscape where trees mostly appear in hues of green and some with orange and red, indicative of autumn. However, the clarity and saturation are influenced by the snow globe stylistic effects and the prominent autumn colors aren’t distinctly bold throughout; still, elements of red maple leaves are artificially added, enhancing an autumn theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe depicted in Image B, a large, rounded rock formation is still visible, situated prominently near the wall on the right side. This feature appears to be an integral part of the structure’s portrayal, suggesting it remains a consistent element within both images when conveying the environment surrounding the wall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited encapsulation in Image B captures small human figures on the wall, illustrating typical touristic activities – some individuals are standing, showcasing static engagement with the site, while others are climbing, suggesting movement, primarily upwards along steps, reinforcing the life-like activity representation within the globe.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which frames the Great Wall scene inside a snow globe, details such as stone steps are visibly etched out which leads along the wall, conforming to the architectural aspect of many sections of the Great Wall where stone steps are constructed to navigate the terrain. This detail enhances the accuracy of the scene replicated within the snow globe representation.",
