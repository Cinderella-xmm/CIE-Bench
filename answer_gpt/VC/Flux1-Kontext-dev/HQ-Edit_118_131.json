        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the elephant's head is distinct and detailed, showcasing large flared ears and a visible eye. The craftsmanship emphasizes these features which are characteristic of an elephant's appearance. This observation is straightforward as the emphasis on the elephant's head design is intentionally prominent, making it a focal point of the teapot design.",

      "question": "Is the trunk of the elephant clearly formed into the spout of the teapot, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design seamlessly integrates the elephant's trunk as the spout of the teapot, extending elegantly upward and slightly backward. The smooth transition between the animal feature and functional teapot element reflects intentional design choices often seen in creative art pieces involving animal motifs. The trunk's formation into a spout is clearly defined, supported by the visual structure observed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals four distinct legs visibly supporting the body of the elephant-teapot. These legs are designed to resemble the real structure of an elephant, ensuring stability typical for teapot designs that leverage animal bodies for aesthetic purposes. The visual effect is clear, emphasizing these supportive limbs as part of the overall design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, a domed lid with a pointed finial can clearly be seen at the top of the teapot. This element is traditional in teapot design, ensuring functionality for lid removal while also serving as a decorative feature. Combining visual cues from the image with common design aspects of teapots confirms the presence of this characteristic element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts intricate engraving of floral patterns across the teapot's surface, including recognizable lotus flowers and vines. Such decorative motifs are often used in ornamental metalwork, especially in styles inspired by traditional Eastern designs. The visibility and clarity of these patterns in the image indicate that they are a central decorative feature, enhancing the visual appeal of the teapot.",

      "question": "Is the teapot primarily rendered in a silver metallic finish with reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B shows that the teapot is rendered primarily in a bronze metallic finish rather than silver, with warm reflective highlights observed across the surface. The choice of color may align more with bronze aesthetics, offering a rich, antique look rather than silver’s cool tone. Using knowledge of metal finishes and decorative styles helps clarify this distinction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cup and saucer visibly placed next to the teapot, which appear to match the teapot's style with metallic elements. However, the cup and saucer seem to be made from the same bronze material rather than silver, aligning with the overall theme and finish observed in the teapot. This analysis involves recognizing material textures and color properties, discernible through visual examination.",
