        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's back is shown to the viewer, which indicates that he is walking away. This is a common way to depict someone walking away, as their back would be visible rather than their face. The scene also shows a street continuing into the distance, supporting the interpretation that the man is walking along it.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can clearly see the man holding a brown briefcase or bag in his right hand. This is apparent from the positioning of the briefcase and the grip of his hand around the handle, which matches the typical way a briefcase is held.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the man wearing a blue jacket that visually resembles a denim jacket in terms of seams and structure. While examining the visual cues combined with world knowledge, such jackets are typically recognized as denim by their color and stitching style, even if the material appearance suggests a smoother texture.",

Although the texture may differ from the original, the fundamental structure remains intact and recognizable as typical street-side buildings.",
