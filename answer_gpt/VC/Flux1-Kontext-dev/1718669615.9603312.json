      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks are visible and extend into the distance. However, they do not appear strictly parallel like traditional railway tracks; instead, they have an artistic, flowing design. World knowledge about railway construction suggests tracks are typically parallel, but the edited image retains two tracks extending, albeit with a stylized representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks appear to curve as they recede into the distance. The stylized representation gives a sense of the tracks curving and moving through the landscape, similar to how roads or tracks might curve to follow terrain in real life. This artistic design gives the impression of curves to the right as part of the background scenery.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the UFO is positioned slightly off-center with respect to the railway track. The artistic depiction places the UFO towards the middle of the image but not directly above the very central axis of the track as defined by the landscape design. This positioning adds to a dynamic composition in the edited scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized landscape without a clear, straight horizontal line separating the sky from the land. Instead, the hills and tracks create a varied edge where they meet the sky, reflecting common landscape designs without a simple linear horizon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic depiction of the railway tracks gives them a sense of elevation above some surrounding areas, showing an artistic interpretation akin to tracks on embankments or elevated areas. This styled ground forms part of the design of the landscape, offering a visually elevated effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the railway tracks has them converging towards a single point on the horizon. This perspective technique gives depth to the image, resembling the vanishing point concept commonly used in art to depict distance.",
