    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a clear, elongated blue area that runs from the bottom of the image towards the background, narrowing as it approaches the mountains. This blue area is framed by banks of brightly colored trees and reflects the sky and surrounding environment, which are characteristic features of a river in a landscape. The placement directly down the center supports the interpretation of it being a river.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two large mountain peaks visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop features two prominent triangular shapes that are sharply pointed and rise higher than the surrounding elements. These are characteristics typically associated with mountain peaks. They are positioned symmetrically with one peak on the left and the other on the right side of the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular light source positioned near the center of the horizon line in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, towards the center of the image, above the mountains, there's a bright circular object that emits light. This is consistent with the appearance of the sun, which typically sits around the horizon or sky region in natural landscapes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there trees present on both sides of the river, extending along the banks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both sides of the central blue area labeled as the river are lined with plant life that extends vertically up and down the length of these banks, featuring dense arrangements. The visual abundance and the structure resemble tree lines that commonly border rivers in landscapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible rock formations or landmasses within the river, breaking the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there are objects of a different color tone and texture located within the blue river area that rise above the surface, suggesting they are not part of the water. The positioning and look are indicative of rocks or small islands, commonly interrupting the flow of rivers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the river reflect the trees and sky above it, maintaining a mirrored image across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the river shows the colored hues and shapes closely matching those of the trees and sky above, inverted vertically. This indicates the presence of reflections, creating the effect of a mirror image which is typical for calm bodies of water like rivers.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the trees on the riverbanks colored in warm autumn tones such as red, orange, and yellow, with dark green conifers interspersed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees alongside the river in Image B show bright colors in red, orange, and yellow tones, typical of autumn foliage. Additionally, the contrast is seen through the scattered presence of trees in dark green, indicative of conifers, creating visual diversity characteristic of mixed woodland in the fall.",
