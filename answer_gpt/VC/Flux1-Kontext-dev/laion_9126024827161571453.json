      "question": "Are the battery tops rendered in copper color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main visual objects are not actual batteries but four characters inspired by battery design. While these characters have elements that could be linked to battery design, such as copper-colored tones in their suits, they don't specifically display battery tops themselves. Therefore, the question of battery tops doesn't directly apply here, but if considering the visual inspiration, it might be interpreted as representing copper elements.",

      ],
