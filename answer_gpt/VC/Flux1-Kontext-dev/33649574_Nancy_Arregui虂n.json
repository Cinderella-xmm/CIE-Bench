      "question": "Is the rooster’s comb present on top of its head in a prominent, upright position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's comb is clearly visible on top of its head, prominently displayed in an upright position. The comb is vividly colored and stands out against the rooster's body, which is consistent with the typical prominence of a rooster's comb. This conclusion is drawn from common knowledge about rooster anatomy combined with the visual cues from the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red fleshy wattles visible under the rooster’s beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the rooster with visible red fleshy wattles hanging under its beak, which are typical features of a rooster. These wattles are an integral part of rooster anatomy, aiding in thermo-regulation. The analysis involves recognizing the red fleshy structures near the mandibular region, confirming their presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rooster’s beak clearly visible and positioned at the front of the face, with a pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's beak is clearly positioned at the front of its face and has a pointed tip, consistent with the typical beak shape of birds, particularly roosters. The image provides clear visibility of the beak structure, which resembles what is commonly observed in roosters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the rooster have two legs with three forward-facing toes and one rear toe on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the rooster with two legs, each having three forward-pointing toes and one rear toe. This anatomical configuration is a standard structure among birds, allowing them to grip and balance effectively. The visual information confirms these details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the rooster standing on a dark gray asphalt surface with visible debris such as leaves and small plant fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fantasy-themed rooster standing amidst flames, not on a physical ground like asphalt. The image does not depict any dark gray surface or debris such as leaves, which would be expected in a realistic setting. The analysis shows a departure from the expected ground environment, indicating a non-standard setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rooster standing upright with its head raised and one foot slightly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster is indeed depicted with an upright posture, head raised confidently, and one foot appears to be forward, conveying motion and assertiveness. This stance matches the typical pose of a rooster when it is alert and ready to move, drawn from common observations of rooster behavior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the rooster with a tail positioned at the rear, extending upward in a dramatically curved and stylized shape. This alignment follows the expected anatomical layout for roosters, with artistic enhancements to emphasize grandeur. The portrayal uses exaggerated tail features to enhance visual impact while maintaining anatomical accuracy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's neck and chest feathers are distinctly arranged in overlapping layers, exhibiting a vibrant golden-orange hue. The layering provides texture and depth, common in birds to allow for efficient flight and protection. The hue corresponds with expectations for the coloring of rooster feathers, drawn from general knowledge of rooster appearances.",
