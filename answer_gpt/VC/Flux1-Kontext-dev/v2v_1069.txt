    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fan is encased in a transparent spherical dome with the center hub illuminated and small sparkles scattered around. The edited image clearly shows that the fan still possesses four blades arranged in a similar manner to a standard ceiling fan. With this visual cue, one can conclude that the edited image still retains the original four blades.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the central hub structure of the ceiling fan still present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central hub of the fan is clearly visible in the middle of the sphere and retains its original design. The structure of this hub appears consistent with typical fan designs, maintaining its shape and position, which indicates the central hub structure is still present.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "The metallic texture and color scheme observed in Image A, characterized by a brushed metallic appearance, is retained in Image B. The image under lighting conditions accentuates the metallic look, maintaining its original characteristics. Thus, the edited image preserves these aspects.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the blades arranged symmetrically around the central hub in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blades are visibly and neatly arranged around the central hub, suggesting a symmetric pattern. This is similar to Image A, where the blades are balanced around the central axis, a typical trait of ceiling fans. Therefore, the symmetric arrangement is preserved.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the connection points between the blades and the central hub visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the points where each blade meets the hub are distinct and visible. This mirrors the original image's depiction where the connection points are clearly detailed. Hence, these points are still visible in the edited presentation.",
    "answer": "yes"
