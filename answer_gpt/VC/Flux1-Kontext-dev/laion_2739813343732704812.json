    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's beak appears to be cartoonish and simplified, and the area beneath the lower mandible does not depict a pronounced gular pouch typically seen in pelicans. The artist's rendition prioritizes simplicity over anatomical accuracy, likely omitting or minimizing the gular pouch for a stylistic effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cartoon rendition of the bird's feet. While the feet exhibit a stylized shape, the webbing is subtly suggested but not clearly defined with claws at the tips of each toe. The artistic depiction favors a playful and exaggerated form, potentially bypassing detailed anatomical features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bird with feathers rendered in broad, smooth strokes and vivid colors rather than detailed overlapping edges and visible shafts. The cartoon style simplifies the texture and form of the feathers, focusing on an appealing design rather than realistic detail.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon bird is portrayed with a long neck, curving modestly from the head to the body. Despite the abstract representation, the neck and body maintain proportions consistent with the bird's natural form, albeit in a stylized manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pelican's legs are shown with one leg slightly forward and another positioned backward in a stylized manner. The legs suggest support but are not drawn in a clearly grounded pose like Image A, highlighting aesthetic preference over anatomical accuracy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a single dark, round eye visible on the side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the cartoon bird with a single large, dark, round eye that is exaggerated and centered on the head, adhering to typical cartoon aesthetics that emphasize expressive features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a small tuft of feathers raised at the crown of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit any tuft of feathers at the crown of the head. The cartoon depiction opts for a smooth head shape without additional feather details, focusing on its simplified character design instead.",
