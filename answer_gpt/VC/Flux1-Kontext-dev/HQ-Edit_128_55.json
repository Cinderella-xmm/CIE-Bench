        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a golden spherical knocker positioned at the center of the lower half of the door. This is determined by observing the visual similarity in the door's central region, which retains its original design from Image A. The knocker maintains a similar size and placement, reinforcing the conclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a door with intricate geometric carvings that are visible across both panels, especially in the upper and lower sections. These patterns resemble traditional architectural designs, and the enhanced details are discernible even with the added elements surrounding the door. This observation aligns with the original design seen in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizontal rows of black metal studs are visible and exhibit uniform alignment across both panels of the door. This parallel arrangement mirrors the design seen in Image A, where the studs contribute to the symmetry and balance of the door's aesthetic.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible surrounding wall made of textured, earth-toned adobe with cracks and peeling plaster. Instead, the surrounding area features an enhanced backdrop with dark tones and decorative wings and a crown, eliminating any indication of similar wall characteristics from Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible small square window with a blue mosaic tile pattern located to the right of the doorframe. The enhanced artistic elements surrounding the door, such as the wings and crown, have obscured or replaced the area where a window would be prominent in Image A.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground does appear to be composed of rectangular paving stones arranged in a herringbone pattern, as evidenced by the distinct and recognizable pattern seen at the base of the door. This remains consistent with the ground design observed in Image A.",
