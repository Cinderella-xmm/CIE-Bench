      "question": "Are the cookies still golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies appear to be golden-yellow, indicating they are likely baked. World knowledge suggests that cookies often have a golden-yellow hue when baked to achieve the desired texture and flavor. This hue results from the Maillard reaction during baking. Thus, based on the visual cues, the cookies are still golden-yellow.",

      "question": "Is there a red jam filling in the center of each cookie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cookies with a visible red substance in the center of each, which resembles jam. World knowledge indicates that jam is often used as filling in cookies for added flavor and visual interest. The consistent placement in the center aligns with common cookie designs. Comparing with Image A, the cookies also have red filling, supporting the consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mug white with black speckles and a handle on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug is a consistent light pink without black speckles as seen visually and from world knowledge that pure colors are often chosen for aesthetic consistency in certain designs. The handle is on the right side in both images. This comparison clarifies that the mug's color in Image B differs from Image A, which is white with black speckles.",

      "question": "Is the plate pink with a speckled texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate is pink displaying a smooth surface without speckled texture based on visual cues. This suggests a solid color choice often used in serving ware for simplicity and style. Comparing to Image A, where speckled texture is present, confirms the difference in plate design between the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are some cookies inside the mug and others arranged on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several cookies placed inside the mug and additional cookies positioned on the plate surrounding it, indicating a common presentation style for displaying baked goods attractively for accessibility and aesthetics. This arrangement is observed similarly in Image A, supporting consistency in presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both the mug and the plate have a speckled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither the mug nor the plate exhibit a speckled surface; both have a consistent color finish, which aligns with design choices that favor solid colors for cohesiveness. Image A, however, features speckled surfaces for both, allowing distinct comparison where Image B deviates in texture preference.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual evidence in Image B shows the mug is indeed smaller than the plate, positioned at the center, which facilitates stability and visual balance in serving arrangements. This common setup matches the presentation style in Image A, reinforcing consistency in positioning relative to the plate size.",
