      "question": "Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two garage doors are visible side by side on the lower front portion. Above these, instead of a traditional window section as seen in Image A, there are circular features resembling eyes. This indicates that the garage doors in Image B are indeed below the modified upper section of the cabin.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a traditional multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams above the garage doors.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the cabin shows windows with a green decorative design, but these occupy a much larger area and are not simple rectangular cutouts.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a doorway to the right of a small rectangular window on the left side of the cabin. The left side is covered with detailed decorations and the presence of large, noticeable designs mirrors the stylistic changes seen throughout the edited image.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a green, grass-like cover running along the lower perimeter of the cabin, which gives an impression of being integrated with nature. This effect covers the section where the concrete foundation is visible in Image A.",
