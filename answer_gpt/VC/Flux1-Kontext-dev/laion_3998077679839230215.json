      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lehenga is shown with vertical motifs that resemble paisleys, which are a common design element in Indian fashion, especially for bridal or festive wear. The depiction suggests a rich design, and while comparing with Image A, the red inner lining at the hem in the illustration supports this feature as a distinct contrast to the purple fabric, which is typical for traditional lehengas to add vibrancy.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dupatta shown in Image B is distinctly red, outlined with what could be interpreted as a silver zari border, a traditional component often used to add luxurious detailing to fabric edges. The scattered star-like embroidery across the fabric is consistent with embellishments used to enhance a garment's elegance and appeal, often found in Indian fashion.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central maang tikka, a traditional piece of jewelry worn on the forehead in many Indian cultures, is depicted as part of the ensemble.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being more of a character-focused fashion illustration, doesn't depict a background with detailed wall patterns. Hence, it does not contain any damask-style floral design in golden-brown tones, focusing solely on the attire and related accessories.",
