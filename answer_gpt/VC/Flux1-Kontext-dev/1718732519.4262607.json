      "question": "Is the hot dog represented as an elongated, straight object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is represented in a toy-like manner with bright, solid colors and appears to have a straight and elongated shape. The representation resembles a typical hot dog with a sausage in a bun, adhering to the standard elongated and straight structure associated with hot dogs. This observation can be concluded by combining visual cues with background knowledge of common hot dog shapes.",

      "question": "Is the hot dog placed horizontally on the wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the hot dog is oriented in a horizontal position, lying lengthwise along the wooden base. This horizontal placement is typical for serving hot dogs on surfaces or plates and is evident from the way the hot dog aligns with the base.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the hot dog and the bottle placed on a flat wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the bottle and the hot dog are resting on a flat surface. The wooden base under the hot dog is distinct and raised, while the bottle sits directly on this flat surface, likely a table. This can be discerned from the alignment and positioning of both objects in the setting provided.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the spatial arrangement in Image B, the bottle is clearly located to the left of the hot dog as one looks at the composition. This is a simple positional relationship where the bottle sequentially precedes the hot dog from left to right.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hot dog placed on a raised wooden platform distinct from the main table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog is positioned on what appears to be a separate wooden cutting board or platform. This board acts as a raised surface distinct from the main table where the bottle is placed. This detail can be identified from the visible height difference between the platform and the surrounding surface flatness.",
