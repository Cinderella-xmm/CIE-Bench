      "question": "Is the American flag patch present on the right shoulder of the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is illustrated in a cartoonish style with a simplified suit design. The flag patch is present on the right shoulder, but it does not resemble the American flag. Instead, it appears to display differently patterned flag patches on each shoulder, which do not match the American flag design. Thus the astronaut lacks the American flag on their uniform.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue NASA insignia patch visible on the left shoulder of the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the astronaut in a cartoon style where the shoulder patches are simplified and do not represent specific insignia such as NASA's. There is no distinct blue NASA logo visible on the left shoulder, as the illustration style does not include such details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is Earth visible in the reflection within the astronaut’s helmet visor, appearing above the lunar horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an artistic depiction of Earth in the helmet visor, illustrating a fictional or exaggerated representation rather than a realistic reflection. Hence, Earth does appear depicted in the visor but not in a realistic reflection context.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the International Space Station visible in the background with its solar panels and modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a realistic depiction or detailed outline of the International Space Station. It primarily uses a cartoon style focusing on the astronaut's dynamics rather than background elements, including the ISS. Thus, its presence is not noticeable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ground beneath the astronaut visibly cratered and gray, consistent with the Moon’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a simplified, cartoon-like lunar environment beneath the astronaut. The ground is depicted in a blue tone with minimal crater-like patterns, diverging from a realistic gray and cratered Moon surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the astronaut facing forward with both side lights on the helmet illuminated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is drawn in a forward-facing cartoon style. However, the helmet does not feature side lights as in a realistic space suit. Instead, the focus is on visual storytelling with exaggerated graphic elements absent specific lighting on the helmet.",
