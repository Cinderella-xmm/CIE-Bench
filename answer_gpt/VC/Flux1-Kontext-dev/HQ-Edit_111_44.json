      "question": "Is the elderly woman’s face clearly visible with deep wrinkles and dark skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the elderly woman's face is deliberately blurred, so the texture and details like wrinkles cannot be clearly discerned. The image editing specifically obscures the visibility of facial details. Therefore, without being able to discern these features, it’s clear that the face’s detailed visibility is not present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central figure standing upright with her hands clasped in front of her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is standing upright, and her posture suggests that she is holding or clasping her hands in front of her, which is a common stance observed visually. This conclusion is based on observing the position of the hands and the overall stance, which suggests stability and an upright position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large tanned fabric canopy stretched overhead, providing shade over the market?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible cues indicating the presence of a large canopy; the sky is visible directly, suggesting that the market is outdoors and without any coverage overhead. The lack of shading elements like a canopy or fabric overhead confirms this conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the market goods placed in woven baskets on a stone-paved ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the market goods clearly placed in what appear to be woven baskets. The ground appears stone-paved, consistent with traditional market settings where goods are displayed in baskets for easy access and presentation. This visual observation aligns with the common setting of traditional markets.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is adorned with multiple stacked bangles visible on both her arms. This detail is clearly discernible through the image, showing a common characteristic of cultural attire where decorative and elaborate bangles are worn. Visual cues confirm the presence of stacked bangles.",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents visual cues of buildings lining the market alley, with textiles hanging on both sides. The texture and color of the buildings suggest mud-brick constructions, complementing the traditional and historical setting. Observation confirms the presence of these architectural elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman holding a small wooden bowl in her hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure's hands appear to be holding and clasping in front of her body, but there is no visual evidence of a small wooden bowl being held. The focus seems to be on the posture rather than any object in her hands, which leads to the conclusion of the absence of a bowl.",
