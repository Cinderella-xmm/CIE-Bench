      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug's black muzzle and surrounding facial markings including around the nose and under the eyes are evident. These markings are classic identifiers of pug features, providing contrast and character to the face. In comparison to Image A, these facial markings appear in the same areas, suggesting they have been preserved accurately in the sculpture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug's eyes are large, round, and dark with defined pupils, which are characteristic features of a pug.

      "question": "Are the floppy black ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head and shaped as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture shows the pug's floppy ears symmetrically positioned on top of the head, although they are slightly different in shape from the original. While the original image, Image A, shows the ears with a more relaxed and natural droop, the sculpture in Image B seems to depict the ears in a simpler form, potentially due to artistic stylization. Hence, the resemblance is not exact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture portrays the pug sitting upright with its front paws placed forward. This positioning matches common anatomies of pugs when sitting, displaying an endearing and attentive posture. Upon comparison with Image A, the position of the pug's body and paws remains consistent, showing clear intent to replicate the original stance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture maintains the fawn-colored body which contrasts with the black muzzle and facial markings. This color pattern is characteristic of pugs, akin to those seen in Image A. The regions where the fawn color transitions into black markings reflect the traditional pug coloring, indicating preservation in the sculpture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B depicts a pug with a broad head relative to its compact body, a typical proportion seen in pugs. This head-to-body ratio is essential for capturing the breed's recognizable stout and sturdy appearance. Comparing this with Image A, both images maintain this proportion, verifying consistency between the original and the sculpture.",
