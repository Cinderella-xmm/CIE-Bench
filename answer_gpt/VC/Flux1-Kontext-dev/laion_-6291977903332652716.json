      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings feature visible wooden beams that form geometric patterns typical of half-timbered construction. This architectural style often incorporates beams that traverse the facade in a grid or diagonal lattice format, which appears to be accurately represented in the edited image. The visibility and arrangement of the beams suggest attention to structural detail, thus aligning with common architectural knowledge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From world knowledge, steeply pitched gabled roofs are prominent in traditional European architecture. Image B displays such roofs on the buildings. However, dormer windows positioned at regular intervals are not discernible, as the edited image focuses more on the overall structure and possibly omits small details like window spacing.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analysis of the midground reveals a bridge crossing over the canal, perceived by observing the structural layout within urban environments. Considering common architectural designs of historical towns where pedestrian bridges connect streets, its presence is logical and thus supported by visual cues.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the canal water reflecting the buildings and sky above, an effect typically observed in calm water bodies due to their reflective nature. The clarity of this reflection suggests a mirror-like quality, indicating attention to detail in the visualization process of the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, green plants in flower boxes are visible on the balcony of the prominent building to the right. This aligns with common urban landscaping practices where plants in boxes are placed to enhance the aesthetic appeal of building facades.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, close observation of the canal edges indicates the presence of stone bases and metal railings, common infrastructural elements found in many canal-side environments to ensure safety and maintain structural integrity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows windows arranged predominantly in vertical and horizontal alignments, consistent with the divisions created by the timber framing. This organization is characteristic of buildings with half-timbered construction, where structural and aesthetic elements follow parallel lines.",
