      "question": "Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side profile of the grand piano shows a smooth, curved design that is typical of grand pianos, featuring a gentle arc and an elongated body. This is consistent with the common structure and aesthetic of grand pianos, which are designed to not only provide a certain acoustic quality but also to have a visually appealing design. By recognizing the characteristic shape, one can confirm that the curved side profile is indeed preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano is shown with distinct, tapered legs that have decorative casters at the bottom, positioned at each corner beneath the piano body. This is a typical setup for a grand piano, providing stability and a traditional aesthetic appearance. By observing these features, one can confirm that the piano in the edited image maintains this classic design element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the piano placed within a room with large windows, not within a corridor setting. There is no alignment with a vanishing point created by columns, as seen in a typical corridor environment. By observing the absence of such elements, it's clear that the positioning of the piano does not meet this criteria.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is comprised of large square tiles that have a uniform light shade rather than alternating dark and light colors. This consistent tile color does not support the pattern described in the question, which specifies alternation in shading.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the piano situated inside what appears to be a room with windows and marble-patterned walls, lacking any columnar structures that resemble a corridor. There are no tall columns creating a symmetrical passageway, hence the setting differs from that described in the question.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the piano retain a highly reflective, glossy black surface that mirrors the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano displays a glossy black finish typical of high-quality grand pianos, reflecting light and surrounding elements such as the windows and the marble walls. This shiny appearance ensures that the characteristic reflective surface is preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are soft shadows cast beneath the piano and along the floor, consistent with overhead lighting from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting within the room seems to be coming from the side windows rather than overhead, resulting in shadows that appear to complement this lighting direction. The shadows on the floor do appear soft but cannot be solely attributed to overhead lighting, indicating a different lighting setup.",
