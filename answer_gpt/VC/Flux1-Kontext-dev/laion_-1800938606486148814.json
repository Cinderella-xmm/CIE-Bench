      "question": "Is the Swoosh logo present in the same curved shape and located on the lateral side of the midsole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Swoosh logo is clearly visible, glowing in blue, and is positioned on the lateral side of the shoe's upper and overlaps with the midsole area. The curvature and orientation match typical designs seen on Nike sneakers. In Image A, the Swoosh is in solid black and similarly positioned, confirming the placement and style remain consistent. Common visual characteristics and brand design standards were used to determine this consistency.",
