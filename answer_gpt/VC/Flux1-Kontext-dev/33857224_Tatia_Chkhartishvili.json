      "question": "Are the boots rendered in bright red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain features boots that are a bright red color. This is clearly visible due to the uniform and vivid coloration typical of cartoon or chibi styles, where colors are often bold and exaggerated for effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress retain the visible openwork crochet pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress of the chibi keychain is depicted without any openwork crochet pattern. This simplified style is common in chibi designs, as details are often reduced to the essentials for clarity and simplicity. In contrast, Image A shows a dress with an intricate crochet pattern.",
      "weight": 3,

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are white socks visible beneath the red boots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain character shows white sections at the top of the boots, which are representative of socks. This is consistent with simple design animations where key features are emphasized through distinct sections of color.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the left boot does not show a small rectangular label. This is often omitted in simplified chibi or cartoon designs to maintain a streamlined look, whereas in Image A, such labels are present as part of the detailed, realistic representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a silver-colored buckle present on the upper part of the right boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a buckle on the upper part of the red boots, but it is not silver; it appears as a simple black line for outlining purposes. Chibi designs typically use minimal detail and often outline accessories without indicating precise material colors.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is designed bent forward at the waist, with hands positioned near the ankle area. This pose is maintained from Image A and often characterizes dynamic actions in both realistic and cartoon styles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the red boots extend below the hem of the white dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red boots do extend below the hem of the white dress in the chibi keychain design. This reflects the same fashion representation as in the original image, albeit in a simplified form.",
