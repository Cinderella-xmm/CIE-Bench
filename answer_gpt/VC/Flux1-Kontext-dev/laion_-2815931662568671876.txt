    "Question": "Q1: Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tortilla chips appear to be smooth with a cartoon-like appearance, lacking the detailed texture and visible salt crystals that would be expected from a coarse, slightly cracked texture. This suggests that the realistic elements have been replaced with stylized, simplified forms typical of cartoon imagery.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the golden-brown color of the largest tortilla chip preserved, with natural tonal variation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the coloring of the tortilla chip is uniform with a more illustrative style, lacking the nuanced tonal variation and golden-brown color that would suggest natural lighting and variation. This uniformity aligns with the stylized representation seen in animation or illustration.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the chunky, uneven texture of the guacamole mound preserved, showing visible avocado pieces?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict the guacamole mound with a realistic chunky texture or visible avocado pieces; instead, it features a character holding an avocado and a mound that appears more like smooth mashed potatoes, lacking detail and texture. This indicates a departure from photorealistic features to a more cartoonish aesthetic.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the green-yellow gradient of the guacamole preserved, showing natural avocado color variation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors associated with the guacamole and the avocado character are simplified and less gradient-driven, leaning into the solid colors typical in illustrations rather than the natural green-yellow gradient found in mashed avocado. This aligns with a cartoon form rather than a focus on natural color representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the chip and guacamole rendered with realistic material properties, avoiding glossy or plastic-like finishes?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays chips and guacamole with a glossy, plastic-like finish typical of animated scenes, differing from realistic material properties where textures and reflections mimic real-world counterparts. The edited aesthetic focuses on clean lines and simplified visuals, characteristic of animated properties rather than true-to-life representations.",
    "answer": "No"
