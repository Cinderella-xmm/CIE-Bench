      "question": "Is the glass still recognizable as a standard cocktail glass with a cylindrical shape and a flat base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure holding the beverage is not a typical glass but rather appears to be made of a clay or terracotta-like material, resembling a simple cylindrical cup. It does not look like a standard cocktail glass, as it lacks the clarity and typical flat base seen in standard glassware. This is inferred from the non-transparent appearance and bulkier, opaque material of the container.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible ice cubes in the glass, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible ice cubes in the container, which contribute to the impression that the beverage is chilled. This conclusion is drawn from the clear shapes resembling ice cubes, common knowledge about visually recognizing ice, and their typical inclusion in cold drinks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a slice of lime garnishing the rim of the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, there is a slice of lime placed on the rim of the container. The visual cue of the green and slightly curved object on the rim in Image B corresponds to the common appearance of a lime garnish in beverages.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a metallic straw inserted into the cocktail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a straw inserted into the drink, but it does not appear to be metallic as it is characterized by a non-reflective, matte surface more indicative of a plastic or paper straw. This interpretation is derived from comparing the visual look of metallic versus non-metallic materials.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface beneath the cocktail retain a polished wooden texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cocktail placed on a surface that does not exhibit a wooden texture; instead, it appears to be resting on a fabric napkin with buttons beside it, likely suggestive of a more decorative setting. This analysis is based on the visible attributes of texture and color differing from a polished wooden texture.",
