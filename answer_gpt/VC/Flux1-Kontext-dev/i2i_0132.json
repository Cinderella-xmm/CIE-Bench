      "question": "Is the frisbee visible in mid-air between the two individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frisbee is prominently positioned in the air between the two individuals. Its distinct shape and placement above the individuals' heads provide clear visual cues of a mid-air object, consistent with the appearance of a frisbee. This indicates that both individuals are engaged in an activity involving the frisbee. The image effectively captures a moment during a throw or catch sequence, further affirming the frisbee's position. Based on this visual analysis, we can confirm the frisbee is indeed in mid-air.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does one individual have their arm extended forward, as if throwing the frisbee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither individual has their arm extended in a manner that suggests throwing. Instead, both have their arms positioned with palms facing towards the frisbee, suggesting a catching action rather than a throwing motion. The stance and hand orientation of each person imply they are both in anticipation of receiving the frisbee, not propelling it forward. This analysis leads to the conclusion that no evident throwing motion is occurring.",

      "question": "Does the other individual have both hands raised, prepared to catch the frisbee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show one individual with both hands raised towards the frisbee. This posture, with hands somewhat opposed and lifted, is a typical position indicating readiness to catch an airborne object such as a frisbee. The individual's orientation and hand position resemble actions associated with catching, confirming their preparedness for receiving the frisbee as it descends.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Background analysis of Image B reveals numerous trees lining the setting behind the individuals. Their leafy appearance and placement create a typical park-like environment, enhancing the scene's outdoor activity ambiance. This backdrop effectively positions the individuals within a natural setting, thereby confirming the presence of trees visible behind them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire of both individuals in Image B comprises simple white shirts and casual jeans, which aligns with common casual wear rather than specialized sports attire. This choice of clothing, including the style and colors, signifies everyday leisure wear, suitable for informal outdoor activities. Their outfits' simplicity and lack of specific sporting elements affirm their casual nature.",
