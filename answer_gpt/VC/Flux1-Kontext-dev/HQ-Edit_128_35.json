      "question": "Is the curved carriage of the typewriter present and accurately shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter displays a distinct curved carriage, which is a characteristic feature of traditional typewriters. The carriage's curvature is evident, fitting seamlessly with the top section above the roller. My reasoning is based on the typical structure of vintage typewriters and the visual confirmation of its presence in the image.",

      "question": "Are the round silver key caps arranged in a QWERTY layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter shows round silver key caps. While the specific letters on each key are not clearly visible due to the image's resolution or angle, the arrangement appears to mimic a standard typewriter keyboard, which traditionally follows the QWERTY layout. Given this appearance and the common configuration for such machines, it is reasonable to conclude the layout is QWERTY.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"Underwood\" visible on the front panel of the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the front panel of the typewriter does not show any visible branding or engravings that identify it as 'Underwood'. Such brand names are typically found on the front or back of the typewriter, but no text resembling a brand name is clearly discernible in the provided image.",

      "question": "Is the radial fan-like pattern beneath the carriage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the carriage of the typewriter, a distinct radial, fan-like pattern is visible, which is typical of many vintage typewriters. This design element often houses parts of the typebar mechanism. The presence of this pattern is clear in the top section of the typewriter body.",

      "question": "Are the side knobs and left lever present on the typewriter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter has side knobs and a left lever, which are critical components for adjusting paper and spacing. These elements are visually identifiable and are consistent with standard design features of older typewriters, suggesting their presence is correct and accurately represented.",

      "question": "Is the typewriter body predominantly glossy black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the typewriter appears predominantly glossy black, characteristic of many traditional typewriters known for their enamel or polished finishes, which often reflect light. The shiny, reflective nature of the surface observed in the image supports this conclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, above the keyboard section, there is a visible cylindrical component consistent with a platen roller, typically present in typewriters for holding paper steady during typing. This feature is prominently situated above the keyboard, indicating the platen roller's presence.",
