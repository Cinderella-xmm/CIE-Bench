    "Question": "Q1: Is the vase's overall shape preserved, including its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is a clear glass vase with a simple, curvy shape. It lacks the ornate design elements such as a three-panel body or twin scrolled handles seen in the ornate, decorative vases, which can be observed from its transparent and minimalistic design. This suggests it does not maintain the features like scrolled handles and intricate panel designs typical in vases with such detailed embellishments.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet is neatly arranged within the glass vase, with the stems visible and positioned mostly upright. The flowers do not appear to extend significantly beyond the vase's rim to create an overflowing effect. This type of arrangement usually involves a more controlled, tidy composition which contrasts with bouquets that overflow beyond their container.",
