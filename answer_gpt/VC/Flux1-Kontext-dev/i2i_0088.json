      "question": "Is the napkin still dark blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the napkin is prominently featured and maintains a consistent dark blue color. The hue appears uniform and can be easily associated with common fabric colors used for napkins in formal settings. The deep blue tone is visually confirmed, matching traditional perceptions of dark blue in similar contexts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the napkin's fabric creases and texture preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a close inspection reveals the presence of fabric creases and texture. These creases help indicate the typical characteristics of cloth material, which often display natural folding and layering when positioned beneath objects such as cutlery. The image captures these details clearly, maintaining the authentic appearance of a cloth napkin.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the new spoon occupy the same position on the napkin as the original fork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, a fork is centrally aligned on top of a napkin. In Image B, the spoon appears to be placed similarly, positioned centrally over the napkin. Its placement mirrors that of the fork in the original image, suggesting intentional alignment and positional consistency between the two objects on the napkin.",

      "question": "Is the background still a solid dark blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B continues to demonstrate a solid dark blue tone, similar to Image A. This consistency in color forms a homogeneous setting across the image, providing a neutral backdrop with no variations in hue that might suggest otherwise.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and lighting on the spoon and napkin consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comparison between Images A and B, both images feature nuanced lighting that casts subtle shadows. The spoon in Image B exhibits light reflections and shadows that correspond with the fork's shadows in Image A. This consistency in lighting effects suggests uniformity in how light interacts with objects and their overlays (the napkin), supporting the perception of consistent lighting conditions across both images.",
