      "question": "Is the Fender logo visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar's headstock is visible and in a position where logos are usually placed on guitars. The Fender logo can be seen on the headstock based on its distinct cursive style. This conclusion is drawn from the placement and typical branding practices of guitar manufacturers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly six strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows six strings running across the guitar, which is standard for most acoustic guitars except for those designed with non-standard arrangements. The visual cues of the strings starting from the bridge and extending to the tuning pegs confirm this observation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a cutaway on the upper right side of the guitar body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the shape of the guitar in Image B, we see that the upper right side (from observable right when the guitar is held neck pointing left) does not have a cutaway. This conclusion is drawn by observing the design of the guitar body, which remains consistent in shape without alterations for easier access to higher frets.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the soundhole is located in the center of the guitar body relative to the width. This placement is standard for acoustic guitars to enhance sound resonance and tone.",

      "question": "Does the neck extend directly from the body to the headstock without significant deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized context, the guitar neck visually extends directly from the body to the headstock without any obvious curves or deviations. This is typical for acoustic guitars designed for standard playability.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the headstock with tuning pegs visible, three on each side, which is common with 6-string guitars. This symmetry assists in maintaining balance and ease of string tuning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the guitar body retain the classic dreadnought shape with a rounded lower bout and a cutaway on the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body maintains a classic rounded shape with a broad lower bout typical of dreadnought guitars. However, it lacks a cutaway on the upper right side; the entire body appears uniform without modifications for high-fret access.",
