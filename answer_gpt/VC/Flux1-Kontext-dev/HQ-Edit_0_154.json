      "question": "Is the U.S. $20 bill with its distinctive green color, \"20\" numeral, and architectural design visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graphical representation and labels suggest banknotes, but the specific markings and numeral '20' associated with the U.S. $20 bill are not distinct nor clearly visible. The representation focuses more on the concept of currency rather than specific details of each banknote.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the Qatari Riyal note with its pink-orange hue, Arabic script, and serial number \"103 01\" present and recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label in Image B points towards what should be the Qatari Riyal, but the visual depiction does not showcase specific details like the Arabic script or the serial number '103 01'. The general representation of currencies does not provide such detailed features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses generic diagrams and labels to represent various currencies but lacks the yellow-brown color and definitive symbols such as the lion capital which characterize the Indian Rupee 50 note. The notes are not depicted in any realistic detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of a U.S. banknote is implied by a label for USD, but the edited image does not include detailed elements like George Washington's portrait or the 'ONE DOLLAR' text that would confirm the presence of a U.S. $1 bill.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a diagram with labels to suggest various banknotes but does not visually depict specific notes and their unique details. Without explicit illustrations of these four specific notes in recognizable form, they are not all clearly present together.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a monochromatic and stylized illustration where the original colors of the currencies are not preserved. It relies on labels rather than color to denote different currencies.",
