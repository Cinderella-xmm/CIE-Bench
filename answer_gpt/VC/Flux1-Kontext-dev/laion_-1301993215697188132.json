      "question": "Is the blue herringbone-textured jacket retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features a cartoon owl wearing an outfit, but it does not seem consistent with a herringbone-textured jacket. In edited images like this, significant elements such as clothing patterns are subject to change, and the cartoon style often simplifies textures.",
      "weight": 3,

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the collar and lapel shape of the blue jacket preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a cartoon owl, which typically does not include realistic or detailed clothing features such as collar and lapel shapes. Cartoon representations tend to simplify or stylize these elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are two microphones visible in front of the speaker in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited cartoon representation, the abstraction or omission of elements such as microphones is common. Usually, cartoons do not focus on minor details of real settings such as microphones.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the speakerâ€™s right hand raised with an open palm in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a cartoon owl with raised wing-like arms slightly different from the actual human hand gesture. The simplification in cartoons often alters the specifics of human gestures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, which is a cartoon representation featuring an owl and contextual graphic design, does not depict the emblem typical of podium settings such as those seen in formal presentations or speeches.",
