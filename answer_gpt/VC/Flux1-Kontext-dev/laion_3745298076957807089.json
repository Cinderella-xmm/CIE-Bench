    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bottle’s main body still a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle clearly maintains a transparent rectangular glass design with smoothly rounded edges. The visual cues such as the reflection and liquid clarity confirm its transparency and rectangular shape. Common knowledge of bottle designs supports that the softly rounded edges are often implemented to avoid harsh angles and provide a smoother profile.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the interior of the bottle filled with a golden-yellow translucent liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is indeed filled with a golden-yellow liquid, as observed from its color and the light passing through it, giving it a translucent appearance. Common knowledge suggests that this color is typical for liquids such as whiskey or similar concoctions, reinforcing the perception based on the filtered lighting seen in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black box with the arched cutout and gold text \"CADENHEAD'S\" at the top and \"ESTD. 1842\" at the bottom still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box retains the essential characteristics of an arched cutout and gold lettering for 'CADENHEAD'S' at the top and 'ESTD. 1842' at the bottom, suggesting its continuity from Image A. Our knowledge of product packaging highlights that such details are often maintained for branding purposes and product recognition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible reflections and highlights on the glass surface of the bottle indicating transparency and smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits reflections and highlights on the bottle's surface, suggesting both its transparency and its smooth structure. Reflections are typical of transparent glass surfaces due to the interaction of light with the material, reinforcing the visual observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the box, with the box’s arched window aligned to frame the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottle positioned to the left of the box, and the box’s arched window is aligned to frame the bottle. This alignment is common for product displays, enhancing the presentation by drawing focus to the main item through framing.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bottle have a flat, thickened base that rests stably on the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B has a visually thickened base, indicative of stability typically required for such containers. The visual cues from the bottom of the bottle, which sits flatly on the surface, demonstrate this feature. Bottles are often designed this way to prevent tipping and ensure proper balancing.",
