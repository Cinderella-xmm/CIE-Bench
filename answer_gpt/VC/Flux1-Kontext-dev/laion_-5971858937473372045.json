      "question": "Are there exactly three women in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual composition shows three distinct women standing in a group. This can be identified by the presence of three separate bodies wearing distinct dresses, each holding a bouquet. The setting looks like a classic arrangement for a bridal or ceremonial photo, which typically involves groups and aligns with the presence of three individuals. The dresses and bouquets further support the ceremonial context, making it a common occurrence to feature three women in such images.",

      "question": "Is the central woman positioned directly between the other two women?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central positioning is discerned by observing the spatial arrangement of the women. The middle woman stands equidistantly between the other two, a standard arrangement for photographs of this nature. Such a triadic setup is symmetrical, where the central figure is a focal point, commonly the case in event photography to emphasize the primary individual.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all three women hold bouquets in front of their bodies with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows each woman holding a bouquet of flowers directly in front of them with both hands. This arrangement is typical for maintaining symmetry and balance in ceremonial group photographs, often seen at weddings where such poses are standard practice.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all three women facing directly toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the women's bodies and the alignment of the bouquets suggest that they are facing towards the camera directly. This stance is characteristic of formal group photos where the subjects are expected to face the photographer to ensure their presence is captured clearly.",

      "question": "Are all three women standing upright with full body visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all three women are indeed standing upright and their full bodies are visible within the frame. The long dresses and the way they're positioned support the idea that this photo captures them fully rather than cutting off any crucial elements, as is typical in full-body event photography.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any facial expressions visibly due to the blurred section. Normally, this question could have been answered by observing the facial expressions, but given the current image edit, this cannot be specifically determined.",
