      "question": "Is the infinity pool's edge still visible and defining the boundary between the water and the surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no real pool visible; instead, a stone relief design is present. Since Image B has transformed the scene into a carved stone relief, typical elements such as the infinity pool edge, which was clearly visible in Image A defining the water's boundary, seem to be nonexistent in the relief context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman still positioned centrally in the pool, maintaining her original orientation relative to the pool's edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is now a stone relief rendering of a woman rather than a real photograph. The woman's position cannot be directly compared to the pool's real positioning as in Image A, and as such, she is not centrally positioned in a realistic pool or maintaining an orientation relative to the pool's edge.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the traditional-style buildings with tiered roofs still visible in the background, integrated into the stone relief design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the artwork of Image B, while it maintains a thematic consistency in the inclusion of certain elements like the carved structures resembling traditional buildings, it's different from the natural setting of Image A. Therefore, the tiered roofs are reimagined as part of the stone relief design, with visible integration of similar styled structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dense tropical foliage, including palm trees, still present in the background, albeit reimagined as part of the stone relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a creative representation in which elements like foliage are recreated in a stone relief format. Although these elements cannot be expected to retain their natural form as seen in Image A, they appear to have been reimagined as engravings or carvings within the stone relief.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scene retain a bright and clear lighting effect, consistent with the original sunny day atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the transformation to a stone relief, Image B is captured under bright natural sunlight, as evident from the clear shadows and bright highlights on the stone surface, similar to the sunny conditions observed in Image A.",
