      "question": "Is the white rectangular signboard with the black kanji \"どぜう\" present above the entrance of the traditional building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the focus is on determining the presence of the specific signboard with Japanese writing. Image B shows a futuristic large robot dominating the scene, disallowing clear visibility of traditional building details including signboards. The head and upper body of the robot obscure the potential position of a building entrance signboard. Therefore, based on Image B alone, the signboard with the kanji 'どぜう' is not observed.",

      "question": "Is the vertical white sign with black Japanese text \"うちおぎ 仮四宿\" mounted on the left side of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B must be scanned carefully for any sidelining elements, such as vertical text signs, on buildings. The enormous robot conceals much of the background, including buildings and any signs they might have, leading to an absence of visibility for such details. Consequently, in Image B, this specific vertical sign 'うちおぎ 仮四宿' is not visible.",

      "question": "Is the tall wooden utility pole with multiple wires and attached streetlights visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the context of Image B which displays a giant robot amidst urban structures, it alters or hides distinguishing elements like utility poles. The scene is dominated by modern and fantastical imagery, showing no tall wooden utility poles with streetlights, typically found in regular environments. Hence, such a pole is absent in the futuristic context of Image B.",

      "question": "Are white zebra crossing stripes visible on the road surface in front of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's largely occupied foreground by the giant robot and urban road elements should typically produce road features like zebra crossings. However, the emphasis on the robot and altered proportions obscure street details such as zebra crossings, which are integral in a regular setting. Therefore, these stripes are not visible in this composition.",

      "question": "Is a bicycle parked on the sidewalk near the right edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the fantastical setup of Image B with a massive robot in an urban setting, smaller everyday items like a parked bicycle get overshadowed or hidden by the grandeur and clutter. Searching the sides of Image B doesn't reveal any visible bikes, so such an element is not present.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dark doorway with hanging curtains visible at the center of the building’s ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visibility of entrances in traditional buildings, often characterized by dark doorways and hanging curtains, is checked in Image B. But the giant robot overshadows immediate building specifics, negating clear discernment of such features like a curtained doorway in the ground level. Thus, this detail isn't seen.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there horizontal wooden lattices visible on the upper level of the building’s façade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although traditional buildings frequently feature wooden lattices, Image B’s prominent futuristic elements supersede intricate architectural components like lattices on building façades. The image's central focus offsets attention or availability to such styled features. Therefore, such lattices are absent from detailed observation.",

      "question": "Is the traditional building positioned in front of the tall white skyscraper, creating a layered depth effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is examined for a setting where a traditional building might stand in front of a skyscraper to evoke a depth illusion. This image's central element, a towering robot, blocks layered depth by obscuring a clear view of buildings that typically include distance contrasts. Therefore, a semblance of layered depth with a traditional building in front of a skyscraper is not achieved.",
