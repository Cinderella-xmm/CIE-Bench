      "question": "Are the bright red flowers in the lower-left foreground still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower-left foreground contains bright red flowers nestled among green leaves. These flowers look consistent with those typically seen in dense tropical regions, providing a natural and vibrant color contrast to the rest of the scene's greenery. Since they are clearly visible in the foreground, it can be concluded that the bright red flowers are still present.",

      "question": "Is the large green leaf in the bottom-right corner still visible and in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a prominent large green leaf in the bottom-right corner, which is similar in position and scale to the leaf seen in Image A. The leaf's visibility and placement indicate that it remains unchanged in Image B compared to Image A.",

      "question": "Are the palm-like fronds with fan-shaped leaves visible on the right side of the waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall is flanked by tropical vegetation, including fan-shaped leaves that resemble palm fronds. These leaves maintain the overall tropical aesthetic of the scene and are visible on the right side in both images, indicating they are still present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the moss-covered rock formation visible at the top of the waterfallâ€™s origin point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the top of the waterfall appears to originate from a rugged rock formation. Though the exact texture, such as moss coverage, may not be as emphasized or clearly visible as in Image A, the rock formation is still a notable part of the waterfall's origin point in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the dense tropical vegetation on both sides of the waterfall still present and forming a natural frame around the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the lush vegetation seen in Image A, with dense foliage on both sides of the waterfall. This vegetation acts as a natural frame, encapsulating the scene and emphasizing the waterfall as a focal point. The dense greenery remains a prominent feature in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the pool area at the base of the waterfall still located in the same position, even if its appearance has changed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pool area at the base of the waterfall in Image B hosts a transformed or enhanced visual, but the location and positioning remain consistent with Image A. This suggests that while the appearance of the pool has changed, possibly due to artistic additions, its position remains constant.",
