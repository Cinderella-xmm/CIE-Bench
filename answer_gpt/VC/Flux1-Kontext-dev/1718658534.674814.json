      "question": "Is the dorsal ridge composed of a series of raised, looped structures running along the back of the pig?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative orange pig with a series of clearly defined, raised structures resembling loops running along its back. These features are prominently visible due to the contrast against the smooth, reflective surface of the pig, which helps to highlight the looped design. This observation combined with the common design elements of ornamental pigs suggests that the ridge is indeed composed of looped structures.",

      "question": "Does the tail extend from the rear of the pig and terminate in a fluffy pom-pom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail is visibly extending from the rear of the decorative pig and terminates in what resembles a fluffy pom-pom. The visual structure of the end of the tail simulates a pom-pom, showing a bunch of loose, decorative strands that mimic the fluffy appearance of such an object.",

      "question": "Are there four short legs attached beneath the body, two on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pig depicted in Image B clearly displays four short legs attached evenly beneath its body, with two positioned on each side. This is typically a design choice in such ornamental figures and helps provide stability and support for the pig when placed on a surface, thus confirming the existence of four legs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a pig with a distinctly rounded snout extending forward from its face, characteristic of pig designs and contributing to the overall aesthetic appeal. The bulbous shape is a classic representation found in ornamental and toy pig designs, supporting the conclusion that the snout is indeed rounded.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pig in Image B has a pair of small ears positioned on top of its head. These ears are slightly raised, thus appearing upright, which is a typical characteristic seen in pigs and similar decorative objects to convey cuteness and detail in design.",
