    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible red flower-like motif present in the central area of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed object resembles an egg with intricate designs on its surface. There is a motif prominently featuring a red flower located in the central area of this object. This conclusion is drawn from the clear appearance of petals and a central structure typically seen in floral designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a continuous blue geometric pattern forming a border near the upper edge of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a phoenix egg with complex patterns. Near the upper edge, the design includes multiple geometric elements and colors, but a dominant, continuous blue geometric pattern specifically forming an upper border is not visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there green leaf-like shapes integrated into the surface design of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design on the surface of the phoenix egg in Image B includes green shapes that resemble leaves, integrated as part of the intricate, floral and natural pattern. This observation is made by identifying typical leaf-like structures within the artwork, considering color and shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the patterns outlined in black to define individual elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a colorful and detailed design on the surface of the egg, where many of the elements, such as flowers and leaves, appear to be outlined with black to distinguish individual components, making the design clear and well-defined.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pattern arrangement radially symmetric around the center of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the designs on the phoenix egg do not appear to be arranged in a radially symmetric manner around any central point, as there is a more complex arrangement of motifs without a clear radial symmetry. Radial symmetry would imply equidistant, repetitive patterns from a center point, which is not observed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors blue, red, green, and black used throughout the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the phoenix egg in Image B prominently features a combination of colors including blue, red, green, and black across its patterns, which are the dominant colors observed in the design. Each color plays a significant role in the details and motifs present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the transformed cup (now phoenix egg) positioned within or upon the transformed saucer (now nest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed phoenix egg is visibly positioned upon a transformed saucer, which resembles a nest. The egg sits clearly within the nest-like structure, depicting a traditional placement of an object on a saucer, now styled as a nest.",
