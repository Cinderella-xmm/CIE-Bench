      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original woman’s facial features, including the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's facial features are entirely obscured due to blur effects. Therefore, specific facial details like the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline are not visible at all.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original woman’s skin tone preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features the woman's face entirely blurred, which obscures her skin tone. The visible portions of skin tone in the edited image appear different compared to the unedited visual cues from Image A due to the artistic style, lighting, and details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the walking posture with the left leg forward and the right arm bent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is standing still with both arms at her sides rather than walking. The posture differs from Image A's walking motion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the woman's hands are posed differently than in Image A. She holds a fan with one hand, suggesting a static pose rather than having one hand extended forward and the other near the hip.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the face being blurred in the edited image, the gaze direction cannot be determined. Therefore, the implication of direct gaze towards the camera, which is visible in Image A, isn't preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the original volume and curl pattern of the woman’s hair preserved, even if partially obscured or styled differently?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a similar volume and curl pattern of hair, indicating that this aspect is preserved despite the different styling due to the outfit change.",
