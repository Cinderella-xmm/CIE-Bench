      "question": "Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure standing seems to be an elderly person, not a bear. There is no visible bear with a muscular build or shape, hence the context doesn't relate to bear anatomy.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a cartoonish scene, and there's no depiction of a bear or any detailed fur rendering that shows texture or shading as in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The salmon in Image B is depicted as a simplified cartoon with a single orange color, differing from Image A’s realistic color scheme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't depict a bear with water during any interaction; it's primarily focused on a cartoon-like narrative.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a human figure rather than a bear, so the specific features of a bear's snout and muzzle are irrelevant and not depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B lacks the realism or dynamic positioning illustrating a bear with salmon, unlike what is detailed in Image A, where the salmon's natural pose is depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
