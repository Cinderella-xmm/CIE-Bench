      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped with a grayish-blue iris and visible upper and lower eyelashes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the eyes should be is blurred. Without visual access to these details, we cannot determine the shape, color, or presence of eyelashes. Common knowledge about chibi or cartoon figures suggests simplified facial features which often do not include detailed eyes similar to realistic irises, but the blur prevents even this assessment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a receding hairline with thin, light gray hair present only on the sides and back of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle is very different from a receding hairline with thin, light gray hair as it depicts a cartoonish figure with distinct, stylized brown hair, covering the whole head including the top. This suggests a non-realistic portrayal, typical of chibi or cartoon-style designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shirt have thin vertical red and white stripes running along the collar and down the placket on a dark blue background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt features bold, colorful stripes with a combination of pink, blue, and yellow colors. There are hearts along the collar, and the stripes are not thin red and white ones as described. It showcases a playful and vivid style typical of cartoon designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible white button at the top of the shirtâ€™s placket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt has buttons in the same vivid color scheme as the rest of the shirt. A white button at the top is not visible, which matches with the overall design choice of using bold colors, and has no white elements in that area.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gray blazer have a notched lapel with a defined edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is wearing a colorful shirt without any blazer. The style moves away from realistic attire including jackets or blazers and focuses on simplified, yet bold clothing patterns, typical of non-realist cartoon styles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are fine lines visible around the eyes and forehead, and is the skin texture subtly detailed with pores?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style adheres to a smooth, uniform surface often associated with cartoon or animated characters, lacking any fine lines or detailed skin textures like pores. This correlates with a stylized, simplified approach to character design where intricate skin details are usually absent.",
