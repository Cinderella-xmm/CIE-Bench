      "question": "Is the central positioning and rectangular shape of the light blue sofa retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light blue sofa is still centrally positioned in the room, maintaining its rectangular shape. The edited image utilizes a stylized filter, which alters the texture but not the basic positioning and shape of objects. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the central positioning and rectangular shape of the sofa are retained as they are consistent with its appearance in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the framed landscape painting above the sofa still present in its original rectangular proportions and central alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the framed painting above the sofa remains in its rectangular proportions and central alignment relative to the sofa, similar to its position in Image A. Despite the stylized filter used in the edited image, no changes to the basic characteristics or alignment of the painting are evident. The painting's rectangular shape and positioning continue to correspond to Image A's setup.",

      "question": "Are the large green leaves of the plant on the left side of the sofa preserved in terms of shape and location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the large green leaves of the plant to the left of the sofa in the same location as Image A. The stylization in the edited image affects the texture and visual detail, but not the shape or positioning of the leaves. The leaves continue to exhibit a large, elongated shape consistent with Image A's depiction.",

      "question": "Is the blue-based lamp with the white shade positioned on the table to the right of the sofa preserved in terms of shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the blue-based lamp with the white shade on the table right of the sofa retains its position and shape as seen in Image A. Although the texture appears altered due to the editing effect, the lamp's shape and position beside the sofa remain unchanged, suggesting the object's preservation across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light-colored rug beneath the sofa is visible in Image B, similar to Image A. Despite the application of the artistic filter, the rug is preserved in terms of presence and location, which can be deduced by looking at visual cues in the edited image where the floor texture suggests continuity.",
