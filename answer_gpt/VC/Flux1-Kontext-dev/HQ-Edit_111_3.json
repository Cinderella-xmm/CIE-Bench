      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original iridescent electric blue wing color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings are still the same iridescent electric blue as observed in Image A. This is evident from the consistent coloration visible across the surface of the butterfly's wings, which retains a vibrant electric blue shade that can be associated with the original depiction. The editing has not altered this particular feature of the butterfly, which is its distinct and striking blue color.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dark black edges along the outer margins of the butterflyâ€™s wings preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly still exhibits the dark black edging along the perimeter of its wings. This is a characteristic feature that outlines the blue wing surface and adds contrast, enhancing the visual distinction and structure of the butterfly's wings. A careful observation confirms that this detail remains intact in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted with both wings fully extended and symmetrically open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is shown with its wings fully extended and symmetrically open, consistent with Image A. The butterfly's body acts as a centerline, with its wings spreading out evenly on either side, which is typical for butterflies at rest or when displaying their wings in full span.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bright pink cosmos flower directly beneath the butterfly still present and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bright pink cosmos flower is still present and clearly visible in Image B, just as it is in Image A. Its vibrant color remains a focal element beneath the butterfly, supporting the composition where the butterfly is centrally placed and in close proximity to this particular flower, allowing it to remain an important part of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the yellow stamens forming the central disc of the pink flower visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow stamens are clearly visible forming the central disc of the pink flower, consistent with Image A. This central disc with its stamens is a distinct feature of cosmos flowers, standing out against the petal background, which remains unchanged in the edited version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the butterfly physically touching the surface of the pink flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is not physically touching the surface of the pink flower; instead, it appears to hover above the flower. The visual cues show a slight separation between the lower part of the butterfly and the flower's petals, indicating no contact.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are multiple unopened pink flower buds visible around the main flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to display multiple unopened pink flower buds surrounding the central cosmos flower, similar to Image A. These buds contribute to the natural garden setting and serve to complement the main flower in the composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B retains the softly blurred green leaves as seen in Image A, establishing a natural garden ambiance with its smooth and non-distracting backdrop. This technique enhances the focus on the butterfly and the nearby flowers, providing a serene and cohesive visual setting.",
