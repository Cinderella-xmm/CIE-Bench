      "question": "Does the edited image retain the metallic base of the lantern with visible engraved and perforated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic base of the lantern is clearly visible and retains its engraved and perforated patterns. This can be confirmed by examining the details of the base which shows similar design elements to traditional lantern bases, including cutouts and decorative engravings that suggest an ornate craftsmanship similar to the original image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the stained-glass body of the lantern with clearly visible colored segments in red, green, blue, and orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass body of the lantern distinctly shows colored segments that are red, green, blue, and orange. These colors are clear and easily discernible, indicating that the edited image has retained the same color palette as seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured honeycomb-like internal surface of the glass body that produces a warm, diffused glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, showcases the glass body's internal texture that resembles a honeycomb design. This texture diffuses light to produce a warm glow, which is evident from the visual characteristics of the lantern itself, similar to the glowing effect observed in the original image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern features a finial with a tiered shape topped with a small loop, consistent with the design found in the original image. This suggests that this specific design element has been retained in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the lantern emitting a warm, internal glow from within the glass body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, exhibits the lantern emitting a warm glow from within the glass body. This characteristic is visible as it illuminates the colored segments noticeably, contributing to the warmth similar to the atmosphere created by the lantern in the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the overall silhouette of the lantern as a bulbous glass body on a flared metal base topped with a conical finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lantern with a bulbous glass body atop a flared metal base and concluding with a tiered conical finial has been preserved. This observation can be verified by comparing the general shape and structural outline to that seen in Image A, showing consistency in the lantern's profile.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain geometric Islamic design motifs (such as stars, diamonds, or interlocking patterns) in the surrounding environment, even if scaled down or adapted into streets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are signs of scaled-down geometric motifs, particularly on the base under the glass dome with the lantern, which reflect Islamic design patterns like stars and interlocking shapes. While these motifs are not explicitly adapted into streets, the influence is discernible through the decorative elements depicted in the edited image.",
