      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not show a red train and metallic fence. Instead, it features a simple, solid blue background with no indication of any train or fence structures. This shows a clear deviation from a complex train station setting, characteristic of an edited cartoon image rather than a real-world scene.",

      "question": "Does the worker still wear the neon yellow vest with orange reflective stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon elephant wearing a yellow T-shirt with an orange vest over it. This vest does have reflective gray stripes that are similar in style to safety vests worn by workers in the field. This reflects an attempt to replicate the worker's attire from a practical standpoint, though it is in an animated format.",

      "question": "Is the worker still holding the phone up to their ear in the same posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has neither a phone in hand nor is it in a posture that suggests it is holding a phone to its ear. Instead, the cartoon character’s posture is cheerful and open-armed as part of its friendly animated design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted wearing an orange safety helmet, suggesting a transformation in style rather than a direct preservation of elements such as a yellow hard hat from the worker’s original wardrobe. The change may be influenced by artistic preference as the hard hat color has transformed to align with the character’s creative portrayal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower attire is represented as gray elephant legs showing no vibrant differentiation correlating to green shorts and orange pants. This absence demonstrates a shift from detailed clothing elements consistent with real-world uniforms. The design choice is simplified for the cartoon style, where clothing cues common in real-world uniforms are not maintained.",
