    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the elderly man’s deeply wrinkled facial features, including the pronounced vertical lines on the forehead and crow’s feet around the eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's face is blurred, making it impossible to assess the presence or absence of deeply wrinkled facial features such as pronounced vertical lines on the forehead and crow's feet around the eyes. Since these details are obscured, we cannot confirm their presence in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the saxophone still present and held in the same manner, with the player’s left hand on the keys and the mouthpiece touching the lips?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the musical instrument appears to be an oboe rather than a saxophone, and the man is holding it at an angle where the mouthpiece does not visibly touch the lips due to blurring. The hand positioning can be seen, but since the instrument is different, the action does not match a traditional saxophone grip.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the two glasses and the brown bottle still placed on the table in front of the musician, with one glass partially full and the other empty?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table in front of the musician still has two glasses and a brown bottle. However, it's observed that one glass is partially full while the presence of an empty glass is not evident due to the viewing angle and lighting. This arrangement seems consistent with the question’s details.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the dark wooden tabletop still visible with subtle reflections of the glasses and bottle?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a dark wooden tabletop with the presence of reflections from the glasses and bottle, indicating a polished surface that catches light similarly to Image A. This suggests that the tabletop characteristics have been retained.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the primary light source still positioned above and behind the subject, casting shadows on the left side of his face?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, it is evident that the primary light source is still above and behind the subject. This is deduced by observing the lighting on the man's clothing and the environment, which casts shadows that indicate a similar light direction to that of Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the musician’s hands positioned correctly on the saxophone, with the left hand supporting the lower section and the right hand pressing the keys?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the musician holds an instrument that resembles an oboe rather than a saxophone, with hand positioning atypical for a saxophone. The left hand gripping a higher section and the right hand on keys appears consistent, but the context of the instrument means it does not match the traditional saxophone grip.",
    "answer": "No"
