      "question": "Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bulb is depicted in an illustrative style, maintaining the teardrop shape that is typically seen in Edison-style bulbs. The internal filaments are drawn with clear lines to mimic the real-life appearance of such bulbs, maintaining the filament-like texture. This imagery is represented in the comic format within Image B, reflecting world knowledge of how these bulbs traditionally look.",

      "question": "Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows curved vertical lines surrounding the bulb, mimicking the real-life feature of many pendant light fixtures where metal bars encase the bulb in a cage-like structure. In the comic-style drawing, these bars are exaggerated to emphasize the design element, conveying the cage aspect that is common in industrial or vintage lighting fixtures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the bulb structure illustrates a cylindrical housing that resembles the real-world feature found in pendant lights. The comic-style emphasizes simplified details of the housing, but the screw detail is visually identifiable, aligning with the common knowledge of how the fixture typically appears in metal lighting designs.",

      "question": "Is the circular cap at the bottom of the metal cage present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic-style depiction includes a rounded element at the base of the cage structure, indicative of a circular cap. This aligns with the common design feature found in pendant lighting where a cap or closure element is present at the bottom to hold the cage structure together.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic representation positions the glass bulb at the center of the metal bars, typical of such designs where the bulb is enveloped centrally by the cage structure for both aesthetic balance and functional lighting distribution.",
