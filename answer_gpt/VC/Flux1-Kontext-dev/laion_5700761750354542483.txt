    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?",
    "explanation": "Based on the edited image, the butterfly structure includes a visible contrast area that suggests the presence of four wings in a typical arrangement. The shape indicates two larger upper wings and two smaller lower wings, which is a common morphological characteristic for butterflies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?",
    "explanation": "The visible structure in the edited image seems to retain symmetry, which is a natural and common feature among butterflies where both sides tend to mirror each other to aid in balance and aerodynamic functionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the likelihood of a central body connecting the wings is high as it is consistent with insect anatomy, particularly in butterflies where wings emanate symmetrically from a central body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?",
    "explanation": "Butterfly designs frequently include embellishments or practical features like a loop for hanging. Despite the blurriness, the top of the head region might possess such a feature as a common design element for decorative purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?",
    "explanation": "The edited image suggests a position where the wings are likely displayed spread out in a plane consistent with traditional butterfly presentation, often done to exhibit the wing pattern or decorations fully.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?",
    "explanation": "Generally, butterfly wings are designed to be larger than their body for flight efficiency and aesthetic design balance. The edited image retains this common proportion where the wings dominate the visual space.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?",
    "explanation": "The visual idea of butterfly upper wings having pointed tips and a curved edge aligns with the natural morphology favored for aerodynamics and aesthetic appeal. Even in blurred imagery, the silhouette can suggest those shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?",
    "explanation": "Lower butterfly wings are typically smaller and rounder, a design replicated in many decorative items to maintain biological accuracy. Despite the blur, this structural hierarchy is likely preserved in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
