      "question": "Is the mango depicted with an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is represented with a geometric shape that appears elongated vertically, consistent with an oval form. The edges are rounded, typical of an oval, and this interpretation is confirmed by the visual cue of continuity in the curve without sharp angles. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mango is depicted with an oval shape.",

      "question": "Is there a small stem visible at the top of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a small protrusion at the top part of the mango is visually detected. This feature is recognized as a stem based on its placement and relative size compared to the mango, aligning with common knowledge of how a mango's stem typically appears.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper towel folded into a cradle-like shape beneath the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paper towel is arranged in a way that supports the mango, with multiple folds surrounding it in an upward arch. Such an arrangement forms a cradle-like shape, which is characterized by the towelâ€™s edges lifting and curving upwards to contain the mango.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four clearly defined flaps extending from the paper towel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct extensions of the paper towel, appearing as four individual segments protruding outward from the mango. These segments resemble flaps and are distinguished by their separation and bending at the edges, a typical characteristic for describing defined flaps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mango positioned in the center of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the mango appears more towards one side of the table rather than centrally located. The visual proportions and alignment against the table's visible edges suggest that it is not centered, as more space is observed on one side.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the table show a horizontal wood grain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table's surface is depicted with lines running parallel to the bottom edge of the image, reminiscent of a horizontal wood grain pattern. These lines are consistent in texture and appearance with how wood grain is typically represented in art and other imagery.",

      "question": "Is a wooden chair partially visible behind the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a segment resembling the backrest of a wooden chair, identifiable by its rectangular shape and color consistency with wooden materials. It is positioned behind where the table is assumed to be, indicating partial visibility of a chair.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a diagonal shadow cast by the mango onto the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beside the mango, there is a visible darkened shape on the table surface originating from the mango and extending outwards at an angle. This area is darker than the surrounding table, indicating it's a shadow, and its alignment suggests a diagonal direction.",
