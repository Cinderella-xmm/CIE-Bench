        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there is a clear depiction of a road-like structure that runs parallel and extends into the distance, serving as a central axis in the composition. The road is characterized by its linear perspective, drawing the viewer's eye toward the horizon. The visual component of the road is prominent, as it is central to the image's layout.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars that resemble telephone poles positioned along the right side of the road. These structures contribute to the composition's balance and provide an additional element of perspective along with the road. Their presence is evident from the distinct geometric shapes in the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
