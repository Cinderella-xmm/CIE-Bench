      "question": "Is the pink candle in the gold holder still present directly behind the central platter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a cartoon-style scene with anthropomorphic characters and lacks detailed objects seen in Image A. There is no evidence of a pink candle in a gold holder directly behind the central platter in this cartoon illustration. This suggests that this specific element is not present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon depiction and doesn't feature the realistic and detailed elements found in Image A. There are no evergreen pine branches forming a semi-circular frame around the central platter in this illustration, as the style focuses on simplified visuals without detailed natural elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cartoonish scene and it lacks realistic depiction of holiday decorations like a red poinsettia with gold tinsel and star-patterned ribbon at the top center. This indicates such an element is absent in the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon and does not showcase detailed place settings with the same specificity as in Image A. There are no visible white plates, yellow napkins, or silverware evenly distributed around the central platter, suggesting this configuration is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a cartoon style that omits many of the realistic dining elements like clear wine glasses with visible liquid reflections. This absence of such specific detailing implies that these items are not part of the cartoon scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon representation of Image B, detailed holiday decorations like red baubles and woven ball decorations are missing. Instead, it showcases simplified and stylized illustrations, eliminating such specific details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon drawing retains a stylized version of the chicken on a platter with green lettuce leaves and red cherry tomatoes, which is directly influenced by the realistic setup in Image A but presented in a simplified artistic interpretation.",
