        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no direct representation of bananas. The image is a simplified graphic illustration featuring a house-like structure, a vehicle, and colored shapes that seem to represent land and water. There are no realistic objects like bananas portrayed in their curved shape and brown-spotted texture that are often present in the real world. Image B does not display any natural or life-like elements similar to bananas, which are commonly recognized by their yellow color and spotted texture based on visual cues and world knowledge.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

There is no evidence of a kitchen mixer or any kitchen appliance found typically in culinary settings like those identified in Image A. The visualization in Image B does not accommodate for any kitchen appliances such as those observed in real-world scenarios.",
