      "question": "Does the dog retain its white fur color and sharp, upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, the dog clearly has white fur and upright ears. This conclusion is drawn from the visible parts of the dog that remain unchanged in color and structure from Image A to Image B. The white fur and sharp, upright ears are evident characteristics of the dog.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though the face is blurred, the dog's mouth is open, as indicated by the position and shape of the muzzle, confirming that its teeth and tongue are visible. This observation is made by recognizing the typical appearance of a dog in motion with an open mouth, similar to Image A.",

      "question": "Does the dog wear a red collar around its neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a red collar around the dog's neck is clearly visible despite the blur added to the face. This matches the detail of the red collar seen in Image A, confirming the dog's accessory remains consistent before and after editing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's posture and the direction of its legs indicate it is moving towards the camera. The forward motion is apparent from the dog's positioning and dynamic posture, similar to the original directional indication in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting includes visible grass in the foreground and blurred trees in the background, consistent with a park-like setting. This observation matches Image A, which also features the same outdoor environment, ensuring the scene context remains unchanged.",
