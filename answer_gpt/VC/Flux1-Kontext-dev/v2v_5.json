      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's posture indicates it is leaning forward, as its head is close to the cake. This forward-leaning stance suggests an interest in the cake, possibly due to curiosity or food-related instincts. The proximity of the zebra's head to the cake further supports this observation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake features a single lit candle. This is identified by the presence of a single candle on the top of the cake with a visible flame, which indicates it is lit. This single-candle arrangement is often used to signify celebrations or special occasions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is positioned on what appears to be a flat surface, resembling a table. The visual cues, such as the horizontal surface under the cake, support the interpretation that it is placed on a table, providing stability and suggesting a typical serving arrangement.",
