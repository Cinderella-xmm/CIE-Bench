      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a surreal scene on a floating island in the sky. The central feature is a large apple atop a small structure surrounded by flowers and mini creatures like ants and a beetle. This scene does not contain any umbrellas, whether open or closed, nor does it depict any components such as radial ribs converging at a central hub, which are typical characteristics of an umbrella. Thus, based on the visual cues and world knowledge, Image B does not include any object resembling an umbrella.",

      "question": "Is the closed umbrella present with a black casing, wrist strap, and metallic tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we see an imaginative illustration with an apple, insects, and flowers on a floating landmass under a moonlit sky. The image lacks any depiction of a closed umbrella or related elements like a black casing, wrist strap, or metallic tip. Hence, with the absence of any closed umbrella elements, the closed umbrella is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the starlit sky with visible stars and nebulae still present as the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a vibrant night sky that includes a large and clear depiction of the moon surrounded by stars, but it does not explicitly include any nebulae as seen in some astronomical images. The sky serves as the backdrop for the floating island scene. While there are stars and a celestial ambiance, the term 'nebulae' does not fully apply to this starry sky depiction. However, as stars are visible and prominent, we can affirm the presence of a starlit sky.",

      "question": "Is the scene composed with flowers in the foreground, a hill in the midground, and the sky in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is composed of a floating piece of land with flowers scattered around. An apple and a small structure are depicted in the middle area, creating a central composition rather than a hill. The sky with stars and the moon completes the background. Though the flowers are in the foreground as specified, the absence of a hill shifts the midground description away from typical landscape scenes. Therefore, it cannot be described as having a hill in the midground.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork does not include any depiction of an umbrella or similar structure with a canopy and support ribs. The illustration is focused on an imaginative floating landmass with a large apple and flowers, devoid of any umbrella mechanisms. Without any black support ribs extending from a central hub, it is clear that no such structures are present in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a variety of flowers in the landscape surrounding the apple structure. While it contains multiple flowers, the visual appearance and style are artistic and don't explicitly replicate specific botanical species such as yellow coneflowers and red poppies, which are identifiable by distinct shapes and colors typical in real-world plants. Hence, neither yellow coneflowers nor red poppies are explicitly present or identifiable in the image.",
