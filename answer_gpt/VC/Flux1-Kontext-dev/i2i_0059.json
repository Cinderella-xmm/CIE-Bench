        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a mechanical elephant is depicted in a forest setting with no sign of a steak present. This means there is no steak to appear charred or cooked. By using visual cues and common recognition of what a charred steak looks like, we understand the absence of any food items in the scene.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of carrot slices or any food items. The focus is instead on a mechanical elephant in a wooded environment. Utilizing visual recognition and understanding of common objects, it is clear there are no carrots to assess color or shape.",
