        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The astronaut's face area in Image B is covered by a blurred effect, indicating there is no clear visibility of the face through the visor. The visor appears circular, but the blurring obscures any facial features.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a large, boxy structure on the back of the astronaut, which resembles a typical life-support pack used in spacesuits for carrying life-sustaining equipment.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B includes areas around the elbows and knees where the fabric is gathered or patterned in a way consistent with segmented joints, typical of articulated spacesuits designed for flexibility.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a stylized illustration, does not depict any dust being kicked up beneath the astronaut’s boot. The surface appears smooth without dynamic movement of dust.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a bright, spherical Earth visible in the sky behind the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bright spherical object in the sky behind the astronaut in Image B resembles a celestial body, but based on common stylization, it likely represents the Sun or Moon, as there is a lack of distinct Earth-like features.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the helmet as a smooth, circular dome, but due to the nature of a drawn illustration, the reflective quality is implied rather than vividly portrayed, unlike in a realistic image.",
