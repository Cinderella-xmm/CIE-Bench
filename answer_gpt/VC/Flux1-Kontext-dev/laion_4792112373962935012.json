        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon illustration of a cocktail with a pale yellow liquid inside. The visual cue of a light yellow tone is apparent through the artistic representation, suggesting the drink color is intended to be pale yellow. Combining this visual information with the common understanding that cocktails like margaritas are often illustrated in such colors confirms the hue.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge is depicted as having a bright green outer rind. The interior of the lime, although stylized, displays segments typical of a lime's cross-section.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass rim in Image B is illustrated with a speckled design resembling a mix of granules. The colors appear to be a combination, likely representing a salt or sugar rim often depicted in festive settings, aligning with how cocktails are typically garnished. This stylized representation likely aims to mimic the speckled look of granular substances.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon style of Image B, the ice cubes within the glass are portrayed as white geometric shapes, which suggest the presence of ice. The representation implies angular shapes typical of ice cubes, using artistic abstraction to convey their presence and translucency.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the glass against a bright blue background filled with festive confetti and objects indicative of a celebratory atmosphere. This background does not resemble a dark blue surface but rather a vibrant, illustrative setting. Thus, it is clear the surface is not dark blue.",
