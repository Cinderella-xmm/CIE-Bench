      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted in a seated pose with its left hand resting under its chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla sculpture is in a seated pose, with its left hand resting under its chin, similar to a classic thinker pose. This posture suggests contemplation and is a common representation for sculptures intending to convey a reflective theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have a prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline consistent with a silverback gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a sculpture of a gorilla showing muscular features, but the style is simplified due to the carved wooden appearance. As such, the detailed features like brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline may be stylized. There's not a highly detailed emphasis on facial features specific to the silverback gorilla, contrasting with Image A which depicts more realistic gorilla traits.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct patch resembling a silver saddle located across the back and shoulders of the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the gorilla in a wooden texture, where the typical colors and markings of a silverback—the silver saddle on the back—are not present due to the monochromatic nature of the wooden carving. Silverback gorillas are known for this silver patch, which is absent from the stylized representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gorilla positioned on a horizontal surface that resembles a log or platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla sculpture sits on a structure resembling a log, which is consistent with the stylized depiction of a gorilla in nature or an environment. The carved wooden structure forms the base of the sculpture, similar to a log.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s right arm resting on its right knee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the gorilla sculpture with its right arm resting on its right knee, similar to the pose of Image A. This posture is typical of seated gorillas, which often rest their arms on their knees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gorilla’s gaze directed forward and slightly downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gaze direction in Image B is not distinctly clear due to the style of the wooden sculpture, which doesn't show precise facial expressions or gaze directions. The stylized nature makes it challenging to determine the gaze direction accurately.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements present in the background, even if stylized or etched?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are elements resembling leaves in a stylized or carved form in the background. These leaves are part of the surrounding design, which frames the gorilla and suggests a natural environment.",
