      "question": "Is the \"Indian\" script logo visible and legible on the fuel tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the script logo on the fuel tank is not visible or legible, suggesting that the branding details are omitted or blurred. The fuel tank appears plain without the logo that is usually associated with Indian motorcycles. Therefore, my reasoning is based on the observation that the tank does not feature any discernible logo from this perspective.",

      "question": "Are the engine cylinders arranged in a V-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible characteristics of the engine cylinders in Image B are indicative of a V-shaped or V-twin configuration, which is a common design for certain motorcycles, including cruiser styles that Indian motorcycles are typically known for. The cylinders visibly stem from the central engine block outwards in a diagonal manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows two chrome exhaust pipes positioned on the right side of the motorcycle. These pipes are gleaming and run parallel to each other, which is distinctively visible in the edited image. This arrangement aligns with common cruiser motorcycle designs that often emphasize such chrome details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is equipped with a black seat positioned above the engine and behind the fuel tank. The seat is visible and conforms to typical cruiser designs where comfort and position are crucial for rider ergonomics.",

      "question": "Is the fuel tank white and smooth with rounded contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fuel tank in Image B displays a very smooth, white surface with rounded contours, neatly integrated into the motorcycle's design. Its pristine appearance is consistent with the color and finishing often found in cruiser-style motorcycles, confirming its visual characteristics.",

      "question": "Do the exhaust pipes connect directly to the engine block?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exhaust pipes are connected to the engine block in a manner characteristic to the functioning of motorcycle exhaust systems. They appear to be extensions designed to channel exhaust gases away from the engine efficiently, maintaining an industrial design logic in terms of placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a low-slung, cruiser-style silhouette with a forward-leaning stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the motorcycle in Image B exhibits a low-slung profile, which is typical of cruiser-style designs. The motorcycleâ€™s stance, combined with its handlebars, wheels, and chassis alignment, suggests a forward-leaning orientation that is characteristic of cruisers meant for relaxed riding rather than aggressive, upright postures.",
