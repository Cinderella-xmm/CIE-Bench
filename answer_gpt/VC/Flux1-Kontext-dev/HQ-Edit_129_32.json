        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate bow exhibits elaborate symmetrical scrollwork, maintaining the original design elements of multiple spherical finials as observed. This is evident upon examining the intricate patterns and curvature, which appear unchanged compared to the standard expectations for such designs. Comparing it with Image A confirms consistency in these features.",
