      "question": "Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot has a dome-shaped head with circular elements resembling porthole eyes. Based on world knowledge, a dome shape with evenly spaced features is likely symmetrical and consistent. By analyzing the visual elements, it can be inferred that the design intends to have three porthole-like eyes, much like common depictions of robotic or sci-fi characters.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot's chest with a transparent panel through which the internal gear mechanism is visible. This is evident from the clear visual representation of mechanical components within a framed section on the chest, consistent with common design elements used to display intricate internal machinery in a compact manner, commonly seen in steampunk or mechanical themes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B has arms that visually suggest segmentation and piston-like joints. The detailing along the limbs includes distinct breaks and rounded segments that resemble mechanical joints, a design commonly used to suggest mobility and range of motion for robotic appendages.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the robot are visible, and each appears equipped with claw-like structures. Although visually they might be hard to count definitively as being exactly five, their general form and structure suggest intended symmetry. This type of mechanical design is characteristic of attempts to mimic biological forms for balance or aesthetic purposes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the robot's head in Image B is shown with protruding elements resembling spires and antennae. These are distinct and are positioned in a way that one appears central and others lateral, consistent with a design aimed at giving a semblance of coordination or sensor arrangement typical of robotic characters in fiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chest panel of Image B is transparent, and within it, there's a clear display of interlocking gears of varying sizes. This visual setup is aligned with the depiction of a complex mechanical system, where gears are commonly used in varying sizes to convey intricacy and function typically found in machine operations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B prominently features oxidized bronze and copper tones, giving an aged effect common in such thematic constructs. This patina and wear look implies age and use, often used to add historicity or antiquity aesthetics to mechanical designs, especially in steampunk styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the rivets and mechanical fasteners visible along the joints and edges of the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows detailing along the robot's joints and edges, where rivets and fasteners are visibly depicted. Such detailing is typical in metal construction where structural integrity and assembly points are often emphasized visually to suggest robustness and mechanical precision, fitting within the mechanical aesthetic.",
