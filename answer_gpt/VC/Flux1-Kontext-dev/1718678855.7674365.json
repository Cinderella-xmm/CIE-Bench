    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the capybara's snout appears broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, which aligns with the typical anatomical features of real-world capybaras. This assessment is based on the observation of the visible parts of the snout, which mirror the distinct facial characteristics common to capybaras.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The capybara in image B has ears that appear small and rounded, positioned relatively high on its head. This matches the characteristic ear shape and placement typically seen on capybaras, helping to identify the animal.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the capybara standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the capybara appears to be standing upright, with its body oriented in a direct frontal view towards the observer. This posture can be inferred from the placement and alignment of the capybara's shoulders and visible chest.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands positioned in front of the chest, gripping an object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the capybara's hands placed in front of its chest, each holding an object, conforming with the description. This positioning suggests the capybara is engaging with something directly in front of it, with both hands firmly grasping the object.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the capybara’s fur primarily light brown with darker tones around the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a capybara whose fur is predominantly light brown, with slightly darker shades observable around the muzzle area. This color scheme is consistent with the natural fur coloration of real capybaras, incorporating slight variations in hue.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the capybara have a stocky, large body with short legs and a thick torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The capybara in image B seems to exhibit a stocky, substantial body, characterized by a thick torso and short legs. This body structure aligns with the real-world capybara anatomy, recognized for their robust physiques and relatively stumpy limbs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The other limbs, although not directly visible, are implied to exist based on the posture and proportional anatomy of the capybara in image B. Given natural body symmetry and common anatomical arrangements, it is reasonable to deduce the presence of the typical four limbs.",
