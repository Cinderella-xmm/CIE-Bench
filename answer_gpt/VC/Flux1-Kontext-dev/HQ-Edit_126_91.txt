    "Question": "Q3: Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the piano placed within a room with large windows, not within a corridor setting.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is comprised of large square tiles that have a uniform light shade rather than alternating dark and light colors. This consistent tile color does not support the pattern described in the question, which specifies alternation in shading.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the piano situated inside what appears to be a room with windows and marble-patterned walls, lacking any columnar structures that resemble a corridor. There are no tall columns creating a symmetrical passageway, hence the setting differs from that described in the question.",

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are soft shadows cast beneath the piano and along the floor, consistent with overhead lighting from above?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting within the room seems to be coming from the side windows rather than overhead, resulting in shadows that appear to complement this lighting direction. The shadows on the floor do appear soft but cannot be solely attributed to overhead lighting, indicating a different lighting setup.",
