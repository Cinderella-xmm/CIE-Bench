      "question": "Does the edited subject (anthropomorphic bull) maintain the rightward walking posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is not an anthropomorphic bull, but rather a human character dressed in knight armor with horns, who is walking. The posture is forward-facing, not specifically rightward. In Image A, the elephant is walking straight towards the viewer. Based on this information, in Image B, the posture is not distinctly rightward.",

      "question": "Is the saddle and seating arrangement for the riders preserved intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no saddle or seating arrangement visible because the focus is on a knight in armor walking along a path. In Image A, there was a saddle with individuals riding an elephant. Since the scene has changed drastically in Image B, the saddle and seating arrangement are no longer present.",

      "question": "Are the riders still positioned directly atop the anthropomorphic bull, maintaining their original relative height from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene does not include an anthropomorphic bull with riders. Instead, it features an armored knight walking on a path. In Image A, riders were positioned on top of an elephant, elevated from the ground. The change in the scene means there are no riders on an elevated position relative to the ground in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the dirt path retain its uneven and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path still appears to have a dirt-like appearance with an unpaved, natural texture, similar to Image A. The terrain maintains a similar uneven nature as seen in the original image of Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is natural foliage visible on the sides of the path, with trees and greenery present in the scene. This is consistent with Image A, where trees and vegetation frame the pathway. Hence, the natural component of the scene is preserved in terms of foliage.",
