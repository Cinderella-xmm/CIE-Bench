    "Question": "Q8: Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the lighting within the box seems to originate from the front rather than any particular angle like upper left. This results in even illumination, and does not produce distinct shadows on the elephant or the grass that would suggest a specific direction of light.",
    "answer": "No"
