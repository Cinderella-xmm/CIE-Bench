      "question": "Does the plate retain its circular shape and raised rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate maintains its circular shape and has a raised rim, which is a characteristic feature of dinner plates. The plate is clearly visible behind the spoon and retains its 3D visual form. This conclusion is drawn from the observation that the edges are smooth and round, which is consistent with a typical plate design.",

      "question": "Is the plate still white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate remains white. This is observed from its color in the central part of the image, which retains a uniform white hue. White plates are common due to their simplicity and ability to contrast with food, which helps with presentation. The plate's white color in the image is consistent with this common attribute.",

      "question": "Does the spoon retain its metallic finish and reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spoon in Image B appears metallic and reflective. Its surface reflects light, showing a distinct shine typical of metal objects. The reflective quality is an inherent property of materials like stainless steel, commonly used for spoons. This observation remains consistent with the typical appearance of a metal spoon, indicating no change in its material finish.",

      "question": "Is the spoon still oriented vertically on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon is positioned vertically as observed from its alignment in the center of the plate, with the handle at the bottom and the spoon head at the top. This vertical orientation is a deliberate and organized positioning common in visual presentations involving utensils.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the plate and spoon still centrally positioned in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plate and the spoon continue to hold a central position in Image B. They are distinctly placed in the middle of the image, balancing the composition and making them the focal point of the image. This centric arrangement is often used to draw immediate attention to the main objects when no other complex backgrounds are involved.",
