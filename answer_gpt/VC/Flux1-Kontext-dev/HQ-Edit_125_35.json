        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, a red velvet cushion is visible beneath the transformed saxophone (serpent).

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, around the perimeter of the red velvet cushion, a thin gold trim is clearly visible. The trim contrasts with the red color of the cushion, making it stand out. This detail is consistent with the described feature of a thin gold trim around the cushion's edge.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to originate from above, as indicated by the concentration of brightness on the saxophone and the cushion, which then gently fades into darkness toward the frame's edges. This lighting setup suggests a spotlight effect, consistent with the description.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed saxophone, which has taken the form of a serpent, is positioned diagonally on the cushion. It extends from the bottom part of the left side upwards to the top right corner of the image, consistent with the stated orientation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that is predominantly dark, with a spotlight illuminating the central subject (the transformed saxophone/serpent). There are no other visible objects or textures in the background, maintaining a consistent and uniform darkness beyond the spotlight's reach.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed serpent in Image B displays a glossy, metallic texture. The highlights and reflections on its surface suggest a material similar to polished brass, as they are sharp and mirror-like. This matches the description of a reflective metallic appearance, like polished brass.",
