      "question": "Are the round wire-rimmed spectacles present on the elderly gentleman's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the elderly gentleman has facial features with no visible spectacles. Given the absence of any eyewear, and based on common knowledge about spectacles, it's reasonable to conclude they are not present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly gentleman is depicted with white hair, however, the area around the mouth is obscured, making it impossible to discern any facial hair. Therefore, concluding the presence of a mustache or goatee purely from available visual cues is not feasible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elderly gentleman holding a newspaper. His hands are visibly positioned on each side of the newspaper, suggesting he is supporting it in an open manner. This aligns with the typical manner of reading a newspaper across the lap.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visual indication of any satchel next to the elderly gentleman on the bench. Without suitable supporting visual cues, it can be concluded that the satchel is absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the elderly gentleman standing with no apparent seating structure like a bench in view. Thus, there are no visible armrests or backrests accompanying the bench.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly gentleman is standing rather than seated with any posture involving crossing legs. Therefore, the representation of crossing legs is not applicable.",
