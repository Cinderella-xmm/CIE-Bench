    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the river present beneath the bridge, flowing from the background toward the foreground with visible white water over mossy rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river is visible beneath the bridge. The water flows from the background toward the foreground, which is evident by the movement of the water and its dispersion over the rocks and logs. The presence of white water indicates a flowing river, which is typical when water encounters obstacles like mossy rocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there moss-covered rocks visible in the river, especially near the center and right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct moss-covered rocks in the river, particularly noticeable in various locations along the water flow, especially near the center and right side of the frame. These rocks are characterized by their green hue indicating moss coverage.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple fallen logs visible along the left and right riverbanks, some partially submerged in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several logs are visible along the river banks. These logs are positioned on both the left and right sides of the river, contributing to the natural landscape. Some logs appear to be partially submerged, showing the interaction between the river and the forest debris.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a canopy of green leaves overhead, allowing dappled sunlight to filter down onto the bridge and river?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a significant canopy of green leaves above the entire scene. The sunlight filtering through creates patches of light and shadow, known as dappled sunlight, which is common in forested environments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there several large, moss-covered tree trunks leaning toward the bridge from the left bank, with one prominently curving over the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple large tree trunks with moss coverage leaning towards the bridge, especially from the left side. One of these tree trunks is prominently visible, curving over the bridge adding to the composition and the natural setting of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image captured from a low-angle viewpoint, looking upward at the bridge from near the river level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is captured from a low-angle perspective, as evidenced by the upward view towards the bridge. This viewpoint is typical when photographing objects from close to a river level, allowing the structure to appear imposing within its environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the bridge structure extend horizontally across the river, supported by towers on both sides, forming a continuous span?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge visually extends horizontally over the river. It is supported by towers on both sides, ensuring a continuous span from one side of the river to the other, following typical bridge construction to connect areas across river banks.",
