      "question": "Is the \"Schildkröt\" brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Schildkröt' brand name is visible on the ball box situated next to the paddles within the open box. This is a clear depiction as the text 'Schildkröt' is written prominently on the box in a recognizable font. Given that branding is often an important identification feature, it is logical that this visible logo would be recognized easily. Therefore, the Schildkröt branding is indeed visible. Image A, upon comparison, shows the same brand name clearly on the ball box, confirming the visibility in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two paddles, each held by the cartoon characters, with visually distinct rubber surfaces, one red and one blue. This visual distinction is enhanced by the contrasting colors, which are clearly applied to each paddle's rubber surface, making them easily identifiable to viewers. The color distinction is used often in table tennis equipment design, aiding in accurate depiction. In Image A, both paddles are visible with the same color scheme when comparing, confirming that each paddle has one red surface and one blue surface.",

      "question": "Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are shown to have handles but do not display any distinguishable logos, diamond-shaped or otherwise. Typically, explicit logos are visually accentuated for branding purposes, and in this image, no specified logo is visible on the paddle handles. In Image A, a diamond-shaped logo is present on the handle of each paddle, indicating that the edited image lacks this detail.",

      "question": "Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts two paddles within the box setup, held by two cartoon figures who visually convey a sense of interaction and preparation for play. This ensures that only two paddles are evident within the scene, contributing to the play narrative depicted in the adventure theme. Image A reinforces this depiction, showcasing exactly two paddles in the box, which matches the count seen in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is a rope handle visibly attached to the left side of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no rope handle is attached to the left side of the box. Visually, the box in the scene has no such accessory, as various design features such as carrying handles are typically emphasized and would be clearly seen attached to the box. Image A, however, includes a rope handle, highlighting a contrast between the two images where the edited image lacks this feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box design provides the visual impression of a singular space holding the paddles without any divider to section off specific compartments. Typically, box dividers offer structural organization within packaging, which would be distinctly delineated. On comparing with Image A, there is a horizontal partition visible, clarifying the presence and purpose of holding items securely. Image B thereby lacks this structural element.",

      "question": "Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the box as a somewhat rectangular shape with a lid depicted through the drawing opened upward, as revealed by the illustration. Hinged designs often highlight such upward opening for ease of access. Common understanding of box shapes aligns with this depiction. In Image A, the box also exhibits this characteristic rectangular shape with a hinged lid design, confirming such a structure in both images.",
