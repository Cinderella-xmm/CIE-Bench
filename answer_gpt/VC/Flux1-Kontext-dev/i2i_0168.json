      "question": "Are the carrots depicted in a bright orange color with their rounded-tapered shape preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are clearly depicted with a bright orange color, which is a typical characteristic of carrots. Their shape is rounded at the top and tapers slightly towards the bottom, consistent with common carrot shapes that are often depicted with a bulbous form for illustrative purposes. This observation reflects common visual representations of carrots, combining visual cues with general knowledge of carrot characteristics.",

      "question": "Are the carrots topped with bright green serrated leaves with a lobed appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the carrots are topped with bright green leaves, characterized by a serrated and lobed appearance, which is typical for carrot foliage. This observation aligns with the knowledge that carrot greens are usually frilled and lobed, supporting the visual cues seen in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the soil texture surrounding the carrotsâ€™ roots preserved showing they are rooted in soil rather than snow or ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are shown surrounded by snow rather than soil. The texture is smooth and white, consistent with snow rather than the dark and granular texture of soil. This observation contradicts the idea of being rooted in soil, as the surrounding environment does not visually represent soil.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the carrots positioned in a way that shows they are partially underground, consistent with their natural growth pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots appear to be positioned only slightly underneath the surface of the snow rather than deep underground as they naturally grow. Though they are partially embedded, the setting does not reflect typical soil embedding, as snow is visible instead. This does not fully depict the natural growth pattern of being deeply rooted in soil.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the carrots have visible surface textures like natural ridges or marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the visible surface of the carrots includes natural ridges and marks which are characteristic of real carrots. These surfaces are consistent with the typical texture expected on carrots due to their growth conditions. This visual information aligns with general knowledge about the typical surface texture of carrots.",
