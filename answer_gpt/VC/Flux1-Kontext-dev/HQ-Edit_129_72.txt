    "Question": "Q1: Is the bird positioned in a side-facing profile, facing left?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is positioned sideways with its profile visible, and it is facing towards the left of the frame. The bird's beak points towards the left, confirming its left-facing profile. Comparing with Image A, which also shows a side-facing profile towards the left, Image B maintains the same orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the bird’s feet visibly gripping the branch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feet are shown clearly as they wrap around the branch, demonstrating a gripping position. This feature is evident from the detailed depiction of the bird's claws around the branch, similar to how it's shown in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the main branch extend diagonally from the lower-left to the upper-right of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main branch extends from the left side towards the right, but primarily from the middle to the upper right, instead of a clear diagonal from lower-left to upper-right. Similarly, Image A shows the main branch from the middle to the upper right. Thus, neither image displays a diagonal from lower-left to upper-right.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple clusters of blossoms distributed along the side branches of the main twig?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows multiple clusters of orange blossoms along the side branches stemming from the main twig. These clusters are distributed such that the blossoms appear in groups along the extending branches, similar to the snowy clusters in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are white snowflakes visible falling throughout the sky background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no white snowflakes visible; instead, the background is a gradient blue without any snowfall effect. In contrast, Image A displays white snowflakes falling throughout and settling on the bird and branches. Thus, Image B lacks these snowflakes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the background a uniform pale blue sky without clouds or gradients?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a gradient background transitioning into darker shades. This gradient distinguishes Image B from having a uniform pale blue sky. Image A presents a uniform pale blue sky with snowfall as opposed to Image B’s gradient backdrop.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the bird located near the center of the image, with blossoms appearing on both the left and right sides of the branch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is positioned near the middle of the frame, with blossoms evident on both the left and right sides of the branch extending across the frame. This composition keeps the bird central and surrounded by foliage, akin to Image A's layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
