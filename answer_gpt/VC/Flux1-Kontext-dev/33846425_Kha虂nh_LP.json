      "question": "Is the woman’s face clearly visible with closed eyes and a relaxed expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face is not clearly visible. It appears deliberately blurred, obscuring facial details such as eyes and expression. Common sense suggests this is done to protect privacy, thus making it impossible to determine her expression or if her eyes are closed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair is visibly long, dark, and straight, extending past her shoulders. This is evidenced by the strands flowing down and resting on her clothing, as observed from the outlines and typical texture associated with straight black hair.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is indeed wearing a white lace dress. The lace pattern prominent on the bodice and skirt visually suggests floral embroidery. The texture and design consistent with lace dresses often display floral patterns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a woven tote bag is placed next to the woman on the car's hood. The bag shows a two-tone design using beige and natural brown colors, typical of woven materials. However, there is no visible bow on the handle; rather, the handles are plain. The bag design reflects organic material aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is accurately positioned on the car's hood. Her posture shows one hand is clearly resting on the hood's surface for balance, and her legs are positioned on the hood but not visibly crossed over the bumper. This suggests a casual, relaxed position rather than an explicit cross-legged posture.",
