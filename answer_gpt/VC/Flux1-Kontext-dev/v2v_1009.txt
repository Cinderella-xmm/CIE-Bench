    "Question": "Q4: Is the arrangement of vegetables in the bowl natural and non-symmetrical, with both carrots and cauliflower present in similar quantities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the carrot slices and cauliflower florets appears organic and non-symmetrical. While there is no precise symmetry, both types of vegetables seem to be present in roughly equal quantities, contributing to a balanced visual.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the carrots distinctly orange and the cauliflower distinctly white in color?",
