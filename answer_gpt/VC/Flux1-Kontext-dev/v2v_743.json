      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is indeed wearing a bright yellow shirt and headband.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object held by the character is clearly a tennis racket.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hairstyle is messy and tousled, resembling the typical look of a tennis player during an active match. This perception is due to the hair protruding in different directions and being held partially by the headband, contributing to a casual and dynamic sports appearance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's posture, with slightly bent arms holding the racket and a forward-leaning stance, suggests a state of readiness. Such a posture is common in sports scenarios, particularly in tennis, where players must be prepared to move and react quickly to the incoming ball.",
