      "question": "Is the subject’s left leg raised and held behind her back with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a pose that involves her right leg being raised and held behind her back with her left arm. This yoga pose, known commonly as the dancer pose, typically involves one leg being curved upwards and held by the opposite hand. The left arm is extended forward. This posture is more characteristic of holding with one hand rather than both. Based on the visual cues, the subject does not use both hands to hold the left leg; instead, it is the right leg held by the right hand.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is positioned behind the subject in such a way that it casts a bright glow around her figure. This creates an effect similar to a halo around her silhouette.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach surface appears to be glossy and reflective, indicative of a wet surface.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is shown standing barefoot, with her left foot flat on the ground, maintaining balance in the dancer pose. The focus is on the left foot's firm placement rather than the right, which is lifted and held. This depiction is common in yoga and dance images, where grounding oneself is essential for maintaining posture.",
