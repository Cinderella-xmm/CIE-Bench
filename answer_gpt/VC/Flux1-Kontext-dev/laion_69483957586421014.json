      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the brand name \"WARING\" displayed in bold white capital letters on a black rectangular plaque with a textured border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food processor's base prominently displays the brand name 'WARING' in bold white capital letters, centered within a black rectangular plaque that has a textured border. This visual cue is interpreted as such based on the color contrast and typical branding presentation. By comparing with Image A, it can be confirmed that the brand name and its style are consistent with common branding styles, thus confirming the answer.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the control buttons labeled \"OFF\" (red), \"ON\" (green), and \"PULSE\" (blue) arranged horizontally on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B shows three buttons on the front-facing part of the processor's base. The colors of these buttons are red, green, and blue, marked as 'OFF', 'ON', and 'PULSE', and they appear to be arranged in a horizontal line. This positioning comes off clearly upon inspection. The design from Image A corroborates this horizontal layout as typical for intuitive user interfaces on similar appliances.",

      "question": "Does the processing bowl have a black handle attached to its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the processing bowl of the food processor clearly has a black handle on its left side. This is evident from the visual structure in which the handle is distinctly contrasting against the bowl's transparent section and stands out due to its color and solid design. From prior observation of Image A, this handle's position is intended for user control and remains consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a transparent lid covering the bowl with a vertical feed tube and a pusher mechanism visible at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transparent lid over the bowl with a vertical component extending upwards that appears to be the feed tube, accompanied by what looks like a pusher mechanism on top. This conclusion is drawn from the arrangement and typical design of food processor lids. In comparison to Image A, the primary function and appearance align with such standard configurations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the feed tube a tall, vertical cylinder extending upward from the center of the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the feed tube indeed resembles a tall, vertical cylinder; however, it extends from the side of the lid rather than the center. Viewing it, combined with standard product design characteristics, a central position would typically line up centrally, but here, the position distinctly is off-center. Image A also confirms this off-center but vertically oriented design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the base of the food processor silver metallic with black feet at the bottom corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the food processor in Image B showcases a silver metallic finish with small black feet at each bottom corner, apparent due to the reflection and sheen typical of metallic surfaces contrasted against darker elements. Verification against Image A further supports this design choice.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the food processor maintain the same proportional relationship between the base, bowl, and feed tube as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the relationships between the base, bowl, and feed tube seem consistent and proportionate. The visual framing and proportionate sizing appear to be identical in both images, maintaining a harmonious design balance. The analysis of dimensions in both images confirmed this observation.",
