    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmarks do not resemble the curved and tapering silhouette seen in the central golden skyscraper in Image A. The skyscraper has a distinctive curve and taper at the top which does not appear in any of the bookmarks that follow more angular and straight designs. Therefore, the bookmark does not retain these features.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while one bookmark does have a tall, protruding section suggesting asymmetry, it does not perfectly match the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper in Image A which has a unique alignment. The bookmark's shape is more simplified compared to the sharp asymmetry of the skyscraper.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark that seems to represent the skyscraper next to the central tower does have a stepped design with multiple tiers similar to the rectangular form in Image A. The stepped structure is notably preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark corresponding to the right-side skyscraper has a design with vertical lines that echo the light strip pattern seen in Image A's skyscraper. The pattern is evident in the bookmark through the use of vertical grooves.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmarks generally maintain a simplified and less tapered design compared to the central skyscraper in Image A, resulting in a different height-to-width ratio and lacking the tapering proportion that defines the skyline. Thus, these proportions are not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the wider base of the central skyscraper compared to its upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark does not reflect the distinct wider base seen in the central skyscraper of Image A. The base of the bookmark follows a uniform width similar to the rest of its structure, deviating from the wider base that characterizes the skyscraper.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the red buoy present in the final image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of a red buoy within the visual frame as seen in Image A, where a red buoy is clearly positioned in the water. Thus, this element is absent in the final image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
