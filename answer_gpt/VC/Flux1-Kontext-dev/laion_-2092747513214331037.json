      "question": "Is the cyclist in a forward-leaning position with hands on aerobars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist is depicted in a forward-leaning position typical of time-trial or aerodynamic cycling posture, with hands resting on aerobars, showcased by the streamlined rider's body position and the presence of specialized handlebar extensions. This posture is common in cycling to minimize wind resistance and maintain high speed.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a futuristic, digital setting without the conventional road structure visible; instead, the background suggests a high-tech environment that might not adhere to regular traffic markings like white lane lines or yellow center dividers.",
