      "question": "Is the brown, segmented, textured trunk of the palm tree present with visible horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe a tall, brown trunk that appears segmented, typical of palm trees. The texture of the trunk has visible horizontal ridges which are characteristic of palm trees as they grow. These horizontal ridges are where the fronds have fallen off over time. This matches common characteristics of a palm tree trunk.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the long, feathery green fronds forming a radial crown at the top of the palm tree present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a tall tree with a crown of green, feathery fronds extending outward in a radial pattern. This radial pattern is typical of palm trees, where the long fronds extend outward from the top, creating a rounded crown shape that captures sunlight efficiently.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are some of the palm frond tips visibly browned or dried?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm fronds are mainly green, but the tips of several fronds exhibit a browning or dried appearance. This browning can be a natural process in palm fronds due to environmental conditions or lack of nutrients, which is a common occurrence in palm trees as older fronds begin to die.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the palm tree positioned to the left of the cactus and taller than it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear visual comparison between the palm tree and the cactus. The palm tree is positioned to the left of the cactus and is noticeably taller, as its fronds extend higher up into the sky than the tallest segment of the cactus.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the palm fronds primarily green in color, with some yellowing or browning at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm fronds are predominantly green, indicating healthy leaves. There are noticeable instances of yellowing or browning particularly at the edges or tips of the fronds, which could be an indication of minor stress or natural aging of the fronds.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the palm tree maintain a tall, narrow trunk with a broad, rounded crown of fronds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual information in Image B shows a palm tree with a tall, narrow trunk leading up to a broad, rounded crown composed of feathery fronds. This classic silhouette is typical of palm trees, where the trunk remains slender while the top forms a rounded, expansive pattern of fronds.",
