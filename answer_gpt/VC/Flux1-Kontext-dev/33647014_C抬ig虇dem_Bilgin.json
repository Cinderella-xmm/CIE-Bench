      "question": "Is the alternating pattern of light and dark squares on the chessboard preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chessboard displays a pattern of alternating light and dark squares, which is typical for chessboards and essential for gameplay. This contrasts aligns with our common understanding of chessboard design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the king is centrally located among the visible chess pieces in the row, identifiable by its distinct crown compared to other pieces. This matches typical chess setups where the king is often positioned centrally within a lineup.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows of the chess pieces clearly fall diagonally toward the bottom-left, indicating a light source from the top-right direction, consistent with typical shadow behavior based on lighting direction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the count of chess pieces deviates from eight, particularly with the addition of humanoid figures and unique pieces, differing from the traditional setup of eight visible chess pieces.",
