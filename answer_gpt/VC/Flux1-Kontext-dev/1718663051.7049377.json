    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there exactly one tree positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a single tree prominently placed in the center of the scene. This is evident because the tree is the main vertical element dividing the image symmetrically, drawing attention directly to the middle of the visual. The positioning suggests the tree acts as a focal point, a common design element to convey centrality and importance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree have a clearly defined layered canopy structure with multiple horizontal tiers of foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree showcases a distinct canopy structure that consists of multiple horizontal layers of foliage. This is discernible from the way the foliage appears stacked in ascending tiers, contributing to the overall silhouette of the tree. This layering is a recognizable feature in certain tree species, which is used here to give the tree a well-arranged appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tree positioned in front of the mountain range in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is clearly depicted in the foreground with mountains visible behind it. This placement is visually logical because the tree overlaps and obscures a small portion of the mountain range, establishing its position in front of the mountains. Such composition is typical in landscape art to convey depth.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible shadow extending from the base of the tree onto the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic style emphasizes stylization over realism, and while the design elements include light rays, there is no distinct shadow cast from the tree that is visible on the ground. The absence of clear shadow detail aligns with the stained-glass style abstraction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat grassy plain beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the tree, the ground appears to be a grassy plain that is relatively flat. This is conveyed through the smooth transitions of color and texture in the stained-glass style, representing a flat grass land, a common base for illustrating outdoor landscapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there mountains visible in the background behind the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly features a mountain range in the background, discernible by the characteristic peaks and separations typical of mountain illustrations. These are located behind the tree, adding depth to the landscape composition and enhancing the natural setting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
