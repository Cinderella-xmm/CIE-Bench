    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, based on the positioning of the bust including the visible ear and the curve of the shoulders, the bust is not facing the side profile to the right but instead appears to be forward-facing, indicating that the orientation is not a profile view.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a visible inscribed plaque on the base where the word 'APOLLO' can be clearly seen. This indicates the identity of the bust and is consistent with the usual presentation in such sculptures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest consistent with the original sculptural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest in Image B are consistent with Image A. The sculptural form maintains symmetry and anatomy similar to classical busts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows drapery originating at the left shoulder and extending diagonally across the chest in folds. The sculptural detail closely mirrors classical drapery styles seen in historical busts, similar to those replicated in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the base as cylindrical with a flat top and slightly rounded bottom. This corresponds with typical bust pedestals designed to provide stable support, as can be validated by similar design structures in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a small circular ornament visible on the left shoulder of the drapery, indicative of embellishments often found in classical sculptures to denote texture or style. Image A's drapery also contains similar ornamental detail.",
