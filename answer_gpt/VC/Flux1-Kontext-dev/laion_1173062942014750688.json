    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the blue circular spots present on the serpent’s body, positioned as eyes or eye-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a serpent-like arrangement of beads with blue circular spots on each bead, resembling eye-like features. These are consistently positioned and distinct on each bead, suggesting a symmetrical pattern akin to eyes on a serpent's body.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the red and yellow colors form the primary scale patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors on the beads are red and yellow, which form the primary pattern across the beads, representing the scales. These colors are visually prominent and create a continuous pattern along the length of the serpent-like structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black zigzag or spotted patterns visible as tribal markings on the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits black patterns on the beads that appear as zigzag lines or tribal marking designs. These patterns are visible and add to the detailed appearance of the serpent's body.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segments of the serpent’s body shaped like spheres or near-spheres, reflecting the original bead form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beads in Image B are distinctly spherical, which mirrors the original form of beads and contributes to the continuity in the appearance of the serpent's segmented body. Each segment maintains a near-spherical shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface of the serpent retain a matte, slightly uneven texture resembling hand-painted craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a smooth, slightly glossy finish on the beads, contrary to a matte or uneven texture typical of hand-painted craftsmanship. The appearance suggests a more polished finish, indicative of mass production rather than handcrafted artistry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the colors red, yellow, blue, black, and white all present in the serpent’s body, maintaining the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the predominant colors visible on the beads are red, yellow, black, and blue. The absence of white indicates that not all colors from the original palette are present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the serpent’s body irregular and varied from segment to segment, matching the original bead diversity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows uniformity in the design of each bead, with similar color patterns and layout, lacking the irregularity and diversity that might be expected from handcrafted beads. This suggests a consistent pattern rather than varied designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
