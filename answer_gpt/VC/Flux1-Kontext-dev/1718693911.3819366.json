      "question": "Is the cat's fur predominantly white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the pop-art style that alters the original colors, the dominant color of the cat appears to be light, with tones of yellow which can be interpreted as representing white fur. Pop-art styles often use vibrant colors that do not match real-world colors, but the original features are generally maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cat sitting upright on the sand with front paws forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's pose is visible. The cat appears to be in an upright sitting position, with its paws positioned in front of its body. The outline and posture are clear, despite the stylized color scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a hot dog in a bun with a zigzag of mustard on top, placed in front of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in front of the cat resembles a hot dog in a bun. However, the mustard detail is not visibly distinguishable in a zigzag pattern due to the pop-art style simplification and coloring.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the delineation of the harness is stylized, but it does show a strap-like object around the cat's neck and chest, indicating a harness. However, specific features like a buckle and pouch are not clearly detailed in the highly stylized pop-art version.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline and positioning of the sunglasses can be seen covering the upper part of the cat's face, maintaining their placement even in the pop-art transformation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible white whiskers extending from the cat's muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's whiskers are represented as black lines extending from its muzzle. In pop-art, strong outlines are common, and thus whiskers maintain their form despite the color change.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although less detailed due to the art style, the tail appears to extend to the right side of the cat's body, indicating a slight curl or bend in that direction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the mustard applied in a zigzag pattern across the top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pop-art style obscures fine details such as the zigzag pattern of mustard on the hot dog. The design does not illustrate such specific detail due to its stylized nature.",
