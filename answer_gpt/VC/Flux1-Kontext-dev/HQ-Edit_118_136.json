    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the skateboarder in the air with a crouched posture. The skater's arms are spread outward, which is a common skateboarding pose especially when airborne as it helps to maintain balance. The visual cues suggest a mid-air maneuver, typical of skateboarding tricks.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's left foot is clearly shown firmly on the skateboard. The right foot, however, is not visibly raised off the board as the feet appear parallel on the skateboard. A typical posture would involve the feet being firmly on the board during flight as seen here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The angle of the skater's head in Image B indicates a focus toward the forward direction, which in the context of skateboarding would imply looking ahead towards the direction of travel to maintain control and foresee landing spots.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly illustrates the skater above the ramp, indicating aerial movement. The spatial separation between the skateboard and the ramp surface confirms the airborne position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a second person, an older man in a dark jacket, visible in the background running across the ramp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a visible figure in the background who appears to be running across the ramp. The attire, including a dark jacket, suggests an older individual, contributing to the dynamic scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a skatepark scene with multiple ramp structures. However, directly beneath the skater, the path appears flat, though adjacent ramps appear curved. The immediate foreground beneath the skater lacks the distinct bowl-like curve, typical in some skateparks but absent directly beneath.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
