    "Question": "Q1: Is the American flag patch present on the right shoulder of the astronaut?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is illustrated in a cartoonish style with a simplified suit design. The flag patch is present on the right shoulder, but it does not resemble the American flag. Instead, it appears to display differently patterned flag patches on each shoulder, which do not match the American flag design. Thus the astronaut lacks the American flag on their uniform.",
