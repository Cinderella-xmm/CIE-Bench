      "question": "Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano's lid is clearly depicted as being open and angled upward, allowing a view into the pianoâ€™s internal structure, which is characteristic of grand pianos to enhance sound projection. The visual cue of the lid being lifted is evident just by observing how it is positioned, providing insight without requiring additional reference to common piano mechanics.",

      "question": "Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the piano supported by four legs, which are designed with detailing and culminate in golden elements at the bottom resembling casters. This is a design trait in many grand pianos to facilitate easier movement and stability. Thus, without needing input from another image, one can conclude that these are indeed casters.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible structure resembling a music stand attached to the piano, especially at the top front edge where one would typically expect to find it for holding sheet music.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing and comparing Image A and Image B, the piano in Image B has a more compact, less elongated appearance and straighter lines in comparison to the original image's curved silhouette noted in grand pianos. The differences highlight altered proportions, preventing a direct silhouette match.",
