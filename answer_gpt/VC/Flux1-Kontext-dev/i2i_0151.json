      "question": "Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is shown in a diamond shape, characterized by two pairs of equal adjacent sides and four equal angles, which is a common kite shape. This can be identified by the symmetrical representation and even angles perceived in the image. Given that diamond-shaped kites are traditional and widely recognized, this observation is consistent with typical depictions.",

      "question": "Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is clearly displayed in a bright yellow color. This vivid color is noticeable against the background, making the kite easily identifiable. The common depiction of kites in bright colors for visibility purposes, especially against a clear sky, aligns with this observation. Comparing with the known bright yellow kite in Image A, this remains unchanged in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are two strings visibly attached to the kite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon close inspection, there appears to be only one string visible attached to the kite, which is typical for a kite. Despite the arrangement and additional decorative items around the image, the presence of only one string is the norm without any additional strings shown.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily features a paper print-out containing the depiction of a kite, which suggests it is not actually flying, but rather printed. However, the image on the paper shows a clear blue sky with some white clouds, creating the illusion or impression that the kite in the image is against a clear sky, consistent with typical portrayals of kites in flight.",

      "question": "Is the kite accompanied by its yellow tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we observe that the kite depicted on the paper includes a yellow tail. The yellow tail can be seen trailing from the bottom, which is consistent with traditional kite designs that utilize tails for balance and aesthetics. The presence of the tail adds to the realism of the representation on the print-out.",
