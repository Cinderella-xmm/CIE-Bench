      "question": "Does the image retain the oval-shaped black sink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sink basin appears to be round in shape and is a light beige color, not black. From analyzing the image, the visual aspects such as its color and outline suggest a switch in both form and color. The sink in Image A is a dark color with a different profile, indicating that the original black oval-shaped sink has been replaced or altered.",

      "question": "Is the mirror still rectangular with an orange backlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror retains a rectangular shape with rounded edges, and there's an evident orange backlight creating an illuminated halo effect. Comparing this to Image A, the same rectangular features and lighting effect are present, suggesting that these aspects have been retained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cabinet underneath the mirror remain a floating style with the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cabinet in Image B appears as a wall-mounted, floating design slightly away from the floor, matching the setup in Image A. Both images depict the cabinet in the same position directly under the mirror, implying that this structure was not altered in terms of style or placement.",

      "question": "Are there metallic faucets present in the sink setup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucet above the sink is dark colored and matches the hanging light fixtures' style, which is frequently crafted from metals like black brushed steel or oil-rubbed bronze. However, it does not have a shiny metallic appearance. Historical knowledge of such designs suggests a darker, matte finish though still metallic. Comparatively, Image A's faucet shares a similar style and appearance, reinforcing this consistent design choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a window to the right of the sink setup, allowing natural light to enter the space, establishing a continuous presence in its architecture as perceived. Image A mirrors this arrangement, with the window located adjacent to the sink setup as part of the room's overall layout.",
