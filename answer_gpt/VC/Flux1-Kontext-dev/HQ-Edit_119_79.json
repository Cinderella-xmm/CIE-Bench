      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the catâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cat with the calico pattern featuring orange, black, and white patches maintained as seen in Image A. World knowledge tells us that calico patterns usually consist of these colors distributed across the body. In both images, these patches are visible in similar locations on the body, notably on the back and tail. Therefore, the spatial arrangement appears preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment of Image B does not include analysis of the eyes because they are obscured. Therefore, with no visible evidence, this cannot be confirmed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the altered material, we can see that the cat retains an upright seated posture with both front paws symmetrically in front of the body, similar to Image A. This posture is common for a cat resting and balances its weight while looking ahead.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nose is obscured in Image B, preventing evaluation of its presence or its surrounding fur.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B is seated on a wooden block that appears to fully support its weight, similar to Image A, as evident from the continuous vertical alignment along the block's surface.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tail curled to the right side, maintaining alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern seen in calico cats, similar to Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Instead of a fluffy patch, Image B features crystalline elements from the neck to the paws, diverging from Image A's fluffy white fur. World knowledge tells us that typically fur textures differ from crystalline ones, implying the absence of the fluffy consistency.",
