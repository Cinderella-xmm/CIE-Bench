    "Question": "Q1: Are the cheetahs still depicted in their original seated and standing postures on the earthen mound?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subjects retain a similar seated and standing posture as observed in Image A. The cheetah in front is still seated, and the cheetah behind is standing, both on the mound. Despite the transformation into robotic figures, their physical stances remain consistent. Therefore, the original postures are maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the earthen mound still present beneath the cheetahs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are still positioned on a similar mound, which resembles the earthen mound in Image A. The surface characteristics are consistent with a mound, providing a base for the cheetahs. Despite the transformation of the cheetahs, the mound itself remains unchanged and present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cheetahs retain their black-ringed tails?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs, transformed into robotic figures, still have tails with a black-ring pattern, similar to the natural pattern visible in Image A. The tail pattern has been preserved through the transformation, maintaining the black rings characteristic of cheetahs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Does the background still feature a savanna landscape with greenery and a horizon line?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a fantastical setting with ornate clock towers and a dramatically lit sky, distinct from the savanna landscape in Image A. While there is an open landscape with greenery and a horizon line in Image B, the presence of unusual structures and lighting effects create a stark difference from the natural savanna, indicating a transformation of the original background.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the relative positioning of the cheetahs (one seated in front, the other standing behind) maintained?",
    "explanation": "The cheetahs in Image B maintain the relative positioning seen in Image A â€“ one is seated at the front, and the other stands behind. This arrangement has been preserved even through the transformation into robotic forms, confirming that their positioning remains unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
