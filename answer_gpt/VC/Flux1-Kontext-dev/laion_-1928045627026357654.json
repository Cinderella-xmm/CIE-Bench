      "question": "Is the man’s long curly hair tied into a low ponytail present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man’s hair flows naturally without being tied into a ponytail. The curls are loose and hang freely. Common hairstyles can be identified by visual cues such as the direction and arrangement of strands, indicating the absence of a tied ponytail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a noticeable hoop earring on the man’s left ear, visible due to its placement and size against the background. Hoop earrings are distinct circular jewelry pieces worn on ears, which can be easily recognized.",

      "question": "Does the woman have a long black braid over her right shoulder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hair is styled in a long black braid which is evident from the tight, spiraled look that runs down her back rather than being positioned over her right shoulder. Braids are characterized by intertwined strands which can be discerned through their texture and shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the woman’s lips colored pink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While facial features are blurred, the context and style in Image B do not explicitly showcase any visible pink lip coloring on the woman. Lip coloring is usually identified by contrasting color against the skin; however, the blur obfuscates such detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals wear shirts that are pinkish-red. However, Image B shows a plain design with a blue pocket on the man's shirt absent of patterns, differing from Image A's patterned style. Patterns are recognized through repetitive designs across fabric.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands placed on the man’s shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the woman’s hands in Image B is on the man's arms rather than his shoulders. The hand placement is observable through the interaction between both individuals, where support or proximity might determine placement style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the man have a full beard and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the depiction in Image B, the man does not exhibit a full beard and mustache. Facial hair presence is noted by its visibility beneath the nose and around the chin and cheeks, absent in this interpretation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features individuals wearing blue pants rather than dark gray, noticeable by the shade and hue change compared to Image A. Pant color is identified by its contrast against other clothing elements and the background, determining its variation.",
