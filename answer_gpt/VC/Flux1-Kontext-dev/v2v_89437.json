      "question": "Is the ALSC logo present in the bottom right corner with the blue \"ALSC\" text, the integrated black checkmark, and the full name \"AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA\" in black capital letters below it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo is visible in the bottom right corner, consisting of the blue 'ALSC' text and an integrated black checkmark. Below this, the text 'AUTHENTICATION LEGALIZATION SERVICES CANADA' is in black capital letters. This description matches typical corporate branding elements such as logos and text placements designed for brand identity. Given the alignment with these elements, which are consistent between Images A and B, the conclusion is logically drawn.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly five orange circular markers positioned along the black checkmark pathway, each containing a white icon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only four orange circular markers are identifiable along the pathway, each with a distinct white icon. Typically, these markers represent distinct steps in a process. Comparing with Image A, which also has four markers, confirms the conclusion for Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icon within the first orange circle at the bottom-left resembles a white magnifying glass over a document, indicating a document verification process. This icon visually communicates scrutiny or inspection, which is consistent with common representations of reviewing or verifying documents. A comparison with Image A shows matching icons, leading to this conclusion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Next to the first orange circle in Image B, the text reads 'We verify your Document'. This text supports the icon visually portrayed, indicating a verification step. Comparing with Image A shows consistency in the text provided next to the first circle, confirming the conclusion.",

      "question": "Are there five blue dots placed along the black checkmark pathway, one between each pair of adjacent orange circles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four blue dots placed on the pathway between the orange circles, which typically represent intermediate steps or stages in a process. This differs from an expectation of five, suggesting a mismatch in placement or count. A comparison with Image A, which also has four blue dots, supports this analysis.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'ALSC 5 Easy Steps' is present at the top, visibly in bold blue font. However, the additional altered, obscured text 'Eontaxctraxion condexity the 9e curio9sjags' misplaces the original subtitle 'For documents to be used in Qatar', altering the expected context. Image A confirms the original text, illustrating the difference.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B remains devoid of any patterns, textures, or colors, maintaining a plain white appearance. This simplicity aligns with corporate or process flow images where focus needs to be on the content rather than distractions. A comparison with Image A reveals consistency, supporting this analysis.",
