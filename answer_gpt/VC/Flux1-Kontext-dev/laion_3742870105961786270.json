      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork on the box clearly depicts a cluster of purple grapes held in the basket on the woman's left arm.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration on the box includes a terracotta jug being held by the woman at her waist. However, there is no visible heart-shaped engraving present on this jug as per the visual analysis.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted goose in the illustration on the box has a white body, which is typical for a domestic goose. The beak is shown as orange, and the details of webbed feet are noticeable, all consistent with realistic portrayals of geese.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration on the box includes the woman wearing a cloak. The details at the neckline show a gold-colored clasp, which can be inferred from the coloring and detailing presented, providing a clasp as a realistic touch to hold the cloak together at the neck, a common aspect in historical or artistic clothing depictions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's depiction on the box clearly shows the woman holding a basket filled with fruit. The illustration emphasizes the items within it as being a red apple, a bunch of purple grapes, and what appears to be other generic fruit shapes, though a distinct green pear is not clearly defined within the visible illustration on the box.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interpretation from the box illustration reveals that the woman is holding a basket near her waist, in her left arm, which is depicted prominently. This positioning is reasonable given typical ways individuals would hold baskets for carrying, as supported by both visual cues and common sense knowledge of carrying items in a basket.",
