      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted against a dark, stormy background with swirling blue energy, yet it is still positioned in the center of the image. The centering of the butterfly is consistent with common photographic composition techniques that draw attention to a focal point. This observation indicates that the butterfly has been deliberately placed to be a central subject in the image, maintaining balanced composition.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its blue color theme, even if reinterpreted as energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is not only blue but also emits a glow of blue energy around it, especially accentuating the wings. The interpretation of the butterfly as an energy form is symbolized through the luminous, ethereal qualities added to the blue theme, while the core color of blue remains dominant.",

      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its general rugged shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bottom of the image has a dark silhouette with a rugged surface. Comparing this with Image B, the edited image, the silhouette is transformed into a landscape with a more defined and elaborate rugged shape, featuring cliffs and valleys. While the complexity has increased, the general theme of a rugged silhouette is maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the butterfly still depicted as hovering above the dark silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is clearly hovering above a rugged landscape that serves as the dark silhouette. The butterfly's position relative to this silhouette signifies hovering, complemented by the depiction of light and shadow providing the illusion of depth and suspension above the landscape.",

      "question": "Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its dark color contrast with the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation into a more detailed landscape, the lower silhouette maintains a dark coloration, providing high contrast against the luminous blue butterfly. The color contrast is a key visual element that helps in emphasizing the butterfly as a focal point while the dark backdrop serves to highlight these vibrant features, similar to Image A.",
