    "Question": "Q1: Does the bear retain its brown fur texture and color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bear appears to have a brown fur color that matches common characteristics of bears, specifically brown bears. While the texture is smooth, it lacks the detailed fur texture typically found in real animals, suggesting a more stylized or cartoonish representation. Using common knowledge of bear appearances, this bear still visually retains a semblance of both color and texture as expected. Thus, based on visual cues, the bear keeps its brown fur color, although stylistically different.",
