      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible horse, bridle, or harness. The edited image focuses on stylized representations of characters rather than a realistic scene with a carriage.

        "No"
      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],

      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any wooden wheels or a carriage structure. The characters' attire does not incorporate elements resembling carriage wheels. Image A shows large wooden wheels as part of the carriage setup, which is absent in the edited design of Image B.",
