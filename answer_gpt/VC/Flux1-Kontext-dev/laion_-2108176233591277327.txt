    "explanation": "The design on the surface of the phoenix egg in Image B includes green shapes that resemble leaves, integrated as part of the intricate, floral and natural pattern. This observation is made by identifying typical leaf-like structures within the artwork, considering color and shape.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the patterns outlined in black to define individual elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals a colorful and detailed design on the surface of the egg, where many of the elements, such as flowers and leaves, appear to be outlined with black to distinguish individual components, making the design clear and well-defined.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the pattern arrangement radially symmetric around the center of the object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the designs on the phoenix egg do not appear to be arranged in a radially symmetric manner around any central point, as there is a more complex arrangement of motifs without a clear radial symmetry. Radial symmetry would imply equidistant, repetitive patterns from a center point, which is not observed.",
    "answer": "No"
}
