        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a black angular design element along the door line, generally positioned for air intake or stylistic purposes. Such a feature aids in aerodynamics and engine cooling, common in sports cars and especially McLarens.",
