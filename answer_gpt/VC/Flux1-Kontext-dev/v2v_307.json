      "question": "Does the bandage retain its rounded rectangular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage is still depicted as a rounded rectangular shape. This is identified by its smooth, rounded corners and elongated body, which is characteristic of many adhesive bandages. This matches the common form of such objects and thus retains its original shape as presented in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the adhesive strip in the same central position on the bandage as in most standard designs. Its size appears consistent with what is typically proportionate on bandages. This is visually confirmed as the central adhesive takes up a smaller rectangular area within the bandage, maintaining its orientation from Image A, assuming the characteristics in Image A are standard.",

      "question": "Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bandage in Image B appears to have a smooth, flat surface, which differs from the common fabric texture appearance seen in typical adhesive bandages. This indicates a departure from the textural elements that might have been present in Image A. Considering that most bandages have a consistent surface texture, it suggests that the visible fabric texture is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the bandage's overall proportions consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Proportions in Image B seem consistent with what a standard adhesive bandage would look likeâ€”an elongated shape with rounded edges, ensuring functional integrity. Assuming Image A adheres to standard proportions for such an item, Image B visually portrays these characteristics with no evident alterations, thereby maintaining its overall proportions.",

      "question": "Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any noticeable shadow beside the bandage, which would typically imply a more three-dimensional appearance. Shadows often provide depth and dimensional context, but their absence here suggests a more flattened portrayal of the bandage compared to what might be in Image A.",
