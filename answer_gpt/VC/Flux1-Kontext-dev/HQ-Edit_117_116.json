    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pink-red feathery flower clusters present in both the foreground and background, positioned on slender green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage and flowers are all rendered in blue hues, unlike the pink-red color scheme present in Image A. These floral clusters are on slender green stems, similar to those in Image A, but the alteration in color to blue in Image B implies the answer should consider the color transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, symmetrical reflection of the dragonfly visible on the water surface directly beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly is shown hovering above the water surface, with a discernible symmetrical reflection mirrored directly below, similar to the optical effect observed in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water surface calm and reflective, with small sparkling particles scattered across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water surface in Image B is smooth and reflective, akin to Image A, and is dotted with small sparkling particles, suggesting a calm appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dragonfly hovering just above the water surface, with its body parallel to the water plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragonfly in Image B, as well as in Image A, is positioned just above the water surface. Its body appears almost parallel to the water surface, denoting a consistent depiction across both images.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bright, diffused light source in the upper center of the image, casting a golden glow through the green foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any warm, golden glow. Instead, the image is suffused with cool, blue tones without any distinct light source emulating the warm tones of sunlight.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there slender green stems and leafy structures extending from the water, supporting the pink-red flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flower and plant structures in Image B are blue, and the stems do not reflect the green hue observed in Image A, indicating an alteration in color but retaining structural similarities.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is depicted with a cool blue palette, differing from the green foliage with sunlight patches visible in Image A, thus altering the visual presentation of the background.",
