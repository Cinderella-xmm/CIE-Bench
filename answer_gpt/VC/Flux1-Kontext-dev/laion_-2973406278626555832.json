    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the vape device is presented within a comic illustration. The transparent tank section is an integral part of both the visual representation and the description provided in the infographic, which includes labeled sections depicting the internal liquid levels within the transparent tank segment, making it visible to the viewer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the vape device present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the depicted vape device is distinct and appropriately outlined in the graphic section. The mouthpiece is visibly positioned at the top of the device illustration, in accordance with industry-standard designs of such equipment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights the coil component within the device's structure in a schematic internal view. However, the coil is not labeled or visually depicted as being situated at the base seen through a transparent tank. Instead, it appears to be part of an internal diagrammatic structure, indicating it may not be at the base visible through the transparent section.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the liquid inside the transparent tank clearly visible and present at a measurable level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the vape device, including a section showing the internal structure where a liquid tank is visibly referenced. The liquid level is adequately depicted, giving an indication of its presence at a measurable capacity within the transparent section designed for this function.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the internal components are depicted in a schematic illustration that visually indicates the coil, liquid, and battery in a vertical alignment. This alignment is consistent with the typical design structure mentioned in the graphic content, supporting the observation of logical vertical arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is an airflow pathway indicated or implied in the deviceâ€™s structure, such as an inlet near the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airflow pathway is suggested in Image B by referring to an inlet positioned near the base of the device schematic. The graphic presentation and labeling depict an airflow concept, which is integral to the operation of such devices, thus indicating its inclusion in this design.",
