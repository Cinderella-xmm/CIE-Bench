      "question": "Do the apples retain their vibrant red color with white speckles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apples are clearly visible, exhibiting a vibrant red color with distinct white speckles. This can be observed through the rich, saturated red tone and the evenly distributed small white spots, which are characteristic of certain apple varieties. The visual information indicates that the color and pattern have been successfully retained.",

      "question": "Are the apples shown with a smooth, shiny texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the apples with a glossy sheen, which is typically indicative of a smooth, shiny texture. This appearance is characterized by the bright highlights and reflections on the surface of the apples, which suggest that the texture is both smooth and reflective.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is natural light visible, creating realistic reflections on the apple surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apples exhibit realistic reflections and highlights, suggesting the presence of natural light. These reflections and the play of light enhance the three-dimensional appearance of the apples, indicating an interaction with a natural light source.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table's surface lacks the visible grain and texture typical of wood, suggesting that the image does not retain the rustic wooden texture from Image A. Instead, the setting appears more uniform and does not evoke the same tactile richness.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain light tone without any details or blur that would suggest natural greenery. It lacks the depth and color variation that a background with natural greenery would exhibit.",
