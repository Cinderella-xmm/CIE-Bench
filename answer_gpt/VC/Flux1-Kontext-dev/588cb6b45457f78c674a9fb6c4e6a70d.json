    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the facial features are obscured, making it impossible to determine their position, orientation, or symmetry. Therefore, the position of the eyes, their slant, and gaze direction cannot be assessed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the nose have a straight bridge and a slightly rounded tip, aligned centrally between the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Again, due to the blurred face, the specific characteristics of the nose, such as its bridge and tip, cannot be evaluated. Determining alignment relative to the eyes is also not possible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lips and any expression they might convey are indiscernible due to the blurring effect on the face, making it impossible to describe their form or expression.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportionality and symmetry of facial features are not assessable owing to the blurred area covering the relevant regions on the face.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the left ear is visible and emerges under the hat and hair as part of the decorative element, but it is not under the hair near the temple as traditional anatomy would suggest.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to facial blurring, shadows along specific facial features cannot be evaluated. Lighting effects on the face are indiscernible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the head centered above the shoulders, with no unnatural tilt or rotation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visually, the head appears centered above the shoulders, with no evident tilt or rotation, given the position of the clothing and the symmetrical design elements around the neck area.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
