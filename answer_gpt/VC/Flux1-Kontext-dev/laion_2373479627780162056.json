    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject’s beard and mustache present and white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's beard and mustache are visible and white in color. This can be identified by the clear delineation of facial hair that contrasts with the rest of the skin tone, consistent with how a white beard would appear against a lighter background.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have short, graying white hair with a visible receding hairline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair of the subject appears to be short and white with a receding hairline, suggesting signs of aging consistent with graying hair. This is visible through the hairstyle and hair color, which aligns with typical indications of graying hair due to age.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject’s mouth slightly open, indicating speech?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject’s mouth cannot be evaluated for indicators of speech due to the blurring in Image B, leaving no clear view of the mouth area to determine if it is open. Thus, based solely on what can be observed, any claim about the subject's mouth position is speculative.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted wearing a dark suit jacket over a white dress shirt. The jacket's darker color and the contrast with the white shirt indicate formal attire, which is typically observed in professional settings.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tie is visible at the subject's neck, and it appears to be knotted in a conventional manner. This is discernible from the visible red tie and its placement at the collar, suggesting a standard tie knot, which is common in such attire.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the subject’s eyes positioned symmetrically, with visible wrinkles around them, and a prominent nose and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features such as the eyes, wrinkles, nose, and jawline cannot be assessed in Image B due to the face being blurred. Thus, these details regarding symmetry and prominence are not visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the face illuminated from the front-right, casting subtle shadows on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blur covering the face area in Image B, the direction of facial illumination and the shadow specifics cannot be precisely distinguished. Therefore, any statement about lighting effects or shadow placement on the face is conjectural.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
