    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cactus still spherical in overall shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus has a rounded shape with consistent proportions, maintaining a typical spherical appearance. The visual cues show symmetry and balance, which are characteristic of a spherical form. By applying world knowledge, cacti can often have round shapes, especially in pots, which supports the observation that it is spherical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical ribs of the cactus clearly visible and maintaining their segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical ribs are clearly visible, running from top to bottom, and appear prominently segmented. The structure is similar to many cacti, which have ribs that help in water retention and minimize surface area for water loss. These visual elements suggest that the ribs maintain their traditional segmented pattern.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the main body of the cactus still predominantly green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary color of the cactus's main body is a vibrant green. Despite additional features like crystals and gems, the fundamental color remains consistent with typical cactus coloring. Recognizing green as a common color for plant tissue, one can conclude that the primary color of the cactus remains green.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cactus positioned vertically and resting on a flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cactus upright, rooted in its container, with the container itself resting on a flat desert surface. This vertical alignment is consistent with how potted plants are typically presented for balance and nutrient absorption from the surrounding soil.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a textured, flat surface beneath the cactus container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is set against a sandy landscape, which is not flat in texture; rather, it is likely uneven, typical of a desert environment. Since the image depicts a natural setting, the lack of a visibly flat, artificial surface suggests there isnâ€™t a textured flat surface as in Image A's wooden table.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cactus placed directly above a supporting structure (such as a pedestal or pot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cactus in Image B is situated within a clay pot, evident by the visible pot structure underneath the cactus body. This position follows conventional planting methods where the pot acts as the supporting structure, maintaining stability and holding soil for the cactus.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to come from the upper left side, given the shading on the right side of the cactus pot. The highlights and shadows suggest that the light source is indeed from the upper left, casting shadows consistent with that position.",
