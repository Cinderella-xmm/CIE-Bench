      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the leaf in the edited image still ovate with a pointed tip and serrated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the leaf retains its ovate shape, pointed tip, and serrated edges. Its form is clearly visible within the glass sphere, and these features are consistent with a typical leaf shape and structure, indicating that its physical characteristics have been preserved.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain the prominent central vein with branching secondary veins forming a network across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf's surface details are still discernible, showcasing the central vein and the branching secondary veins. The leaf appears to maintain these natural features effectively, as veins contribute to the leaf's structural anatomy and are visible through the transparent sphere, assisting in the realistic depiction of the leaf.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leaf still golden-yellow with visible brown speckles and natural discolorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the leaf enclosed in a glass sphere, maintaining its golden-yellow coloration and showing small brown speckles and discolorations. These features are common in leaves and are clearly visible, suggesting that the leaf's coloration and natural patterns are intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain its papery texture and minor surface imperfections such as blemishes or spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf's texture and surface imperfections, including blemishes or spots, are preserved and visible through the glass sphere. This textural depiction provides realism, indicating that the leaf's actual characteristics are retained post-editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf oriented with the stem pointing toward the upper left and the blade extending diagonally across the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the leaf with its stem oriented toward the upper left and the blade angled diagonally across the sphere. This positioning contributes to the composition within the spherical setting, ensuring the leaf's original orientation is preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the leaf the sole central object in the edited image, without any other competing elements in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the leaf is embraced by the glass sphere, making it the central object of focus. Although the sphere adds an element to the image, it serves as a framing enclosure rather than a competing object, ensuring that the leaf remains the main subject.",
