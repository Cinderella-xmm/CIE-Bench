      "question": "Are the elephant's tusks present and curved outward in a natural arc, extending from the mouth and tapering toward the tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is shown as part of a scene inside a box. The visual cues show elephant tusks that are elegantly curved and taper toward the tips, which is consistent with how an elephant’s tusks naturally appear. The tusks extend outward from the mouth in an arc, which is characteristic of a real elephant.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the elephant's skin display deep, wrinkled folds across the forehead, neck, and body, consistent with natural elephant dermatology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the elephant’s modeled skin is detailed with etched lines and ridges that mimic the deep, wrinkled texture typical of elephant skin. Such dermatological features are present across the elephant's body, giving it a realistic appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an acacia tree that has a broad, flat canopy and horizontal branches. This is consistent with the distinctive shape of acacia trees, which typically have wide, umbrella-like canopies often seen in African landscapes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the foreground covered in tall, golden-yellow grass blades that extend upward and show subtle motion from wind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground consists of a miniature representation within a box. The grass appears as short tufts rather than tall, waving blades. It lacks the appearance of wind-swept motion that would be characteristic of natural tall grass in a savannah setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are snow-capped mountains visible in the background, forming a distant ridge line behind the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a backdrop inside the box that includes tiny depictions of mountains. These mountains have snow caps and form a distant ridge line scene just like real snow-capped mountains, creating a picturesque setting behind the elephant.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elephant's trunk curled at the tip and showing segmented ridges along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the elephant's trunk design features a gentle curl at the tip and shows segmented texture, portraying the characteristic ridges that are typical of an elephant's trunk.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the elephant's ears have a large, broad, fan-shaped outline with visible internal folds and a downward flare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s ears are sculpted to have large, fan-like shapes with detailed ridges that suggest internal folds. They have a slight downward flare, consistent with the natural appearance of elephant ears.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the lighting within the box seems to originate from the front rather than any particular angle like upper left. This results in even illumination, and does not produce distinct shadows on the elephant or the grass that would suggest a specific direction of light.",
