        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap still appears on the man's head, similar to the design and position observed in Image A, indicating it maintains its original shape and position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a gray cap, but the small brown leather tag is not visible, whereas Image A shows the tag. Thus, in Image B, the tag is absent.",

    {

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is wearing a black suit and tie, differing significantly from Image A, where he wears a heather gray crew-neck t-shirt. Therefore, the attire has changed in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's facial hair details are unclear due to the blur, while Image A shows more visible skin without facial hair. Based on the blurred area, no distinct mustache or goatee is apparent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A clearly shows the man facing to the left in a side profile. In Image B, the silhouette suggests a frontal view, indicated by the forward placement of the body and 'The Gray Mystery' poster style. Thus, the direction has changed.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A displays a heather gray fabric texture on the cap and shirt, while Image B shows more uniform coloring, especially noticeable in the cap. The shirt is absent, replaced by a suit, which does not display heather gray characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap appears to be positioned in a natural manner on the man's head, similar to Image A, which suggests the cap's alignment is preserved.",
