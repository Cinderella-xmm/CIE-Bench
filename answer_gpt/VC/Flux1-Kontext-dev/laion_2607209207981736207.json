    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Fujitsu fi-7160\" model name and logo visibly present on the top-left portion of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region where the model name and logo are usually located is visually analyzed. This space is taken by more stylized graphics, which suggests a futuristic or tech-oriented theme. Comparing with Image A, where 'Fujitsu fi-7160' is clearly seen on the top-left, the absence of this detail in Image B is noticeable.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray open and holding multiple documents, including a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip, in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an ADF tray that is indeed open with multiple documents visible, including paper-shaped items resembling a boarding pass, receipt, and payment slip. Comparing this appearance to Image A, which also shows documents in the ADF tray, confirms their presence.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five control buttons (Menu, Stop/Clear, Scan/Enter, Power, and directional navigation) arranged in the same configuration on the right side of the scanner in the holographic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the holographic display shows an area resembling buttons similar to those in Image A. Although they are stylized with holographic effects, their layout appears consistent with the arrangement seen in Image A, indicating unchanged positioning.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the power button on the scanner's control panel exhibits green illumination. In Image A, the same button also shows green illumination, suggesting that this feature has been maintained in the holographic representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, assessing beneath the scanning bed, there is a visible row of objects resembling bristle rollers, presented in a stylized form. Image A features actual bristle rollers in the same region, confirming their depiction in the holographic style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows documents in the ADF tray, which appear blurred or stylized as part of the holographic theme, making them unreadable. In Image A, these documents possess clear, readable text which is absent in Image B's holographic depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's depiction uses a blue holographic overlay that alters the visual color scheme from the black and light gray seen in Image A. The distinctive original color combination is replaced by the stylized holographic design, indicating a change.",
