    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red roof of the house located on the left side of the peninsula still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground has been significantly altered and a large dragon is present near the water's edge. The red-roofed house visible on the left side of the peninsula in Image A is no longer visible in Image B. Therefore, the red roof is not present in the edited Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the long black building situated near the center-right of the peninsula still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily features a dragon and a visually altered landscape without the structures visible in Image A, including the long black building. The focus on the dragon suggests that other elements, like the black building, are not retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the golden-brown grasslands covering the peninsula still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can identify the dragon standing on the golden-brown grasslands that cover the landscape. Despite changes in other elements, the grasslands maintain their presence and color.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are patches of ice visible on the surface of the lake in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake is visible but appears to be a consistent surface with no ice patches. In Image A, patches of ice were distinct. The edited image does not include these ice patches.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are snow streaks visible running down the slopes of the mountains in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both in Image A and Image B, the mountains in the background reveal snow streaks running down the slopes. This indicates that this feature of the landscape remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the red-roofed house positioned to the left of the black barn along the peninsula?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither the red-roofed house nor the black barn are visible. Considering their absence, the positioning of these structures cannot be confirmed in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image retain the original color scheme of blue sky, white snow, brown grass, and red roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky maintains its blue color, and the white snow on the mountains persists. The grass continues to be brown. However, the red roof is not present in Image B due to the removal of structures associated with it. Hence, the full original color scheme is not retained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the peninsula shaped in a winding, snake-like curve extending from the shore into the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terrain and peninsula have been styled differently to accommodate the dragon's presence. The winding, snake-like curve seen in Image A is adjusted or obscured in Image B.",
