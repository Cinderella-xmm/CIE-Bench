      "question": "Does the edited image retain the hippo's large size and wrinkled skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo maintains its large size relative to the rabbit, which is indicative of hippos in general, known for their larger sizes. Additionally, the hippo's skin texture appears smooth and cartoon-like in the edited image, diverging from the natural wrinkled texture visible in Image A. This suggests that Image B does not retain the detailed skin texture of the hippo. Therefore, while the size is preserved, the skin texture is not.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the rabbit's small size and upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rabbit is depicted as small and maintains upright ears, which are characteristic features of rabbits. The cartoon-like representation does not alter the fundamental size and ear position. Comparing with Image A, where the rabbit is small and has upright ears, the edited image preserves these characteristics.",

      "question": "Does the edited image keep the hippo and rabbit positioned close together and oriented towards the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, both the hippo and cartoon rabbit are shown in close proximity, similar to Image A. Their orientation towards the viewer is maintained in the cartoon rendering of Image B, similar to the orientation present in Image A. Therefore, the edited image retains their positioning and orientation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo and rabbit are portrayed in a cartoon style that suggests a calm demeanor, inferred from their neutral facial expressions and relaxed pose. In Image A, both animals also appear calm due to their lying and sitting positions, respectively. Thus, the edited image retains the calm demeanor of both animals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tones have shifted to more vibrant and cartoon-like colors, with a noticeable absence of earthy tones that are prevalent in Image A, where the natural environment consists of browns and muted colors. The edited image uses brighter colors typical of animated settings rather than natural earth tones.",
