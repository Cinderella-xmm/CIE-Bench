    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cake round in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake appears circular in the edited pop-art style, indicated by the consistent curvature portrayed around its perimeter. The shape resembles a typical round cake on top of a pedestal, which matches common cake visuals and shapes, consistent with universal cake design knowledge where round shapes are predominant.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there exactly one candle on top of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a single vertical element on top of the cake representing a candle, characterized by its slender form with the flame at the top which aligns with standard candle representations. This singular depiction, paired with common cake presentations, concludes the presence of one candle only.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cake placed on a raised stand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake in Image B is shown elevated above the table surface with the support of a discernible structure beneath it, identified as a stand. This elevates the cake and matches general presentation norms for cakes where stands are used for aesthetic display which illustrates the raised placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a vase with coral-pink fluffy flowers on the left side of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features distinct shapes to the left of the cake emblematic of a vase containing visually fluffy objects that take on a coral-pink hue. These shapes appear consistent with representations of floral arrangements as general vase compositions often depict flowers naturally, correlating with coral-pink floral characteristics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there multiple colored balloons floating above the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a collection of rounded shapes grouped together each expressed in varied colors, extending above the cake which mirror balloon characteristics in both style and typical celebratory positioning. This aligns with typical celebrations and balloon groupings, confirming multiple colored balloons presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small floral decorations (one purple and one green) on top of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't incorporate clear shapes indicative of varied floral elements directly atop the cake. The top portion of the cake misses distinct color variation to signify floral hierarchy often visualized in celebratory cakes, so this detail is absent in the analyzed image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there chopsticks and small bowls of red candies on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates shapes positioned on the table consistent with the form and layout of chopsticks alongside small dish structures containing red spherical elements. These resemble typical bowls of candy setups commonly found in celebratory environments, pointing to their presence in this artistic rendition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a traditional East Asian-style building visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks evident structural delineations or typical architectural styling indicative of East Asian buildings which would appear through known configurations like tiled roofs or ornate detailing. The visual style predominantly uses pattern dots without conveying explicit architectural themes present in the original image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
