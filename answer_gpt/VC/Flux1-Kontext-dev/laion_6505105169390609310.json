      "question": "Is the gold crown present on the head of each of the three figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the three figures is clearly wearing a gold crown. This is visible as it is prominent on the top of their heads, indicating a status of royalty or importance. This conclusion is drawn from the visual representation of the crowns and their positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all three figures have prominent dark beards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two of the figures have visible dark beards—this is typically depicted in religious or royal imagery indicating wise men. The central figure does not have a visible beard from the angle presented. The analysis is based on the representation of facial hair which is noticeable for the other two figures.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the robes of the figures colored in purple/green, red/white/gold, and green/blue respectively, with gold trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the three figures dressed in colorful robes. The robes are identified as purple/green on the left, red/white/gold on the central figure, and green/blue on the right. Gold trim is visible on all robes, aligned with typical ornate dress for figures of importance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each figure hold a golden object (vessel, box, or orb)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all figures are holding golden objects. The left figure holds a vessel-like shape, the central figure’s hand gesture could imply holding at chest height, and the right figure holds what resembles a box. The inference is drawn from recognizing the symbolic presentation of gifts by these figures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the hands of the central figure clasped over the chest, and do the other two figures hold their gifts with both hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure's hands are clasped over the chest, which is traditionally a sign of reverence or prayer. The other two figures are holding their golden objects with both hands, which suggests care or a display gesture. This understanding is based on visual cues of hand position and cultural knowledge.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the central figure noticeably smaller than the other two, and is he standing upright with hands clasped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is kneeling, not standing upright, and is noticeably smaller in height compared to the other two figures. The kneeling posture is evidenced by the bent knees and the base structure apparent around the feet area suggesting lower positioning. This posture analysis requires understanding typical representation in such imagery.",
