      "question": "Is the circular logo featuring a navy blue \"C\" shape with a red semicircle at the top present on the front of the energy drink can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, I can identify a circular logo with a navy blue 'C' shape and a red semicircle at the top; this is visible prominently on the shoe, which is incorporated into the design of the can on the front. Given the edited nature of the image and considering how logos are often emphasized in branding, it's logical to expect this logo to be clearly visible on the edited item.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the energy drink can feature the navy blue mesh texture across its main body surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the shoe has a navy blue mesh texture visible on its upper portion. A section of the shoe with this texture is prominently edited onto the drink can. However, the mesh pattern does not cover the main body of the can; the can mostly retains a solid navy color, suggesting the texture is part of the shoe design, not the can surface.",

      "question": "Are the navy blue laces depicted as raised embossed ridges wrapping around the middle section of the can in their original crisscross pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents navy blue laces that are part of the shoe edited into the can design, maintaining their original crisscross pattern. In this edited image, these laces appear as flat graphics rather than raised embossed ridges, as there is no evident three-dimensional aspect to them on the can's surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are three navy blue stripes arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the can, matching the original shoe's stripe layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an integral part of the shoe's design with navy blue stripes integrated into the can's appearance. However, upon examining closely, these stripes do not maintain a horizontal arrangement; they follow the shoe's angle and orientation. Therefore, the horizontal layout from the original shoe's lower portion is not directly replicated on the can.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" displayed in red lettering on the upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B features the word 'Kickstart' prominently styled in red lettering near the top of the can. Using world knowledge of branding design, the emphasis on bright colors against a navy backdrop ensures visibility and aligns with typical branding strategies to highlight product names.",
