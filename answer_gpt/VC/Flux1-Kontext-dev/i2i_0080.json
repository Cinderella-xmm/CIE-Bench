      "question": "Does the dog retain its reddish-brown fur in both the left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted sitting on the bed with two views: a side view from the left and a back view. In both views, the dog features a consistent reddish-brown color. This consistency showcases that the dog's fur color does not change across different perspectives. This is a common illustration technique where animals retain their fur color irrespective of the view unless intentionally altered. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Are the dog’s floppy ears present and maintained in shape in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is shown with floppy ears in both the left side view and the back view. The ears fall downwards in the same manner, characteristic of floppy dog ears as commonly depicted in animations. The constancy of the ear shape in different views indicates that the ears are consistently rendered within the image. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Is the dog wearing a red collar with a tag in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is seen wearing a red collar with a tag in both depicted views. The side view clearly shows the collar and tag around the dog's neck. The back view supports the presence of the collar as it is visibly snug around the neck, maintaining the uniform elements of the dog's attire. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Is the dog still lying on a wooden bed with a green mattress and pillow in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted in a sitting posture rather than lying down, on a wooden bed with a green mattress and pillow. The structural content like the bed frame and bedding materials remain unchanged from Image A, except for the dog's pose. Therefore, even though the position has changed, the essentials of the bed setup have not. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Is the dog’s bed set against a pale blue background with green grass around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting displays a pale blue background and green grass surrounding the wooden bed, similar to pastoral illustrations where simple environmental backgrounds are used. This choice of color and setting remains consistent with Image A, showing no change in background elements. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
