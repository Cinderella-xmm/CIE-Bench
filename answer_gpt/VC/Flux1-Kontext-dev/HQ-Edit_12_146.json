        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the face is blurred in Image B, assessing the direction of the gaze is not feasible. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude the direction the subject is looking.",
