    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid appears to be transformed into a creature with a robotic appearance. Its surface is textured with green elements resembling moss or vegetation, indicative of an overgrown look, rather than retaining the original stone texture with weathering patterns found in historical pyramids. This suggests a departure from the grayish stone texture described.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a pyramidal head but it does not retain a flat, rectangular top platform typical of pyramids. Instead, the creature's pyramidal head seamlessly integrates into its body, lacking defined edges of a traditional pyramid's top.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pyramidal creature that does not feature a staircase. The pyramid design turns into armor-like plates on the creature without the central staircase seen on traditional pyramids.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any distinct tiers of a pyramid structure decreasing in size from bottom to top. The creature's design resembles a pyramid but lacks distinct tiers, instead featuring segmented armor plates.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a creature whose surface appears overgrown with moss and vegetation, especially on its pyramidal head and armor plates. This simulates natural overgrowth typically seen on neglected structures, aligning with the description.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to illuminate the creature with a subtle beam from the upper left, creating shadows consistent with this direction. However, the image focuses mostly on the creature rather than casting a clear, distinct shadow that can be compared directly to pyramid shadows in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the pyramid creature within a lush, dark forest environment. The dense vegetation and forest surround the creature, matching the description of a tropical jungle setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On Image B's creature, the 'head' does not clearly display a flat platform characteristic of pyramid tops, but it has a surface covered by moss, indicating overgrowth. However, aspects like dry soil are not visibly distinct due to the fictional depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any vehicles. The focus is on a single pyramidal creature and its environment, without recognizable vehicles at its base, contrasting Image A which potentially includes such elements.",
