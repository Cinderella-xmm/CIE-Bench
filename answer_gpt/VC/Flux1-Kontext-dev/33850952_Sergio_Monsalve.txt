    "Question": "Q1: Are there at least eight distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically along the building facade?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building facade appears to have several distinct levels, but upon counting each visible horizontal division, it becomes clear that there are seven such levels. These levels are discernible by their distinguishable horizontal separation, which is prominent due to the blue glow of the windows. Thus, there aren't at least eight distinct horizontal levels; it stops at seven.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a transparent railing structure visible on each balcony, positioned directly outside the windows?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a fantastical structure with tentacle-like elements wrapping around it. While there are sections of the building that appear similar to balconies, they do not exhibit visible transparent railing structures as seen in conventional architecture. The 'balconies' are not distinctly separate from the organism-like textures that envelop them, nor is there a typical usage of glass railings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the windows on each floor arranged in a continuous, curved arc along the building’s surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure displays windows with curved shapes that appear artsy and organic. Due to the tentacle-like extensions, the windows give a sensation of a wavy, flowing form, aligning with the curved arcs description. These curves are continuous and follow the undulating pattern of the building's unique facade.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Can furniture items (such as chairs or tables) be seen inside the rooms through the windows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the translucent blue glow coming from the windows prevents any clear view into the interior spaces. There are no visible furniture items; the reflections and opacity of the glow obscure any possibility of identifying interior objects such as chairs or tables.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the building viewed from a low-angle side perspective, showing its height and curving profile?",
    "explanation": "Image B is depicted from a perspective that captures the full side of the building, enhancing its height and showcasing the unique curving profile of the facade. This view is low-angle, emphasizing the structure’s towering presence and its twisted, surreal elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does each window have a corresponding balcony immediately outside it, aligned horizontally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while there are structures that might resemble balconies, the arrangement is inconsistently aligned due to the tentacle-like design embracing the building. These organic elements interrupt any typical architectural horizontal uniformity, and thus these supposed balconies do not align horizontally with the windows in a conventional manner.",
    "answer": "No"
