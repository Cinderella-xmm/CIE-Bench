      "question": "Is the crocodile's snout with two visible teeth present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the snout of the crocodile is stylized and simplified in a pop art style, but there is still a discernible artistic representation of two teeth along the lower jaw. Despite the abstract nature of the image, the design still suggests the presence of teeth, which is consistent with the depiction of crocodiles in art. Therefore, by observing the lines and shapes in Image B, combined with common knowledge of crocodile anatomy, the snout with two teeth is present.",

      "question": "Is the colorful knitted hat with a red pom-pom still present on the crocodile's head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is depicted with a hat, which is rendered in a variety of bright colors, similar to the colors seen in Image A. The red pom-pom is still present at the top of the hat, maintaining the defining characteristics of a colorful knitted hat. The presence of these elements can be confirmed through visual analysis of the shapes and colors depicted in the edited pop art image.",

      "question": "Are the orange-framed sunglasses with reflective lenses still positioned over the crocodile's eyes in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile wears sunglasses that are depicted with a similar shape to the original image, albeit with strong pop art stylization. The sunglasses retain an outline suggestive of frames in a distinctly bold color, resembling orange, which aligns with the original color scheme. Although the pop art style uses flat color blocks, the essence of the orange frames and their position over the eyes is preserved in the stylized form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crocodile's head oriented forward with a slight leftward turn in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the crocodile's head suggests an orientation that, while simplified and stylized, visually resembles a forward-facing direction with a slight leftward turn. This orientation is reflected in the way the details are positioned relative to the center of its form, such as the eye placement and the snout direction in the pop art style.",

      "question": "Is the crocodile partially submerged in water in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, rendered in a bold and abstract pop art style, doesn't depict any form of water or water-like element. The background is composed of solid colors and geometric shapes entirely different from water representation. Therefore, based solely on visual cues and the lack of aqueous elements typically seen in water representation, the crocodile is not shown as partially submerged in water in the edited version.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there reflections visible in the lenses of the sunglasses in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the pop art style employs flat color fields without rendered reflection or glint-like detail on the sunglasses that would typically indicate reflections as seen in more realistic art styles. Therefore, due to the nature of the pop art rendering which eschews reflections, there are no visible reflections in the lenses of the sunglasses.",
