      "question": "Does the edited image retain the curly, voluminous dark brown hair with visible wave patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hair appears stylized and simplified compared to Image A. Despite this, it retains some elements of volume and curliness. Image B's hair is consistent with chibi design, which often features simplified anatomical details. Given the constraints of chibi design, Image B does preserve the essential aspects of curly, volumetric hair, allowing viewers to recognize the character's hairstyle.",

      "question": "Are the broad shoulder pauldrons with their intricate engraved patterns still present and recognizable in the keychain version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays shoulder armor that is characterized by notable broadness, confirming the presence of pauldrons. The intricate patterns have been simplified but still feature recognizable design elements. This suggests a stylized portrayal typical of chibi adaptations, keeping the spirit of the original intricate patterns observable in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the deep red cloak still draped over the shoulders and visible in the keychain design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase a deep red cloak over the shoulders as seen in Image A. In chibi design adaptations, certain elements may be omitted for simplicity and emphasis on other traits. This omission indicates a departure from the original design's details to accommodate chibi style constraints.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the character’s blue eyes clearly visible and retained in the same position on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is blurred, making the blue eyes unobservable. Without visibility of the eyes, it cannot be assessed whether the eyes are retained or remain in the original position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collar is visible around the neck, demonstrating a lower but present structure compared to Image A. The decorative edges are simplified yet remain discernible, typical of chibi adaptations that focus on iconic elements. This reflects the presence of the collar element.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest armor design reflects stylization with simplified engraved patterns and a noticeable central motif. While the complexity is reduced compared to Image A, the essence of symmetrical designs and central decoration is retained, which is typical in chibi adaptations focusing on core design aspects.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, obscuring assessment of facial features, such as the jawline, nose shape, and cheekbone structure. Without visibility of these elements, it cannot be assessed if they retain the original structure.",
