      "question": "Are all the original fruit types (pineapple, kiwi, pear, watermelon, orange, banana, and blueberries) retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a visual inspection shows the presence of all listed fruits: pineapple, kiwi, pear, watermelon, orange, banana, and blueberries. Each fruit is identifiable by its distinct appearance and color. The pineapple has a yellow hue, kiwi is green, pear sections are light green, watermelon is red with a green rind, oranges are bright orange, bananas are pale yellow, and blueberries are deep blue. Using common fruit characteristics helps confirm that all fruit types are present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original colors of the fruits (yellow, green, red, orange, and purple) preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (B) maintains the distinct colors of the fruits. Pineapple is yellow, kiwi is green, watermelon is red with green rind, oranges are orange, bananas are light yellow, and blueberries are purple/blue. Each fruit retains its natural color, which is consistent with common knowledge about their appearances.",

      "question": "Is the cross-section texture of the kiwi and the seed pattern of the watermelon retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kiwi displays the characteristic cross-sectional seed pattern, with seeds in a row surrounded by green flesh, and the watermelon shows the common seed pattern scattered within the red flesh. These patterns are typical for these fruits and are preserved in the edited image, confirming their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image B to Image A, the arrangement of fruits—banana at the front, followed by oranges, blueberries, pineapple, kiwi, pear, and watermelon—is unchanged. The relative positioning of each fruit type seems consistent, suggesting that the arrangement is preserved in the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image still shows the white plate holding the fruits. The golden tray underneath the plate is also visible. Despite the additional elements like green leaves on the image, these original elements remain intact and visible.",
