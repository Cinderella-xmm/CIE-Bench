      "question": "Does the bear retain its brown fur texture and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear appears to have a brown fur color that matches common characteristics of bears, specifically brown bears. While the texture is smooth, it lacks the detailed fur texture typically found in real animals, suggesting a more stylized or cartoonish representation. Using common knowledge of bear appearances, this bear still visually retains a semblance of both color and texture as expected. Thus, based on visual cues, the bear keeps its brown fur color, although stylistically different.",

      "question": "Is the bear depicted in an upright sitting posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is in a sitting position, where its legs are placed flat against the surface, similar to how a bear would sit upright. This aligns with the common understanding of bears' capabilities to sit in such postures. Looking at the positioning of its body and legs, the bear seems to be sitting in an upright manner, indicative of an alert and balanced sitting posture.",

      "question": "Does the backpack retain its blue color and black straps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is blue and features black straps. These visual features are consistent with widely-known backpack designs and coloring options, where blue is a common primary color and black is used for straps or buckles. Based on these observable details, the backpack maintains its blue color with black straps.",

      "question": "Are the backpack's black straps and buckles visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the Image B, the backpack displays black straps and a buckle on the front. These components appear intact and are part of the auditory cues for typical backpack design elements, which suggest functionality. Observing the straps' complete form and the presence of a buckle that appears usable and embedded in its original position confirms that these features are visually intact.",

      "question": "Does the bear retain its dark eyes, black nose, and rounded ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the face of the bear is blurred, the visible parts suggest the bear retains characteristics such as rounded ears as indicated by their shape and position. Typical bear features include dark eyes and black nose, which contribute to the classic appearance, and based on typical bear characteristics these features can be inferred to remain consistent, although they are obscured by the face blur.",
