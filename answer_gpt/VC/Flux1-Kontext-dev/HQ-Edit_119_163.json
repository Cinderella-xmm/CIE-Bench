    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the embossed dragons with detailed scales, claws, and flowing bodies clearly visible on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a cylindrical container, not a teapot. The cylindrical container has an engraved foliage pattern along its body. There are no dragons visible on this object. Thus, the description of embossed dragons does not match with the motifs seen on Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the object textured with raised relief patterns, particularly around the dragon motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B does feature raised relief patterns, but these are of plant motifs, not dragons. The texturing exists, but it is characterized by foliage design rather than dragon figures. Therefore, the specific question about dragon motifs doesn't apply here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spout extending from the side of the object, shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cylindrical container and there is no visible spout extending from its side. The object is not a teapot and does not have any dragon-head shaped spout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the object retain a silver-colored, highly reflective metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical object does have a silver-colored, metallic surface that appears to be quite reflective. The shiny nature of the metallic finish is consistent with a silver-like appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cylindrical container standing upright on a flat wooden surface, which appears to be a table. The object's position is clearly upright and stable.",
