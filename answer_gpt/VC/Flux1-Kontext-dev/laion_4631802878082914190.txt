    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain exactly six labeled process stages corresponding to the CRISP-DM phases?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters and elements are illustrated in a playful manner with various animal characters. The stages that are labeled are: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparing (misspelt Preparation), Modeling, and Evaluation on banners or signs. However, Deployment is missing, leading to the conclusion that there are only five stages depicted. The sixth stage of Deployment is absent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the six stages arranged in the correct sequential order: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the first five stages are arranged in the sequence Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparing → Modeling → Evaluation, the Deployment stage is missing, breaking the correct CRISP-DM sequence.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Business Understanding' and 'Data Understanding' stages?",
    "explanation": "In the Image B, there is a clear arrow connecting 'Business Understanding' to 'Data Understanding' and vice versa, indicating a bidirectional connection between these two stages.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the 'Data Preparation' and 'Modeling' stages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a visual inspection shows that there is no visible bidirectional connection between 'Data Preparing' and 'Modeling'. Thus, there is no mutual interaction depicted between these two stages.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a central data source located at the center of the diagram, accessible to all six stages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a central depiction of a database at the center labeled as 'Data'. However, it is not explicitly shown to be accessible to all stages because the stages are not interconnected through a visible route to the central data source.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the diagram include a clear return path from the 'Deployment' stage back to the 'Business Understanding' stage, completing the cycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no 'Deployment' stage depicted, and thus there cannot be any return path from this nonexistent stage back to 'Business Understanding'. The cycle appears incomplete as a result.",
    "answer": "No"
}
