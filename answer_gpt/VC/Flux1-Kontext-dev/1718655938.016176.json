        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steeple of the church has a pointed design typical of many churches. At the very top of the steeple, there is a distinct cross visible in the image. This visual information, paired with common knowledge about church architecture, where a cross is often placed at the highest point of the steeple, allows us to conclude that there is indeed a cross at the top.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front center of the church features a doorway with an arched shape, typical of ecclesiastical architecture.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a dirt path is clearly visible starting from the foreground and winding its way toward the entrance of the church.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on either side of the main doorway, there are no visible windows. Additionally, there is an absence of a visible side window on the church's wall.
