      "question": "Do the nesting dolls maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are shaped as traditional Russian Matryoshka dolls, which have a rounded top and cylindrical body, rather than a triangular shape like the pyramid. Despite the pyramid being in the background and potentially serving as a theme for the dolls’ designs, the dolls themselves do not adopt its triangular structure.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the stone texture seen in the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone texture of the pyramid in Image B is characterized by a rugged, block-like appearance typical of ancient stone structures. In contrast, the nesting dolls have a smooth, painted surface that lacks the rough texture and appearance of carved stone.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls designed with a symmetrical structure similar to the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pyramid in Image B exhibits a symmetrical structure with a balanced, triangular shape and uniform sides. The nesting dolls, while not triangular, maintain their own symmetry characteristic of their shape, with even proportions and mirrored sides along their vertical axis.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nesting dolls placed on the wooden table in clear descending order based on their height, with the largest doll on the left and the smallest on the right, which is the typical arrangement for nested dolls when displayed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The largest nesting doll in Image B features illustrations that reflect the architectural elements of the pyramid, including a depiction that resembles the central entrance of the pyramid. This design choice suggests that the dolls are themed around the pyramid’s structural elements.",
