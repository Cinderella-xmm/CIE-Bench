    "Question": "Q2: Is there a large vertical glass panel or sliding door on the front face of the cabin, emitting warm light?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays an area on the left side of the cabin which seems to be a vertical opening. The visual depiction lacks distinctive transparency or any indication of light emission. It appears to be solid and decorated, rather than transparent or glass.
