      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee collectible clearly shows yellow and black stripes on its body, which are typical and characteristic patterns for cartoon or decorative bees.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the bee collectible are yellow and solid, rather than translucent. Translucent wings would appear see-through or semitransparent, allowing light to pass through partially, potentially showing patterns or objects behind them.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee and flower collectibles are placed horizontally adjacent to each other, indicating they are positioned side by side. This arrangement is visually evident as both collectibles occupy a similar horizontal level within the box, which is a typical display method for complementary items in a set.",

Such text placement suggests branding or theming relevant to the items within. The inscription's visibility aligns with common practices where product names or themes are featured on packaging for decorative effect or identification.",
