    "Question": "Q1: Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle has an embossed compass design on its body. However, the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W are not clearly visible or positioned on this design. This conclusion is drawn by inspecting the details of the embossed pattern which seems to lack the typical direction labels usually found on compasses.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the embossed compass face on the perfume bottle does not exhibit a full 360-degree scale with numerical markings that are evenly spaced at key interval degrees such as 0, 90, 180, and 270. This suggests that the design lacks these specific compass details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
    "explanation": "The embossed compass design on Image B features a radial pattern, but upon closer inspection, it doesn't retain the exact eight-pointed star-like pattern seen in traditional compasses. The arms are not distinctly symmetrical as expected from such designs. This analysis draws from the visual cues that indicate a lack of the conventional star pattern.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compassâ€™s outline?",
    "explanation": "The body of the perfume bottle in Image B appears perfectly circular, closely matching the outline of the original compass in Image A. The analysis focuses on the symmetrical curve and roundness visible in the bottle design, which aligns with the expected shape of the original compass outline.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cap of the perfume bottle, and it does not feature engraved cartographic details like a compass rose or intersecting grid lines. The cap texture appears smooth without the intricate map-like details visible in the map fragments. This deduction is based on a visual inspection and comparison of the surface designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
    "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that there is indeed a central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face on the perfume bottle. This corresponds to the needle pivot seen on traditional compass designs and matches what would be commonly expected in such a layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks a clear delineation of the outer ring on the embossed compass face showing fine engravings and consistently spaced degree marks. The visual cues illustrate a lack of these specific compass detailing characteristics, hence concluding no presence of consistent engraving around the outer ring.",
    "answer": "No"
