      "question": "Does the image retain the orange tabby fur pattern with distinctive stripe markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's fur pattern displays a vibrant orange coloration with clearly visible stripes, typical of an orange tabby. The editing maintains the distinct striped markings commonly associated with this type of coat color. By analyzing the fur textures and colors, which align with tabby characteristics, I can reasonably conclude that the pattern remains consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the kitten's eyes still green with a clear, open expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the kitten with vividly green eyes that appear clear and have an attentive expression. This is determined by the eye color visible in the image; green eyes usually signify a healthy and attentive look in cats. Assessing the direction and openness of the eyes further supports the conclusion that the expression remains unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows the kitten's pink nose, which is a common feature in many cats, along with distinct white whiskers present and prominently displayed. The consistency of the coloration and placement of these features indicate that there has been no alteration to the nose or whiskers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is depicted lying down with its paws stretched forward on a surface, possibly a carpet or rug. This posture is typical for resting cats, allowing for comfort and awareness. The visual cues regarding body position of the kitten match those typical descriptions, ensuring the position remains unchanged.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image continues to showcase a softly blurred background, drawing focus to the kitten prominently in the foreground. This photographic technique enhances the subject by reducing distractions from the background, which remains consistently blurred in Image B.",
