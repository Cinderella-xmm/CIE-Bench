      "question": "Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, through the visual analysis of texture and color pattern on the space suit, the NASA logo is identified clearly on the left shoulder area. The logo's distinct blue, red, and white emblem is recognized based on common understanding of branding. This clarity is essential for identifying the associated organization with the space suit.",

      "question": "Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Through visual inspection of Image B, red bands are clearly visible around the upper arm and lower leg areas of the space suit. The distinct contrast in color compared to the white suit makes these bands noticeable, ensuring their visibility against the suit’s primary color.",

      "question": "Is the white backpack unit attached to the back of the suit, with coiled white hoses extending down the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the white backpack unit is prominently attached to the back of the suit. The bulkiness and positioning suggest typical equipment storage. Coiled white hoses visibly extend from the backpack down the sides, designed for functionality in space travel such as life-support systems.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the helmet’s visor partially raised, revealing part of the astronaut’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet’s visor appears lowered as it doesn’t show any possibility of revealing the astronaut's face. Space helmets feature visors that can be adjusted to protect from light and space conditions, but not revealing the face here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the astronaut in a standing posture leaning slightly backward, oriented to their left side rather than the right side compared to typical upright standing. Recognition of body position and orientation is vital in assessing intended posture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, hoses from the backpack are visually connected to the suit in the torso location. Such a connection indicates a critical life-support integration commonly found in space suits to ensure air and other necessities.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a visual setting where the astronaut stands on a blue surface resembling a tarp. Identification is made by recognizing color and texture that matches common tarp features used in various environments for cleanliness or specific events.",
