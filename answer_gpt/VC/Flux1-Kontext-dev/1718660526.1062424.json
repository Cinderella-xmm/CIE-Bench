      "question": "Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal features an orange body with black stripes in a patterned mosaic design. The stripes are consistently spaced across the body, head, and legs in the same general area as Image A, which is knitted but also has evenly spaced stripes throughout. The mosaic design maintains the overall distribution of stripes seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snout is shown with two distinctly dark circular nostrils symmetrically placed on the upper part of the snout. This reflects a clear definition similar to that of Image A, which also has symmetrically positioned nostrils on the snout, albeit in a knitted format.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are large and circular with white outer rings surrounding black pupils, symmetrically placed on the face. This matches the description in Image A, where the knitted animal similarly featured large, round eyes with white outlines and central black pupils, emphasizing the characteristic design in both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animalâ€™s expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth is depicted as a well-defined curved line below the snout, forming a smile. This is analogous to Image A, where the knitted design also includes a similarly smiling expression, enhancing the friendly appearance of the animal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the animal in a stance suggestive of movement, with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg positioned behind it on the ground. This matches the posture seen in Image A, where the knitted animal is in a similar walking pose, expressing dynamic motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, pointing slightly outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal has two small and rounded ears placed symmetrically on the top of its head, angling slightly towards the outside. Image A similarly possesses these features, albeit in a knitted form, indicating parallel characteristics in ear placement and orientation between both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a surface with a visibly granular, uneven texture resembling natural sand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface shown in Image B is visibly granular and uneven, closely resembling the texture and look of natural sand, much like Image A, which depicts the knitted animal on beach sand integrated with a sunset background. Both images convey a setting akin to natural sandy environments.",
