    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject's face, including the almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and closed mouth with red lips, preserved in the same position and form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face has been blurred, making it impossible to ascertain the presence or position of features such as almond-shaped eyes, a straight nose, or red lips. Since no facial features are visible, the subject's face cannot be said to be preserved in the same position and form as in the original.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the subject’s hair color (reddish-brown) and tightly curled, rounded hairstyle preserved exactly as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is depicted as reddish-brown and styled in a tightly curled, rounded manner. This aligns with historical representations of figures from similar periods and matches the color and style expectations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead preserved in the same location and form?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show a jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead, based on visible detail around where the blur starts. Such elements are typically found in historical portraits of royalty, but their absence or alteration in the image leads to the conclusion that it is not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the right hand positioned on a decorative object (such as a hilt) and the left hand resting on the lap, maintaining the same relative placement and orientation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's right hand is positioned near the hip, possibly resting on or near a part of the dress, while the left hand is at its side. The comparison reveals that the hands are not necessarily oriented towards decorative objects or resting on the lap as might be expected in historical depictions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject’s skin tone (pale with subtle rosy blush on the cheeks) preserved without significant alteration?",
    "explanation": "While precise facial features are indiscernible due to blurring, the visible arm in Image B suggests a pale skin tone. However, without cheek visibility, the presence of a rosy blush cannot be affirmed. Therefore, the skin tone in terms of blush cannot be conclusively preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the subject facing directly forward with an upright, symmetrical posture, as in the original?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the rest of the body in Image B, the subject is portrayed in a symmetrical posture, facing directly forward. This maintains the orientation typically associated with formal portraits.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the proportions of the figure (head-to-body ratio, arm length, torso width) preserved without exaggeration or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the figure appear natural and in line with typical classical representations. The head-to-body ratio and limb proportions are maintained without apparent exaggeration, given the historical context of the clothing and posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
