      "question": "Is the orange and black tiger stripe pattern present on the hippo’s body, head, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo is depicted with an orange and black tiger stripe pattern covering its body, head, and limbs.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the visible knitted texture with distinct stitches present on the hippo’s body and the beach ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the hippo and the beach ball exhibit a knitted texture. This texture is characterized by distinct stitches that are visible on both objects. The visual cues show the stitches forming the contours and patterns on these items, indicating a textile-like surface akin to knitwear.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the face, belly, and limbs of the hippo rendered in light gray color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hippo with light gray coloring on its face, belly, and limbs. This color choice contrasts with the orange and black stripes and helps emphasize different sections of the hippo, similar to color-blocking in apparel design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach ball features red, yellow, and white stripes. However, these stripes are arranged in a radiating pattern rather than horizontal stripes. This suggests a deliberate design choice for visual appeal, and contradicts the specification of horizontal stripes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo is depicted in a playful posture, leaning slightly forward toward the beach ball with its front limbs close to or touching the object. This stance conveys a sense of interaction, commonly seen in play scenarios.",
