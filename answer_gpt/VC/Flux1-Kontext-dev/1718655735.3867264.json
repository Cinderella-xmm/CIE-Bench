        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays butterfly wings with similar veined structure and mottled brown-orange colors to typical butterfly wings.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fairy in a side profile pose; while her head is slightly turned, her gaze does not appear to be directly forward towards the viewer due to the viewing angle and positioning of the face relative to the camera.",
