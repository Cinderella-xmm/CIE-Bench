        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is predominantly grey, matching the typical coloration of an elephant's body. However, the ear color does not show any distinct brownish tones; instead, it is the same grey as the body, suggesting that the ear tone has been generalized rather than specifically represented.",
