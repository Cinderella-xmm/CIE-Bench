    "Question": "Q1: Is the cat depicted with fluffy white fur that maintains its distinct texture and coverage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is illustrated with white fur, but the style is simplified due to the nature of illustrations. It has the appearance of white fur, but lacks the distinct texture and fluffiness seen in photographs. Compared to Image A, which shows a realistic depiction with clear textures, the illustration in Image B smooths these details out. Therefore, while the fur is white, it does not preserve the distinct fluffy texture.",
