    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color without any gradient, pattern, or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a single shade of beige without any noticeable gradient, pattern, or texture. The consistent color can be identified by the absence of any visual transitions or patterns across the surface. Thus, the perception is that the background is a uniform color.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the background have no visible texture, grain, or surface variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the background shows no evidence of any texture, grain, or variation; it looks smooth and consistent. This conclusion is drawn from the absence of any visual elements that would suggest a texture or surface variation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there no shadows, reflections, or light variations on the background surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there seem to be no shadows, reflections, or variations in light on the background. The uniformity suggests even lighting, as there are no darker or lighter areas that would indicate shadows or reflections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the image framed with straight edges and no border or crop distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to be well-framed. The edges of the image show no signs of distortion or unusual cropping; everything is neatly contained within the frame. The smooth transition of the background from edge to edge supports this assessment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the background evenly distributed with no hotspots or directional shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B seems to be evenly distributed, as there are no noticeable hotspots or areas with directional shadows on the background. The consistent beige tone across the entire surface suggests uniform lighting.",
