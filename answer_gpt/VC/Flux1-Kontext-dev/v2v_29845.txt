    "Question": "Q1: Are the long, upward-curving horns of the cow present and retaining their original shape and position on the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hybrid figure has long, upward-curving horns on the head, resembling those typically found on a Highland cow. The visual cue is consistent with what is commonly known about the horn structure of these animals. By comparing with Image A, it is evident that the horn shapes and positions are maintained as they rest on both sides of the head. Thus, they are present and retain their original shape and position.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the reddish-brown shaggy fur covering the body of the hybrid figure, particularly on the head and shoulders, present and consistent with the original cow’s appearance?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a hybrid figure with reddish-brown shaggy fur prominently visible on the head and shoulders. This is typical of a Highland cow’s appearance. When comparing with Image A, the fur coloration and texture remain consistent with the original cow, confirming their presence and resemblance.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the white lab coat visible on the upper body of the hybrid figure, including the lapels, pockets, and full length down to the waist?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hybrid figure is not wearing a white lab coat on its upper body. Instead, it is wearing a button-up shirt or outfit that resembles a lab coat but has distinct textile features indicating it is more tailored clothing than the original lab coat. Therefore, the white lab coat is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the dark-colored tie visible beneath the collar of the lab coat on the hybrid figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hybrid figure does not show a dark-colored tie beneath any collar. Instead, there is no presence of a neck accessory akin to a tie as seen in the original Image A. Hence, there is no tie visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the brown trousers and black dress shoes present on the lower half of the hybrid figure, with the right leg slightly raised in a walking motion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower half of the hybrid figure is not dressed in brown trousers and black dress shoes like the original man in Image A. Instead, the figure seems to have legs that resemble more of an animal or hybrid form without those clothing elements. Therefore, the trousers and shoes are not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the hybrid figure exhibit a forward walking posture with the right leg lifted off the ground, mimicking the original man’s stride?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hybrid figure is in a stance that appears to be more stationary, not fully mimicking a walking posture or stride with the right leg clearly lifted off the ground. Compared to the original figure in Image A, the stride is not mirrored effectively. Hence, the walking posture with the leg raised is not exhibited by the hybrid figure.",
    "answer": "No"
