      "question": "Is the carrot still bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot appears bright orange in color, as visually depicted by the vibrant hue covering the body of the carrot. The shade is a strong and vivid orange, commonly associated with fresh carrots. This assessment is based on the visual cues of the color's saturation and intensity, which indicate brightness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carrot maintain its conical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot retains its conical shape, characterized by a pointed end at the bottom and a broader top where the leaves are attached. This conical form is typical for most carrots, allowing them to be rooted effectively in soil. The shape can be determined by observing the gradient between the thin bottom and the wider top of the carrot.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the green leaves still present at the top of the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrot with green leaves emerging from its top. These leaves are visibly attached to the carrot, which is a typical characteristic of a growing carrot plant, indicating that they have not been removed or edited out.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tapered top end of the carrot with visible roots still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot possesses a tapered top end with visible small roots protruding or wrapping around it. This is a typical feature observed in carrots, where root hairs often emerge from the top surface, contributing to anchoring in the soil.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carrot still positioned upright in the substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the carrot standing vertically in the substrate, as evidenced by its conical alignment from top to bottom without inclination. The upright position is discerned through the directionality in which the carrot emerges from the soil, maintaining a straight axis.",
