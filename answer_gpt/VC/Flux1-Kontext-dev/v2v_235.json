      "question": "Is the dancer depicted with short dark hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is shown with short hair that appears to be dark. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues, where the hair color contrasts with the surroundings, and the length is consistent with styles typically referred to as 'short'. The dancer’s hair does not extend past the neck or shoulders, indicating a short hairstyle.",

      "question": "Is the dancer wearing a black sleeveless leotard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show the dancer dressed in clothing that closely fits the body, consistent with what is typically referred to as a leotard. The leotard is black in color and does not appear to have sleeves, which fits the description of a black sleeveless leotard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the dancer’s pose shows the right leg raised and extended upward, while the left leg is planted firmly on the ground, supporting the weight of the body. This typical ballet position is visually evident, as the raised leg points towards the ceiling while the other leg maintains contact with the floor.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s head is turned slightly to the left, as indicated by the direction in which the neck is angled and the visible side of the face. This posture is consistent with the head turned to the left with a forward orientation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dancer’s left hand extended in front of their body, directed towards the viewer. The fingers are spread apart, which matches the description of the hand being extended forward with splayed fingers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the dancer’s body form a diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall posture of the dancer creates a visual diagonal line. The body’s alignment—from the grounded left leg to the upward-extended right leg—forms a diagonal path across the frame, reaching from the lower left to the upper right corner. This diagonal composition is reinforced by the pose and placement within the image space.",
