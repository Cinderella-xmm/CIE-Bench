      "question": "Does the image retain the cylindrical, elongated shape of the baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two objects resembling baseball bats have a cylindrical and elongated shape that is consistent with baseball bats. Through the use of shading and outlines, the artist has effectively depicted them in a way that maintains their cylindrical form, which is expected of baseball bats.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black taped handles of the bats still distinctly visible against the wooden shafts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portion of the bats corresponding to the handles is colored in a darker shade, presumably black, which stands in contrast to the lighter color of the wooden shafts. This distinction in color clearly marks the area of the black taped handles as separate from the wooden shafts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the two baseball bats remain parallel to each other in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two bats are positioned in a manner that suggests they remain parallel to each other. They run in the same direction and maintain the same spacing throughout their length, indicating parallel alignment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats still placed on a grassy surface, indicating an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts two bats laying on a surface that features grass-like textures and coloring. The artist's depiction of grass blades supports the conclusion that the bats are resting on a grassy surface, suggesting it is an outdoor setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bats maintain their slight angle toward the viewer, preserving perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perspective is illustrated such that the bats appear to be slightly angled towards the viewer, as the distal ends of the bats are larger compared to the proximal ends. This use of perspective helps in giving a three-dimensional appearance, suggesting the bats are angled relative to a viewerâ€™s vantage point, similar to Image A.",
