      "question": "Is the woman depicted in a three-quarter pose, leaning on the column with her head turned toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is leaning on a white column with her left arm, but her head is not turned towards the viewer since her face is blurred. A three-quarter pose typically involves the upper body being turned slightly to the side while the face looks towards the viewer, which we cannot confirm due to the blur.",
