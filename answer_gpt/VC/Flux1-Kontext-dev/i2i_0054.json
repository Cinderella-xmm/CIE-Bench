      "question": "Is the detailed texture of the elephant's skin, showing wrinkles and creases, preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skin texture of the elephant is apparent with visible wrinkles and creases. This indicates the rendering has been done with attention to preserving realistic skin details, likely showing a realistic depiction of an elephant. The editing seems to focus on maintaining the natural characteristics of the elephant's skin that are typically present in real-life observations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk, retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the elephant is noteworthy as it resembles an elephant in motion or a young elephant exploring its surroundings. The front leg of the elephant is slightly raised and the trunk is curved downwards, suggesting an attention to detail in replicating the original stance seen in typical elephant behaviors. This posture is maintained in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk, consistent with its young age, maintained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears are relatively smaller compared to its head, and the trunk also presents a proportional length typical of a young elephant. When analyzing the proportions, the visual cues in Image B suggest that the dimensions are characteristic of juvenile elephants, supporting a realistic and age-congruent depiction.",

      "question": "Is the elephant positioned on the rock edge, with its legs and trunk maintaining their relative placement to the rock surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant standing on a flat surface instead of a rock edge. The rock seen in Image A is not present, and the positioning of the legs and trunk is different as they are placed directly on the flat ground, changing the spatial relationship with the supposed rock edge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant face towards the right side of the image, preserving its profile orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the elephant facing towards the right side, confirming that the profile orientation is preserved. The visible features like the eye and ear position as well as the direction of the trunk indicate the elephant is indeed oriented to the right, thus maintaining the profile from Image A.",
