    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bird's eye clearly visible with a dark blue iris, black pupil, and a thin white orbital ring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eye is large and prominently drawn, consistent with a cartoonish or animated style. It features a black pupil, a blue iris, and a white highlight at the top of the eye, rather than a thin white orbital ring. The depiction differs from a natural bird's eye as seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bird have a short, conical beak that is pale pinkish-gray with a dark tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bird's beak is noticeably stylized to appear cartoonish and is orange in color, diverging from the naturalistic depiction in Image A, which has a pale pinkish-gray conical beak with a dark tip.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bird’s feathers visibly fluffy and layered, with warm earthy tones including tan, brown, and reddish crown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feathers are stylized rather than realistic, maintaining an earthy palette with tan and brown primarily, but the reddish crown is less prominent than in Image A. The cartoonish rendering prioritizes basic shapes over realistic texturing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bird’s tail feathers extend downward in a long, narrow, layered shape with natural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's tail feathers are depicted in a cartoonish fashion, which means they are simplified and do not reflect the long, narrow, or layered representation seen in Image A. The shading is less natural due to a more animated style.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bird’s feet visible with claws gripping the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is shown standing beside an open map rather than on a branch; thus, its feet holding onto a branch as seen in Image A is not demonstrated. The image highlights a different scenario where the feet are visible but adapted to its cartoonish context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bird positioned upright on the branch, facing slightly to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the bird in an upright position akin to Image A, but with a different context of holding an open map. The cartoon style suggests an anthropomorphized stance, and it still faces slightly to the left.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there green moss visible on the right side of the branch beneath the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is different as the bird is not on a branch but standing next to a map or book, set against a different background, thus lacking any branch or moss context present in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
