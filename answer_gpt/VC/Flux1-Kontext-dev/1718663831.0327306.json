      "question": "Is the dog's fur primarily white with distinct sandy-colored spots on the ears and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's body appears primarily white, which is consistent with certain fluffy breeds. Without considering the blurred face, the ears visible at the upper sides appear to have a distinct color differing from pure white, which could indicate sandy-colored spots. These visual cues and knowledge of common dog coat patterns help draw this conclusion.",

      "question": "Does the dog have a rounded head with pointed ears and a short muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visible features in Image B, the dog shows a body shape suggesting a rounded head and pointed ears are characteristic of certain small dog breeds. While the muzzle itself can't be directly observed due to the blurred area, general breed characteristics and visual interpretations suggest that a short muzzle is likely.",

      "question": "Are the dog wearing black rectangular sunglasses with dark lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area around the eyes isn't fully visible due to blurring, but there are no visual cues or structures suggesting the presence of sunglasses. Typical indicators of sunglasses, such as reflections or frames, are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's posture in Image B clearly illustrates an upright seated position, with the legs and body directly facing forward. This position is identifiable by the symmetrical placement of the legs and the orientation of the torso pointing forward.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's depiction of the dog shows features that indicate a compact body structure, such as a broad chest and dense fur. The short legs are discernible by the relative position and length visible beneath the torso. The volume of fur surrounding the chest and back hints at a fluffy tail, which is characteristic of certain small dog breeds.",
