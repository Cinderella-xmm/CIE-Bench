      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model holds a black bag with a circular gold-tone MK logo charm, which is clearly visible as it hangs from the strap of the bag. The logo charm does not appear on her attire directly but as part of the accessory she holds. The visibility of this charm aligns with its presence and location.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'MICHAEL KORS' brand name appears in gold uppercase letters on the black bag held by the model. This part of the image makes the brand name visible; however, it is not present on the model's attire itself but on the accessory she carries.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model's dress appears smooth and lacks the pebbled texture that characterizes the bag seen in Image A. The dress is a simple, solid black material, distinctly different from the textured surface of the bag.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the model holding a bag that has various gold-tone hardware elements, such as buckles and the MK charm. However, these elements are not part of her clothing, but part of the accessory she holds. The clothing itself does not show these hardware elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible zippered pocket with a gold-tone pull on the model’s dress or outfit. The zippered pocket is part of the bag she holds, not a feature of her attire.",
