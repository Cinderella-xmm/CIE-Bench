        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky contains the characteristic swirling vortex pattern, which is iconic of the original painting 'The Starry Night.' These swirls maintain the same texture and positioning. This observation is based on the distinct, continuous spiral-like motions across the sky, which are retained from the painting's style. Therefore, the edited image does retain the swirling vortex texture in the sky.",

      "question": "Is the prominent cypress tree on the left side of the image still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tall, prominent dark shape on the left side, akin to a cypress tree, which is consistent with the original painting 'The Starry Night.' This cypress is a distinctive element due to its towering presence and vertical alignment, making it recognizable. By comparing with Image A, we confirm that the cypress tree is present in both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the middle ground features a cluster of buildings with a distinct tall, pointed shape resembling a church steeple, similar to Van Gogh's depiction of a village. By analyzing Image A, the same central positioning of the village and church steeple can be observed, confirming the church steeple is retained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background landscape with undulating lines and forms that suggest the presence of rolling hills under the starry sky. This fits with the elements of the original image, where the hills create a natural horizon line. Comparison with Image A confirms the continuation of these hills into the edited image, as seen by their distinctive shapes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors are blues and yellows, consistent with 'The Starry Night.' The texture, observable by the thick, defined brushstrokes, creates a similar effect to Van Gogh's iconic style. Comparison with Image A shows both color and texture are faithfully retained in the edited image.",
