      "question": "Are the curved rockers at the base of the chair present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curved rockers at the base of the chair are clearly visible. This is a typical feature of a rocking chair, allowing it to rock back and forth. The rockers are depicted with a smooth and defined curve. This conclusion is drawn from my understanding of how rocking chairs are designed, with a base that enables movement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the back of the chair composed of multiple vertical spindles arranged between the top and bottom rails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the back of the chair composed of several vertical spindles set between a top horizontal rail and a bottom rail. These spindles extend vertically, a common structural element for offering support and design detail in traditional wooden chairs. This observation aligns with world knowledge of classic rocking chair designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests curved and connected to the front legs with turned supports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair's armrests are depicted as curved with a smooth arc that ends in a connection to the front legs using turned supports. Turned supports typically feature rounded shapes due to lathe processing. This understanding is based on characteristics commonly found in traditional chair designs, where the armrests offer comfort and stability.",

      "question": "Are there spherical finials at the top of the two upright back posts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small spheres are visibly present at the top of the two upright back posts. These spherical finials are decorative elements frequently found in traditional wooden chair designs, adding a refined touch to the chair's structure.",

      "question": "Does the chair maintain its original proportions, with a tall back, curved seat, and balanced leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a chair that holds its proportions: it has a tall back for support, a curved seat for comfort, and legs that are symmetrically aligned with the base rockers. These elements collectively ensure a stable and aesthetically appealing design. This understanding stems from common chair mechanics and designs that prioritize both form and function.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rockers are directly attached to the front legs, creating a cohesive and continuous curved base. This design facilitates the rocking motion characteristic of rocking chairs, adhering to typical construction principles of such furniture.",
