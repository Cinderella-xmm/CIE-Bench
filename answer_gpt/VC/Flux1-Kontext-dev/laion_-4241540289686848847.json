      "question": "Does the character retain the golden-yellow eye color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s face is blurred, making it impossible to determine the eye color based on the visual information provided. Without the ability to see the eyes, we cannot confirm their color. The question asks specifically about eye color, which is obscured.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character’s facial structure (jawline, cheekbones, nose shape) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face is blurred in Image B, making it impossible to visually evaluate the facial structure such as jawline, cheekbones, and nose shape. Since these features are not discernible due to the blurring, we cannot confirm their preservation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blurring of the face obscures any details about the skin tone and texture. Without visual information about these aspects due to the blur, we cannot confirm whether they are preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the character with distinct elements like the elaborate robe and staff, similar to a character in a fantasy setting, likely suggesting a preservation of elements like attire and accessories relevant to body proportions. Despite the blurred face, the visible elements like hands holding an object and positioning suggest consistency in stance.",

      "question": "Is the camera angle and lighting direction preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown from a frontal angle with the lighting source illuminating from a certain direction, casting shadows and highlights on the character and surrounding objects. The details in the attire and background give the impression of similar lighting conditions, aligning with general principles of camera angles and lighting techniques in similar visual artworks.",

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is placed in front of a detailed backdrop featuring laboratory or study-like elements, suggesting an indoor setting. Visual cues in the alignment of the character relative to these elements indicate a specific positioning that provides depth and context, consistent with typical relative arrangements in composed art scenes.",
