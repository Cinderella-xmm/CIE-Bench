      "question": "Is the text \"REVERE BEACH\" visible on the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary subject is a blurred area that is typically not related to the clock described in the choices. However, analyzing the environment and possible resemblance to typical prop objects used in such images, there is no textual evidence present related to a clock or similar objects indicating 'REVERE BEACH'.",

      "question": "Does the clock face display Roman numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no specific visual indication in Image B suggestive of a clock or Roman numerals. The main subject appears to be a living room setup without visible clock details.",

      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a tall, ornate metal post?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, which seems more like an indoor setting, does not carry characteristics reflective of a tall, ornate metal post typically found outdoors. Thus, considering the focal points and environment in Image B, this feature does not exist.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B does not visibly align with outdoor elements like an ocean or a clear sky. It reflects an indoor environment contrasting the features described, suggesting a domestic living room scene instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's context does not illustrate any clock faces or positioning details that would orient a clock face toward the viewer. Hence based on the description characteristics visible in Image B, this feature cannot be confirmed.",
