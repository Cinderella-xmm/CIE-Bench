      "question": "Is the horse depicted with a dark mane running along its neck and a long, dark tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the horse has a mane that is visibly darker than the rest of its body, running along the neck, and the tail is also dark and long, extending downwards. The contrast between the brown coat and the dark mane and tail is clear, confirming this description.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in the edited image (Image B) shows two curved tusks protruding from its mouth. However, they are not white; they are the same color as the elephant's body, a brownish-gray. The absence of a distinct color for the tusks indicates that they are not white.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), a flat surface is seen between the horse and the elephant, supporting the horse and seemingly resting on the elephant’s back. The structure has the appearance of wood, suggesting it could be interpreted as a wooden platform.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the horse and the elephant in the edited image (Image B) are shown in profile view, with their heads and bodies oriented toward the left side. This is evidenced by the side view of their heads and the alignment of their bodies.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in the edited image (Image B) has a trunk that extends downward and then curls upward at the tip, suggesting segmentation typical of an elephant’s trunk. This detail is visually consistent with how elephant trunks are often depicted.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) has a background that is out of focus with ambient lighting rather than a uniform beige color. It does not have a paper-like texture but rather appears smooth and gradient with no additional objects or scenery.",
