      "question": "Is the bag still rectangular in shape with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag appears to have a rectangular shape with clearly defined edges. The corners of the bag are still rounded, which is typical for bags to maintain a softer aesthetic while being practical in design. Analyzing the structure visually shows continuity in the standard rectangular form. Therefore, based on the visual cues in Image B, the bag maintains its rectangular shape with rounded corners.",

      "question": "Does the bag retain a flap-over front section with a horizontal crease?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag's front section features intricate metal panels that cover the entire front, unlike a traditional flap that folds over a crease. The design looks continuous without a visible folding mechanism indicating a flap. With this design shift, thereâ€™s no evidence of a flap-over feature with a horizontal crease visible in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a zipper running across the top edge of the bag with a visible gold-tone pull tab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A zipper is visible running along the top edge of the bag in Image B, and the pull tab is gold-tone, matching the typical accessory color for premium bags. This feature remains unaltered in its function and appearance, as evidenced by the visible pull tab.",

      "question": "Are there two vertical stitched panels visible beneath the flap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front area where vertical stitched panels could have been is entirely covered with decorative metalwork. This ornamentation does not show any stitching, especially two vertical panels; hence, there are no stitched panels visible beneath a flap.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The details in Image B reveal an adjustable shoulder strap that features buckles at both ends, maintaining the bag's practical function. The buckles appear to have a brass finish, which is consistent with the design aesthetic for premium accessories.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is shown positioned horizontally and is upright, with its center aligned approximately with the middle of the frame. This positioning allows for a clear view of the front design, indicating that the bag is centrally placed and stable in its orientation.",
