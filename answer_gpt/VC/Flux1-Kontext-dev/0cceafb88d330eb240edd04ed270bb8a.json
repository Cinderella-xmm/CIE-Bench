      "question": "Is the pomegranate present and clearly identifiable as a red, round fruit with visible internal seeds, held in the hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a red, round object held in the hands, which resembles a pomegranate. Unlike the pomegranate in Image A, which is cut open to display internal seeds, the object in Image B is intact and does not show seeds. World knowledge about pomegranates and visual cues confirm the identity of the fruit as a pomegranate based on color and shape, but it does not depict visible internal seeds.",

      "question": "Does the headscarf retain its golden-yellow base color with diagonal stripes in purple, blue, and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headscarf has a base color of golden-yellow, similar to Image A. However, the stripes in Image B are vibrant and clear, consisting of blue and red but slightly differing in number and arrangement from Image A. While purple stripes are more evident in Image A, they appear bluish in Image B. The overall visual impression of a golden-yellow base with red and blue stripes is more pronounced here.",

      "question": "Is the left ear adorned with a silver earring featuring a red gemstone and dangling components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible detail or embellishment around the ear area as the design lacks human features or accessories in the ear region. Image A shows a detailed silver earring with a red gemstone and dangling elements, which are not present in Image B, indicating an absence of such adornment.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brown outer vest lacks intricate embroidered detailing that is visible in Image A. The brown garment in Image B is simpler, without prominent embroidery or decoration along the collar and shoulder seams, reflecting a more minimalist design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts both hands around the pomegranate, similar to Image A, and they show a characteristic grip on the fruit. The positioning of the hands aligns with the concept of holding and supporting the fruit securely.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
