    "Question": "Q1: Is the number '1423' clearly visible on the front of the train?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front part of the train is stylized using bold outlines, and the number '1423' from Image A is intentionally left out. Pop art illustrations often focus on color and shape rather than textual details. This technique is used to emphasize colors and general shapes rather than specifics like numbers. Thus, based on Image B, the number '1423' is not clearly visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the train have two circular headlights below a central white circular light on its front?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the front of the train, which is stylized with the use of basic geometric shapes, similar to Image A. The design includes two circular headlights below a centrally positioned circular light, consistent with both the original and stylized formats. Thus, these features are depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple vertical rows of white-framed windows on the side of the barn?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the stylized representation of the barn includes several rows of rectangle shapes that imply windows. Their visual style suggests white frames by contrast. Image B retains the structural design elements from Image A, translating them into the pop art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two large wooden doors centered on the lower part of the barnâ€™s front facade?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the barn front facade is presented without distinguishing individual elements easily. The style abstracts details like doors into geometric patterns. A comparison with Image A shows that while the barn in Image A has distinct wooden doors, Image B uses color spots and contrasts without depicting specific door structures next to a large entrance. Therefore, such doors are not visually present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the railway tracks extend forward from under the train and curve gently to the right into the distance?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows tracks extending straight and disappearing into the pop art-styled foreground. Railway tracks are linear with no obvious curve, which reflects the transformation of details to match an artistic theme. While Image A exhibits a subtle curve to the right, Image B maintains a straight path, valuing simplified geometry over realism.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the yellow triangular warning sign with a blue border and the '50' speed limit sign visible near the track on the left side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the border sign retains its place but is restyled with exaggerated colors and patterns typical of pop art. Despite simplification and abstraction in the art form, no '50' speed limit sign appears at the suggested location. Comparison with Image A confirms the absence of numerical detail in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the train positioned directly on the railway tracks?",
    "explanation": "The edited Image B depicts the train aligned directly onto the railway tracks, similar to its realistic portrayal in Image A. The stylized image retains the positioning accurately by using bold, straight lines to represent the tracks under the train. Thus, alignment in both is consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
