      "question": "Are there four clock faces, one on each visible side of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the tower is visible with two clock faces clearly shown, suggesting there might be four in total, one on each side of the tower. However, since Image B only shows two clock faces, we can only confirm that there are two visible clock faces. Without evidence of faces on the other sides, we cannot conclusively say there are four just on the visible evidence from Image B alone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clock faces contain black Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces on the tower clearly show black Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern. The Roman numerals and circular design are typical for clock faces, suggesting the use of traditional representation of time.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a steeply pitched pyramidal roof topped with a finial at the very top of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the tower in Image B does show a steeply pitched pyramidal roof with a pointed feature at the top, known as a finial. This is a common design element for such structures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four arched openings at the base of the tower, one on each side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the towerâ€™s base displays arches visibly from the angle presented. We see two arched openings from this vantage point, so it is reasonable to conclude that there could be four arches assuming symmetry, but only two are visible here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tower located at the center of a circular road with vehicles traveling around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tower situated in the middle of a circular pattern that resembles a roundabout, with vehicles seen traveling around it. This indicates the tower is likely placed at the center of a circular road.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple cars visible on the road surrounding the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several cars illustrated traveling along the circular road surrounding the tower, indicating the presence of multiple vehicles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there trees with bare or sparse foliage visible along the road behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts trees with lush green foliage along the road in the background, suggesting a spring or summer setting rather than bare or sparse branches typical of late autumn or winter.",
