      "question": "Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases two structures resembling the Eiffel Tower, each with a detailed metallic lattice framework. This lattice design is consistent with the iconic appearance and engineering of the actual Eiffel Tower, which is known for its wrought-iron construction. The depiction in Image B suggests an architectural style similar to that of the real Eiffel Tower because of these intricate lattice details.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bases of both towers appear more cylindrical or rectangular rather than triangular, with the structure emerges from the ground in a manner typical of the Eiffel Towerâ€™s actual base which features four separate legs that support the tower. This layout does not resemble a triangular base, nor does it explicitly show four distinct pillars.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath each tower, an arch-like opening is visible, allowing a pathway to pass through. This feature mirrors the design of the genuine Eiffel Tower where there is an open area and walkways underneath the base. The use of an archway design below the towers in Image B suggests a pathway can pass beneath each structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, there are clearly two distinct Eiffel Tower structures displayed, identical in design and scale, standing side by side. This observation is based on their alignment and clear separation within the visual frame.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts two structures, each topped with a distinct pointed spire. This spire design is consistent with the characteristic feature of the Eiffel Tower, which culminates in a pointed pinnacle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a close inspection reveals that each tower seems to have multiple levels, however, only two platform sections seem distinctly clear along the towers' heights. This is fewer than the three horizontal platform levels characteristic of the actual Eiffel Tower.",
