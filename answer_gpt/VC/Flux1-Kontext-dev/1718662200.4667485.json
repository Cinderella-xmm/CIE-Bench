      "question": "Is the pig’s snout clearly visible with two distinct nostrils and a rounded, pink shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is depicted in a cartoon style which emphasizes simplified and bold features. The snout is clearly drawn with two distinct nostrils, characterized by a rounded shape and colored pink, making it visibly prominent. This contrasts with Image A where more realistic shading and detailing are applied.",

      "question": "Are the pig’s ears large, upright, and pink with visible inner ear details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's ears are drawn large and upright, typical for a cartoon style, with a pink coloration that provides a contrast to the background. The inner ear details are visible through color contrast, supporting an eye-catching design. In Image A, the realistic texturing also makes these features clear but with more natural shading.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pig wearing round red sunglasses, fitting tightly against the pig's face. The lenses and frame are distinctly colored red, a stylistic choice that resonates with the playful cartoon theme. In Image A, similar sunglasses appear, but with realistic lens reflections and detailed frame textures.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on a cartoon representation and doesn't feature a realistic DJ setup. Instead, the pig is holding a microphone, reflecting a music theme but not with a turntable setup. This differs from Image A where a detailed turntable setup is prominent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is depicted in a joyful cartoon personification without headphones. Instead, props like sunglasses and a microphone are emphasized. This contrasts with Image A where the pig is wearing headphones in a realistic DJ setup.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pig vividly wearing a red shirt, complete with a collar and sleeves as part of its cartoon style, focusing on simple but clear attire representation. This is consistent with Image A where the pig wears a more realistic depiction of a red shirt.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig’s front limbs are not positioned on a turntable but are part of expressive poses for the character. This is different from Image A where the pig is interacting with a realistic turntable setup, using its hooves directly on the equipment.",
