      "question": "Is the key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and central knob present on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf is smaller in scale and has a pyramid-like top. Upon examining the leftmost book on the bottom shelf, it is visible that none of the books possess the key-shaped symbol with swirling elements. This type of detailed design is not apparent in the smaller forms of the books visible in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spiral motif clearly visible on the central book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central book on the bottom shelf doesnâ€™t display a clear spiral motif. The detailing on any singular book has been minimized due to the scale and uniform coloring of the books, making it difficult to identify specific motifs clearly.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flowing vine-like pattern present on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rightmost book on the bottom shelf of Image B does not display the intricate vine-like pattern. The visible books have muted covers without notable patterns or designs present in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the interlacing Celtic knotwork patterns present on the top panel and vertical side frames of the bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bookshelf constructed from stack-like elements without visible interlacing patterns such as Celtic knotwork on its top panel or vertical frames. The design is simplified, and the intricate knotwork observed generally in artistic and traditional designs is absent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three large books with detailed carvings positioned side by side on the bottom shelf, from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows smaller books without detailed carvings positioned side by side on the bottom shelf. The scale and the simplistic design of the bookshelf minimize the chance for detailed carvings, unlike potentially larger and intricately carved items conventionally identified in descriptions of carved books.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least four books with visible carved spines distributed across the middle and upper shelves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the bookshelf holds books on multiple shelves, the books do not present visible carved spines. The simplified representation doesn't allow for detailed carving visibility, and thus, does not fulfill the requirement of having four carved spines distributed across shelves.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the books and structural elements rendered in earthy tones such as brown, tan, and muted red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf and books are rendered in earthy tones. The shelf and books integrate colors such as muted beige, tan, and some muted brown shades contributing to a natural palette reflective of earthy tones.",
