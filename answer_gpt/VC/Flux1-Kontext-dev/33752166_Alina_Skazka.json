      "question": "Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the robot resembles a building, but the structure is far from the original V-shaped dual-wing style seen in Image A. Image B showcases a squared, uniform box shape that clearly deviates from the original silhouette provided by the angled, dual-wing architecture of Image A. This conclusion is reached by comparing the isolated box shape of the edited version to the dynamic, asymmetrical V-shaped form in the original image.",

      "question": "Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the structure atop the robot body does feature a modular pattern resembling sequential floors. The layering of architectural modules suggests a consistent stacking from bottom to top, characteristic of a building or tower. This pattern, while simplified, creates a recognizable floor-like repetition similar to the architecture seen in Image A since in the context of this image, repetitive stacking appears uniformly consistent.",

      "question": "Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows around the robot's building-like head appear horizontally aligned and consistent across each floor section of the structure, similar to conventional architectural window alignment. These alignments reflect a horizontal consistency typically expected in buildings, providing the impression of organized levels. Image A presents a more chaotic arrangement, but Image B maintains a structured horizontal alignment for visual coherence.",

      "question": "Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the dynamic structure with a purely geometric, rectangular form. The 'wings' concept from Image A is lost in favor of a symmetry achieved through a cube-like head structure. Here, the aligned shape illustrates straightforward symmetry and vertical orientation, removing any complexities of wing alignment. This is contrasted with the potentially asymmetrical two-wing layout in Image A, suggesting Image B does not maintain its detailed wing symmetry.",

      "question": "Are the yellow awnings present on the balconies in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, the architectural facade of the robot's head displays uniform windowed sections all with the same coloration and appearance, but notably lacks distinctive features like awnings or balconies that could serve as sunshades or aesthetic accessories. Image A shows yellow awnings in specific positions which do not transfer to Image B. World understanding shows these architectural features are usually consistent, but absent here.",

      "question": "Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a facade with windowed panels that lack any depth separation typical of a balcony overhang. The boxes fitting together indicate flush arrangements without protruding elements. Image A, however, clearly outlines separation visible as projecting balcony areas contrast with inward window sections, marking architectural divisions lost in the edited version.",
