      "question": "Is the grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface of the cake present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the depiction involves cartoon-style graphics instead of a realistic photo of the cake. The image uses characters instead of an actual cake, hence there is no grid of yellow rounded domes covering the surface in this image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small red dots on top of each yellow dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, since it is a cartoon image with a character, it does not depict any yellow domes with small red dots on top. The cartoon theme does not include these specific details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cross-section showing a golden sponge base, white cream layer, and deep red jam layer visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a realistic cross-section of a cake as it features a cartoon character associated with cake. It does not show any layers like a golden sponge base, white cream layer, or deep red jam layer.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon character in Image B has a strawberry hat and other floating strawberries, but there are no strawberries positioned on a cake top as in a realistic cake representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is a cartoon image focusing on a character with no realistic depiction of a cake base, there are no chopped nuts visible in this image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Does the cake maintain a square shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than depicting a square-shaped cake, it shows a character-based illustration that does not maintain a cakeâ€™s geometric shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B eliminates all realistic cake and plate features from Image A, including the silver-toned plate with an embossed floral pattern, in favor of cartoon representations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the deep red jam layer clearly visible between the white cream and golden sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is a cartoon representation without any cake cross-section detail, thus the layers including the deep red jam layer are not visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no realistic depiction such as layers of cream between sponge and jam is present because it is a cartoon illustration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, focusing on cartoon-style graphics, lacks a realistic cake cross-section and therefore does not show any golden sponge base layer.",
