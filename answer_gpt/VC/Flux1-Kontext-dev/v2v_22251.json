        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region where the subject's face appears has been blurred, thus obscuring any specific details about facial features. Without visible information, it is not possible to assess if the facial features are unchanged.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject exhibits long black hair which is clearly visible. The hair frames the subject's face and falls over the shoulders, suggesting it remains unchanged.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green earrings are clearly visible in the subject's ears, indicating that they are still present. The earrings appear unchanged compared to typical jewelry, suggesting consistency in accessory choice.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject's orientation in Image B suggests a forward-facing pose, and due to the blurred facial region, a specific expression cannot be discerned. However, the overall body posture aligns with a neutral stance, indicating the subject likely maintains a similar position as expected.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a graphic design is visible on the subject's clothing, positioned centrally on what appears to be a t-shirt. The visibility of this graphic suggests that the design remains present on the garment.",
