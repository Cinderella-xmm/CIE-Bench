      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there two vertically stacked pancake layers, with the bottom one slightly larger than the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues in Image B, the pancake depiction involves a character designed like stacked pancakes. It resembles two stacked pancake layers, as the character has a layered appearance suggesting this. This interpretation uses world knowledge of cartoon design, which often uses exaggerated features. However, without distinct differentiation between top and bottom layers in size, it's more of an imaginative representation than exact realism. Comparing with Image A involves identifying two pancake layers on the plate. While both involve stacking, the cartoon exaggerates features and does not specify the comparative size clearly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the pancakes retain a dominant golden-yellow color throughout their visible surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cartoon character modeled after a pancake remains a strong golden-yellow hue, consistent with the vibrant design often used in illustrations to indicate pancakes. In world knowledge, cartoons amplify colors for engagement. Comparing with Image A, we recognize similar color consistency across its realistic pancake surfaces, affirming its golden-yellow appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a solid, rectangular pat of pale yellow butter placed on the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, atop the pancake-like cartoon character, there's an illustration resembling a pat of butter, maintaining a depiction congruent with the bold cartoon style, which mimics the butter placement commonly seen on pancakes. This resembles the butter slice found on Image A, where a realistic pat sits atop the pancake stack.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible stream of amber-colored syrup flowing from a pitcher onto the pancakes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon scene with syrup flowing around the character, originating from a jug held by another character, which indicates syrup pouring. Cartoons emphasize this through dynamic visuals associated with pancakes. In Image A, syrup visibly flows from a pitcher, demonstrating a realistic syrup stream onto the pancakes. Both images highlight similar elements, albeit through differing artistic styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pancake stack placed on a white plate with a light blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a plate visible with pancakes and other elements, fitting the cartoon style such as simplified lines and exaggerated dimensions. The plate has no blue rim, unlike the white plate with a light blue rim identified in Image A where realistic depictions are observed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inner sides of the pancakes visibly porous and airy, showing a spongy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the cartoon stylization doesn't include specific texture indicators typical of real pancake porosity. Cartoons often abstract powder and textures. Image A shows realistic pancake textures with visible spongy interiors. The comic representation lacks focus on texture realism compared to the photographic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream originate from above the stack and flow downward onto the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates syrup presence around the pancake character, but lacks clear depiction of a syrup stream originating from above, common in realistic pancake settings. In Image A, syrup clearly flows onto the pancakes from above, a realistic aesthetic captured in the photograph.",
