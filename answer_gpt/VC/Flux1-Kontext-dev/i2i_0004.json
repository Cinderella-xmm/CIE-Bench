      "question": "Does the image retain the man’s smiling expression and distinct facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the man with a blurred face, which eliminates any discernible facial features, including expressions such as smiling. The blur completely obscures the man's face, making it impossible to identify any distinct features. Hence, without facial features visible, the image does not retain any expression.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, despite the blur obscuring the face, the man’s hairstyle is visible. It shows short, neatly styled hair similar to the original image. Although blurred in the facial area, the hairstyle matches those attributes and is accurately retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the subject wearing the same black T-shirt with the distinctive central white graphic design seen in the original image. The clothing retains its original design and color, accurately mirroring the features from the unedited version.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the subject clearly situated near or in front of a bookshelf. The visible shelves in the background containing books confirm the presence of a bookshelf, consistent with common settings where individuals can be positioned near them.",

      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background contains books on the bookshelf, prominently displaying both blue and red-colored books. This matches the color scheme seen in the original image, maintaining consistency between the two versions with visible blue and red book colors in the surroundings.",
