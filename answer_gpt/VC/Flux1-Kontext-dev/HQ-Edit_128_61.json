    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel is not centered; it is placed more towards the bottom part of the image and slightly to the right, with more visible space on the left side of the image. This can be concluded by observing the spatial distribution of elements and the noticeable empty space on the left side.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show a circular tray beneath the vessel, as indicated by the circular outline surrounding the base of the vessel. This suggests the vessel is placed on a tray.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual analysis of Image B, there is smoke or vapor visibly emanating from the top opening of the vessel, indicating some form of hot content inside. The presence of rising smoke is an indication drawn from observing the lighter, wispy trails appearing above the object.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vessel have a conical or upward-tapering shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vessel in Image B is characterized by its conical shape with a wide base and a narrow top, which indicates an upward-tapering design. This is commonly seen in vessels like tagines, and the image reflects this shape clearly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vessel placed on a flat, patterned fabric surface that covers the visible ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a flat surface covered with a brightly colored fabric, displaying geometric patterns, extending over the visible ground plane. This arrangement establishes that the vessel is indeed placed on such a surface, as indicated by the continuity of the fabric pattern around the vessel.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the vessel features a small opening from which vapor is escaping. This opening can be identified as smaller in diameter relative to the overall vessel size, fitting the description of a 'small opening'.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tray made of a material visually similar to the vessel (e.g., terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the vessel and the tray in Image B appear to have similar visual material properties, with a color and texture that suggest terracotta, a common material used for such items. The color matching and surface texture support this assessment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the fabric beneath the vessel display a structured geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric surface in Image B is decorated with a structured geometric pattern, featuring repeated shapes and colors that form a consistent design. This observation is based on identifiable motifs such as zigzags and interlocking lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
