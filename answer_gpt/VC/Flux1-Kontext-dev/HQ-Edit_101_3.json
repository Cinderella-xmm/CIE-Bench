      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the bird is illustrated in a vibrant yellow color that stands out against the pink background and the cherry blossoms. Comparing this to Image A, the original image, we see that the bird in Image A is also rendered in a vibrant yellow color. The use of striking yellow in both images creates a bright and eye-catching subject. Therefore, the bird's color in Image B is consistent with that in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's wings have distinct black stripes that provide contrast to its yellow body. This detail is significant in bird illustrations for adding a realistic touch. Looking at Image A, the original, we notice similar black stripes on the wings, which match the depiction in Image B. Therefore, the presence of black stripes in Image B is consistent with the original image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird with a clearly defined round black eye, contributing to its cute and appealing appearance.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are illustrated with five rounded petals and a pale pink hue, a common depiction for such flowers. These details add a delicate and harmonious background to the image. Image A also features cherry blossoms that share these characteristics—five petals and a pale pink color—indicating consistency in depiction between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the bird’s feet appear to have an orange-yellow coloration. This is a typical depiction in illustrations to create a natural transition from the yellow body to the feet. Looking at Image A, the bird’s feet are also shown in an orange-yellow color, matching the edited image. Thus, the color of the bird’s feet in Image B aligns with the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird’s feet are positioned in a way that realistically depicts them gripping a branch. This positioning is crucial for conveying a sense of stability and natural behavior in bird illustrations. Examining Image A, we find that the bird's feet are similarly positioned to show a gripping action on a branch. Therefore, the positioning of the bird's feet is consistent in portraying gripping in both images.",
