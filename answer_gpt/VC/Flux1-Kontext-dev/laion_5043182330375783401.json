    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mustache present and clearly defined above the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blurred face area where the mustache would typically be. However, since the face is blurred and no visual cues suggest the presence of a mustache, we cannot see any mustache or define its clarity above the upper lip.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes closed in the facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial region is blurred, hindering the ability to assess the status of the eyes. Since visual cues such as eyelids or lashes are obscured, it’s impossible to determine whether the eyes are open or closed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure’s right arm resting on the back of the chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, the figure's right arm is depicted resting across the chest with the hand positioned near the left shoulder, not on the back of the chair. The arm supports this positioning through visible visual structure of the arm and its position relative to the body.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a seated position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a figure with bent legs and a posture consistent with sitting. The presence of a chair and the figure's positioning with bent knees further affirm the seated position, a common depiction in art or imagery when a chair is present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the number “27826” visible in the bottom right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the number “27826” in the bottom right corner, differentiating it from the number present in Image A. The black border in Image B aids in drawing attention to this detail, which aligns with the typical placement for such identifiers.",
