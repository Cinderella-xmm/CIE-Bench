      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black-and-white stripe pattern without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the zebra continues to display its classic black-and-white stripes, which is a defining characteristic of zebras. There are no apparent changes or distortions to this pattern. The stripes are consistent and align with what is generally expected for a zebra's coat. By world knowledge, zebra stripes serve purposes like camouflage and identification, and there is no alteration to this visual trait in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the zebra still in its original standing posture facing slightly towards the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual evidence seen in Image B, the zebra is in a standing posture, facing slightly to the right side of the frame. This posture matches common standing poses for zebras in the wild where they might be alert or relaxed. The orientation towards the right is clear from the zebra's body direction and the position of its head.",

      "question": "Is the second zebra partially visible behind the first one, preserving its placement in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows part of another zebra visible behind the first zebra. This positioning suggests that the second zebra is either walking away or standing behind, maintaining its placement within the context of the scene. The visibility of only part of the zebra at the back is consistent with scenarios where animals are in groups within a grassy landscape.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a grassy savannah background with some scattered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B stays consistent with that of a grassy savannah, featuring scattered greenery typical of such environments. The distant vegetation adds depth and context, resembling landscapes in areas like African savannahs where zebras are commonly found. This maintaining of background provides a natural setting for the zebras.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the zebras' relative sizes, proportions, and perspectives maintained as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the size and proportions of the zebras appear unchanged, with no alteration in their relative dimensions to each other or the frame. The perspectives present give a realistic portrayal wherein the main zebra can be seen fully while the second one remains partially visible behind, maintaining consistency in how animals in such settings are generally captured.",
