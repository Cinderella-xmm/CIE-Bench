      "question": "Are the pink peony flowers with yellow centers still present in the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that the subject is adorned with pink peony flowers with yellow centers in the hair. These flowers are similar to the ones typically found in floral accessories used for decorative purposes in hair, providing a vivid and eye-catching element. This conclusion is reached by identifying the colors and shapes of these flowers.",

      "question": "Is the dark green high collar still visible on the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted wearing a green garment with a flowing green dress draped around them, creating an impression of a high collar effect. This was derived from the visible part of the outfit and its design. However, the specific high collar from Image A is replaced by this new outfit detail, leading to the conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lighting still soft and even, coming from the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears soft and evenly distributed across the scene. The even illumination can be inferred from the balance of light and shadow on the outfit, hair, and surrounding environment, all of which suggest a front-facing light source. This contributes to a gentle and harmonious aesthetic, confirming soft and even lighting.",

      "question": "Are the subject's eyes still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question of the eye color in Image B cannot be directly assessed due to the blurred area. Therefore, the question isn't applicable based on the visible elements of the image. The dark brown eyes in Image A cannot be confirmed in Image B because of the blur, leading to a conclusion based on available information.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject's face still centered in the frame with a frontal pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred area over the face, visual cues suggest that the subject's head and body positioning are centered in the frame, reflecting a frontal pose. This is evidenced by the symmetrical position of the shoulders and the natural alignment typical of a straightforward portrait composition. Therefore, the subject's pose can be inferred as frontal and centered.",
