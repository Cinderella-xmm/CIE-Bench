      "question": "Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat model has two sails: a larger triangular sail and a smaller triangular sail (jib) in front of it. The sails are positioned relative to each other as is typical for traditional sailing vessels, with the main sail mounted on the central mast and the jib attached in front towards the bow. This configuration suggests both sails are present and correctly positioned with respect to the mast.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a boat model with a single mast, positioned centrally along the length of the boat. This placement is typical for boats of this design, where a single mast supports the main sail. The mast's vertical position and central alignment match conventional mast setups.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boat model in Image B features a bow that is sharply pointed and extends forward from the hull, a common characteristic seen in traditional sailing boats which aids in cutting through water. The pointed, protruding bow is evident in the model's design, reflecting this typical nautical feature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat model has a midsection featuring an open-sided structure with vertical railings, covered by a canopy or similar covering. This is reflective of traditional boat structures designed for open-air but shaded passenger or cargo transport. The presence of these architectural elements on the midsection confirms their existence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small red flag attached to the stern of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no visual evidence of a small red flag attached at the stern (the rear part of the boat model). The absence of this element is noted by a lack of any flag-like object or color at the stern area in the presented design.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The alignment of the components such as sails, mast, and bow in Image B maintains the correct spatial configuration typical of a traditional sailing vessel. The sails are properly aligned relative to the mast, the deck layout is consistent with the hull's shape, and the pointed bow extends forward correctly. The proportions and orientations adhere to conventional designs, keeping them coherent and correctly aligned as expected in nautical engineering.",
