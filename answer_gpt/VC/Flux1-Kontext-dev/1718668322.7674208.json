    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the irises of the eyes still blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face, including the eyes, is blurred, making it impossible to determine the color of the irises based solely on visual cues. Common sense tells us that without visibility, the color cannot be conclusively identified.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and cheekbones, unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurry edit of the facial area in Image B prevents any assessment of facial structures such as the nose, jawline, and cheekbones. Therefore, conclusions about changes to these aspects cannot be made.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject positioned with a slight leftward turn of the body while facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body is positioned directly facing forward, which can be seen clearly by the symmetric armor and straight posture. The arms symmetrically align with the torso, strengthening the impression of a forward-facing position without any noticeable turn.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both arms positioned naturally at the sides of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both arms are positioned naturally at the sides of the body, which is a typical posture for someone standing upright. The visible placement of the arms in relation to the suit and body frame confirms this natural posture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the skin tone consistent with a natural light complexion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that the facial area is blurred in Image B, skin tone characteristics are indiscernible. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the skin tone based on provided visual cues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lips closed in a neutral expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face area is blurred in Image B, making it impossible to directly observe the lips or assess the facial expression. Without visibility, assumptions about the lips being closed or the expression being neutral cannot be verified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
