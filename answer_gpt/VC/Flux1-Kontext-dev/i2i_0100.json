      "question": "Are the cabinet doors and drawers designed in a shaker style in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side view of the cabinet clearly illustrates a shaker style with its simple, clean lines and recessed panels, which are indicative of this design. The depicted cabinet in the side view has rectangular shapes with no ornamentation, which is common to shaker style. Similarly, the top-down view shows a similar design for the doors and drawers, presuming the same style carries over. The consistent elements like recessed panels and simple lines from both views suggest they are designed in a shaker style.",

      "question": "Do both the top-down and side views show two rectangular sink basins with consistent dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a top-down view featuring a single rectangular sink. The side view highlights a single sink setup as well, with no indication of the presence of two sinks. There's no visual evidence or indication of a second basin in either view, thus concluding that the views do not show two rectangular sink basins. Additionally, the dimensions appear consistent for the single basin shown.",

      "question": "Are the black faucets present above each sink basin in both views with the correct orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the top-down view in Image B, there is a depiction of a black faucet above the sink. The side view also illustrates a black faucet above the sink with the orientation consistent and accurate for functioning. Both views maintain the correct orientation with the faucet handles and spout facing toward the sink. Therefore, in the single sink setup, the faucets are correctly placed.",

      "question": "Is the countertop depicted in both views as a light-colored marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-down view and the side view both show the countertops without any explicit texture details, appearing more as line drawings. Without color or texture details provided in these schematic representations, it is unclear whether they are intended to display a light-colored marble texture. Thus, the visual evidence does not support the notion of a marble texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compartments (drawers and cabinets) arranged in the same manner in both the top-down and side views, mirroring the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of drawers and cabinets in the side view is visible, with two doors beneath the sink and a drawer in the center. The top-down view is a schematic representation not showing doors or drawers in detail, so the layout cannot be fully validated against the side view, thus preventing a definitive comparison or conclusion that it mirrors the original Image A layout.",
