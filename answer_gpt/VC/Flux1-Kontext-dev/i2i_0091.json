      "question": "Is the original lighting style, including the placement and intensity of shadows, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B (the edited image), we observe that the light is coming from a window on the right side, creating shadows of the window frame on the wall and the floor. This suggests strong sunlight casting distinct lines and heightening the textures on the wall and floor. In Image A (the original image), the light also seems to originate from a similar right-side source as indicated by the shadows and highlights on the furniture and objects. Both images feature sunlight casting sharp shadows, implying that the overall lighting style, including the placement (direction) and intensity (sharpness) of shadows, remains preserved.",

      "question": "Are the items on the chest of drawers arranged in a similar fashion to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no chest of drawers evident; instead, the edited image features a plain wall and a plant. In Image A, the chest of drawers features plant decorations, books, and vases arranged symmetrically. Since Image B shows a completely different scene with no chest or similar arrangement, the answer is clearly negative. They are not arranged in a similar fashion, as the furniture itself is missing in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flooring in Image B appears to have a herringbone pattern, characteristic of parquet flooring, visible through the reflections of light coming through the window. Image A also has a similarly visible parquet flooring pattern when lighted. Both images depict parquet flooring, hence confirming its presence in both settings.",

      "question": "Is there a large piece of furniture serving as the primary storage unit in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible piece of furniture that acts as a storage unit; we only see a wall clock, wall openings and a potted plant. In Image A, a chest of drawers is prominently visible, serving as a storage unit. Image B doesn't depict any large furniture like the original image's chest of drawers, so there is no primary storage unit present.",

      "question": "Is natural light still illuminating the scene from the same direction as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the natural light enters from the window on the right, casting shadows to the left, similar to Image A, where natural light appears to flow from the right side, generating shadows to the left of objects. Since both images show light coming in from the same right-sided direction, with a similar shadow direction, the influence and entry of natural light remain consistent.",
