      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the large tree trunk with textured bark positioned on the left side of the image, partially obscuring the rear wheel of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large tree trunk is present on the left-hand side but it does not have textured bark, instead, it appears smooth, typical of cartoon representations. The tree trunk does not partially obscure the rear wheel of the bicycle; the bicycle is completely visible. Combining this observation with common knowledge of how trees and bicycles interact in physical space, the analysis shows that the tree trunk's position does not obscure the bicycle's rear wheel in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bicycle make direct contact with the tree trunk, leaning against it on its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the bicycle is positioned near the tree but does not make direct contact with the tree trunk. It stands independently rather than leaning against the tree trunk. In cartoon illustrations, bicycles often stand upright for stylistic reasons, as depicted here.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a continuous road stretching from the foreground into the background, aligned horizontally across the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a path can be seen extending from the foreground into the background, but it curves and is not aligned horizontally across the image. The road curves towards the right and blends into the animated landscape, which is common in cartoon depictions of outdoor scenes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three motorcyclists riding in a straight line along the road in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed three motorcyclists depicted in the background. However, they are not riding in a perfectly straight line. This deviation from a straight line is typical in cartoon illustrations to provide an element of dynamism and playfulness.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bicycle located on the left side of the image, with the road and motorcyclists positioned to the right and extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the bicycle on the left side of the frame, and the road, along with the motorcyclists, is positioned to the right and extends into the distance in a manner typical for creating depth in illustrations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rear wheel of the bicycle partially obscured by the tree trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear wheel of the bicycle is not obscured by the tree trunk as neither the tree nor its bark overlaps the bicycleâ€™s structure. The bicycle is fully visible, reinforcing the cartoonish style that doesn't require adherence to physical constraints.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a round headlight mounted on the front fork of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle features a round headlight mounted on its front fork, consistent with traditional bicycle designs in both reality and illustrated media. This detail enhances the bicycle's character in the animated environment.",
