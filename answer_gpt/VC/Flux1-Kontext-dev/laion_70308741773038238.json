      "question": "Is the winged \"B\" logo visible on the rear of the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle appears to be a hybrid design resembling both a car and a boat. It is displayed with a streamlined, yacht-like form. There is no traditional 'rear' as seen in conventional cars, but on the side of the vessel, a winged 'B' logo, which is commonly associated with Bentley, is visible. Due to the boat-like appearance, the rear section lacks a typical car layout where the logo might be expected. Therefore, for the question about the rear specifically, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Is the \"BENTLEY GREENWICH\" text visible on the rear license plate area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a vehicle modified to resemble a boat, which lacks any visible conventional rear license plate area. Instead, the design incorporates elements typical of marine vessels. Thus, there is no visible 'BENTLEY GREENWICH' text, indicative of the location and branding normally found on a car's license plate. The answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary surface tone is a silver metallic finish, which is consistent with what would be expected in luxury automobile design, particularly for a brand like Bentley. This appearance is emphasized by the reflective quality typical of metallic paint. The answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle designed to appear as a boat does not showcase a continuous chrome trim line along its lower side. Instead, it has design elements more associated with a boat hull, emphasizing smooth surfaces rather than the distinct lines typical of automotive chrome trim. The answer is No.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the vehicle resting on a circular black platform, similar to a showroom or display turntable, which provides a 360-degree view typical of such displays. This platform is present in both the car and yacht style presentations for continuity in showcasing the object. The answer is Yes.",
