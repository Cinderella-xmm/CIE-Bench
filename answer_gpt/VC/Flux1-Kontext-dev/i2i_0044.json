      "question": "Is the sandwich cross-section with layered ingredients clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the image is stylized in a cartoon manner, the sandwich's cross-section is depicted with distinct layers of ingredients, such as lettuce, cheese, and what appears to be meat. These layers are simplified compared to a realistic photograph but are still discernible due to the contrasts in color and shape characteristic of cartoon art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich bread is rendered with a bright orange color, resembling a golden-brown crust. Cartoons often use exaggerated colors to depict textures, and this bright hue suggests the crust's original golden-brown look.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the plate is depicted with an orange color, featuring wood grain lines typical of a wooden table. Cartoons often use solid colors and simple patterns to convey textures and materials.",
