    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three figures positioned such that one is on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are arranged with one prominently on the left side, one in the center, and one on the right side. This positioning aligns clearly with a standard layout of three individuals spaced apart, each holding a distinct position. The visual cues confirm this arrangement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central figure standing fully upright with both feet on the rock and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the central figure appears to be standing fully upright, maintaining a forward-facing stance, enhancing the sense of confidence and balance in posture. The visual cues of the upright body alignment and positioning of feet suggest this posture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been artistically altered to feature stylized skies and is no longer depicting traditional oceanic imagery or waves typical of a beach scene. Therefore, there are no visible waves or oceans; the background is wholly different.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground detail of dark, jagged rock formations is not clearly visible. The scene has been heavily edited to a fantasy setting, focusing more on the figures and stylized background, which masks any realistic details of rock formations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B indicates a stylized sunset that is positioned behind the arrangements, not specifically between the legs of the central figure as in the original image. The bright glow emanates but does not fit the same positioning as observed in natural settings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been stylized for a fantasy theme with dreamy and colorful skies replacing the ocean and horizon line, so there is no clear demarcation between sea and sky as there would traditionally be.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the figure on the right have long, wavy hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the figure on the right displays traits of long, wavy hair extending beyond the shoulders, maintaining an appearance that aligns with the expected style and length usually accompanying such a description.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the figure on the left have curly, light brown hair reaching past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure on the left exhibits curly, light brown hair extending past the shoulders. This visual characteristic is noticeable despite the fantastical elements, as it distinctly defines the figureâ€™s hair style and color.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
