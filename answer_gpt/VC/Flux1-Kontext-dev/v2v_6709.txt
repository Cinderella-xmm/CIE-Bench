    "Question": "Q1: Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle shows a body design with a faceted pattern made of Lego pieces. This pattern seems to mimic the original intricate star-shaped gradient pattern seen in Image A. The Lego version attempts to replicate the complex texture using its available geometry, so the interpretation of the pattern is proportionally consistent with the original faceted texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle has a similar overall shape to its depiction in Image A, maintaining the cylindrical form with tapered sides. Despite being constructed from LEGO, which naturally imposes a more blocky structure, the shape closely resembles the original design characteristics from Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold faceted spherical cap positioned at the top of the bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the bottle features a gold cap that resembles the shape and color of the one in Image A. It maintains the faceted and spherical design, indicating the style is preserved in the Lego version.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottleâ€™s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spray nozzle and visible mist plume are clearly depicted, similar to the original configuration in Image A. The nozzle sits at the neck, with a mist extending outward, which matches the setup seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a structured Lego background designed to mimic the fabric's flowing aesthetic seen in Image A. However, the replica is created with structured Lego pieces and represents an abstract interpretation rather than a direct replication of the fabric undulations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is styled to rest upon a constructed base made from yellow and black Lego pieces rather than on fabric, diverting arrangement sensibly from its original positioning atop folded fabric seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
    "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the gold cap looks proportionate to the bottle size. The Lego construction in Image B has managed to maintain this proportionality, ensuring the cap remains a visibly significant element compared to the bottle body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
