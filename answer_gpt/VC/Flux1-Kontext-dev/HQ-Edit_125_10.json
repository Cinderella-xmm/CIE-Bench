        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front of the ship clearly features a prow with the shape of a dragon's head, which has detailed carvings and an open jaw. The visual representation of a dragon's head at the prow of a Viking ship is a common historical motif, and in the edited image, this element is distinctly styled in a similar manner with intricate decoration, confirming the presence of such a feature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sail of the ship exhibits a prominent circular emblem in the center. The emblem is characterized by knotwork in dark red and black colors. The knot design is traditional and often associated with Norse or Viking art, contributing to its historical accuracy. The clear depiction of such an emblem in the middle of the sail confirms that the emblem is indeed centered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the side of the ship, beneath the oars, there are multiple circular shields visible. Each shield appears to have unique symbols on it, which is consistent with historical depictions of Viking ships. The shields are typically mounted to protect and signify the ship's identity. The pattern and diversity of symbols confirm their distinction.",

      "question": "Are there multiple oars extending outward from the hull, each connected to a small human-like figure representing a rower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one can observe several oars extending outward from the hull. Each oar seems to have a corresponding small human-like figure positioned near it, which represents a rower. The connection between oars and rowers is a common representation of Viking ships, depicting how they were manned and operated. The positioning and design of these figures affirm their presence and function in the image.",

      "question": "Does the hull consist of clearly defined horizontal wooden planks with visible grain and layered construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull of the ship is visibly constructed from horizontal wooden planks. Each plank is distinct, with visible wood grain contributing to a realistic portrayal of layered construction. This design is typical of traditional wooden shipbuilding, where overlapping planks create the sturdy body of the ship. The clear depiction of these planks in the image confirms the construction style.",

      "question": "Is there a single central mast supporting a square-shaped sail that is fully unfurled and attached via ropes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship has a single central mast from which a square-shaped sail is unfurled. The sail is fully extended, and ropes are visibly attached to it, securing it to the mast. This setup is a typical feature of Viking ships, allowing the sail to catch the wind efficiently. The overall rigging and sail placement corroborate the described configuration.",
