    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, centered between the two silhouetted landmasses, and appearing as a bright, circular disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is positioned low above the horizon, but there is also an imaginative element in the foreground with a tree-like structure and blue flowing elements which alter the focus. The sun does not appear as the main centered element due to the presence of the edited fantasy-like tree structure. This detailed structure distracts from the sun, changing the central composition compared to typical positioning found in sunsets.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two distinct silhouetted landmasses, one on the left and one on the right, framing the horizon and the sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of the landmasses on both sides are still present and frame the horizon and the fantastical edited object. The visual cues show these dark landmasses framing the unusual tree-like structure created in the foreground, maintaining their silhouetted appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the orange-red gradient of the sky, creating shimmering patterns that mirror the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface below the edited tree-like structure reflects the surrounding color palette of the sunset sky. However, there is an addition of blue glowing elements from the fantasy tree cascading into the water. Despite this, the overall water still captures part of the sunset coloration and effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky filled with a gradient of warm orange near the horizon transitioning to deeper red and maroon tones higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B shows a gradient transition where warm orange and red hues are visible near the horizon, changing to deeper crimson and maroon tones as it ascends. This matches the typical sunset coloration which is visually appealing and common knowledge in sunsets.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear, straight horizon line dividing the sky and water, with the sun resting directly on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horizon line in Image B is obscured by the addition of the edited fantastical tree-like structure with blue glowing elements flowing downwards, which disrupts the typical clear line separating the sky and water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there faint, thin clouds visible in the upper portion of the sky, partially illuminated by the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has faint clouds visible in the upper portions of the sky. These clouds are subtly lit by the sunset lighting, providing additional texture and depth to the sky, which is a common feature observed in sunset imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the water surface show gentle ripples and small waves, indicating calm movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the edited tree-like structure, the water surface beyond appears relatively calm with subtle ripples. The added elements do not change these underlying calm textures typical of evening waters, supporting peaceful motion.",
