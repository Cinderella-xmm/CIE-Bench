      "explanation": "The lighthouse in Image B shows a cylindrical structure that seems to have a tapering shape, meaning it narrows as it rises. The surface appears to be stone and exhibits signs of aging or weathering, which is a common feature of lighthouses that have been standing by the sea for a long time. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the lighthouse is cylindrical and weathered.",
