      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B (the edited image), the character is depicted with brown hair. This can be seen through the color and shading used for the hair, which aligns with a typical brown shade in illustrations. Since there's no indication of a color change through details such as highlights or alternative shading, it can reasonably be concluded that the character retains brown hair.",

      "correct_answer": "** Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the manga background includes grassy areas and trees, as visible in both panels.

        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown with the frisbee in both panels. In the first panel, the character holds the frisbee, as signified by the positioning of the hands and proximity to the object. In the second panel, the character appears to be preparing to throw the frisbee, indicated by the change in hand positioning and action lines suggesting motion. This confirms the interaction sequence of holding and preparing to throw.",
