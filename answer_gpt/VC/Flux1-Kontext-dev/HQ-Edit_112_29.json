      "question": "Does the edited image retain the three-masted structure of the ship, with one mast at the front, one in the center, and one at the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is encapsulated inside a globe. Despite this change in presentation, the ship retains its three-masted structure visibly. By observing the shadows and the outlines of the ship's masts, it is clear that the arrangement of one mast at the front, one in the center, and one at the rear is retained. This aligns with a traditional sailing ship design and reflects a similar structure as seen in many historical vessels.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B within the glass ball, the sails of the ship visually appear to maintain their dark blue color. This is determined by observing the color within the globe, with the blue hue of the sails clearly standing out against the other elements, such as the wooden structure of the ship and the background sky.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bow of the ship, observed under the transparent dome, retains ornate details. The presence of intricate carvings and scrollwork is still apparent, as these decorative elements are emphasized in their placement on the bow and are visually observable with rich detail and contrast.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B in detail within the confines of the globe, each of the three masts visibly supports multiple square sails arranged vertically. This characteristic is typical of a classic tall ship, where square sails are used to catch wind effectively, aligning with historical sail designs for optimal performance.",

The preserve of a tall, narrow hull and a pointed bow follows traditional sailing ship proportions, and these features remain recognizable, ensuring no drastic modification of the ship's shape has occurred in the edited presentation.",
