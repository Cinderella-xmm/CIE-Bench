      "question": "Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped object is visually presented as part of a comic illustration. The illustration maintains the typical circular form of a donut that is commonly recognized, characterized by a continuous round shape with a central hole, akin to a common donut. This can be identified by its placement in the image where donuts are stacked, maintaining their circular structure, which aligns with our world knowledge of what donuts typically look like.",

      "question": "Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The donuts depicted in Image B are illustrated in a cartoon style but retain the typical golden-brown color that is characteristic of baked donuts. This analysis is supported by the visual depiction of the donuts in the comic setting, which are colored with shades that mimic the appearance of a baked donut. Our world knowledge informs us that such hues are normal for properly baked donuts.",

      "question": "Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration does not depict visible coarse granulated sugar on the surface of the donuts. Instead, the focus is on the cartoon-like style, where sugar is not prominently highlighted in texture detail. Therefore, based on the visual cues provided in this illustration, the surface does not showcase granulated sugar as seen in realistic food photography.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible individual sugar granules on the donut’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration style of Image B does not depict any detailed textures or individual sugar granules on the donuts. The focus is on an artistic representation rather than granular detail. Therefore, the surface of the donut does not have visible individual sugar granules, as detail in a cartoon style is usually less specific compared to a photographic image.",

      "question": "Is the donut’s body formed as a continuous ring with a central opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the donuts maintaining a continuous ring shape with a central opening, a characteristic feature of typical donuts. This is reflected in the pile of donuts within the comic, where each donut has a central hole consistent with common representations of donuts. The comic accurately maintains the typical features of donuts despite being an artistic interpretation.",
