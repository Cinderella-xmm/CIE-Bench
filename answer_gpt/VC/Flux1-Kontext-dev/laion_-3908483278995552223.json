      "question": "Does the edited image retain the trident with exactly three sharp, symmetrical prongs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trident is indeed visible, held by the character. The trident exhibits three sharp and symmetrical prongs, aligning with traditional depictions of such weapons. This is evident from the visible sharp tips and evenly spaced prongs. By contrast, Image A also depicts a similar trident with the same characteristics, supporting the conclusion that Image B retains these features.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor displays clear geometric patterns composed of triangular and diamond-shaped plates throughout the chest, arms, and legs. These patterns provide a distinct texture, characteristic of the costume's intricate design. The visibility and repetition of these patterns indicate that they remain intact. Similarly, Image A shows the same patterns, confirming their presence and consistency in both images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the character's hair as long, wavy, and flowing over the shoulders, contributing to a dramatic and rugged appearance.
