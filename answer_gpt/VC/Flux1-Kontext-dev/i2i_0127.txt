    "Question": "Q1: Is the toilet still predominantly white in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet appears to be predominantly white in color, indicating a clean and typical toilet fixture. The visual cues show a standard western-style toilet with a white finish, which reflects common knowledge that toilets are often white due to ceramic material, providing an easy-to-clean surface. The words added to the image do not alter the toilet color, as they are overlay graphics that do not visually blend with the toilet itself.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the toilet lid still open?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet lid is clearly seen to be in an open position. The circular shape of the seating area is visible, and the lid is positioned upright, leaning against the cistern. Common understanding indicates that toilets with an open lid provide access for usage. The added text is placed away from the lid, so it does not obscure or change its position.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the flush tank still attached to the wall above the toilet?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the flush tank directly above the toilet bowl, adjacent to the wall. This placement is typical for standard toilets, where the tank is directly connected to provide flushing capability. Analyzing the image reveals that no alterations have been made to the tank's positioning in relation to the wall. The text overlay does not interfere with or change this structural element.",

This is evidenced by the distinct visual patterns and layouts of tiling, common in bathroom designs where ease of maintenance and neutral aesthetics are preferred. The consistency in appearance indicates no changes have been made from Image A in the tiling aspect. The text overlays do not affect the visibility or pattern of the tiles.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the toilet still positioned in the corner of the room?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet remains positioned in the corner of the room. This conclusion can be drawn from the visual layout, where the toilet is placed against two intersecting walls, a common space-saving arrangement in bathrooms. The added text does not impact the toilet's physical location within the room, as it is merely a graphical addition.",
