      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the locomotive retain its green color and the \"ROVES 1621\" label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive clearly displays a label with 'ROVES 1621' and maintains the green color scheme. This observation is based on visual cues from the locomotive itself, where the label and color are noticeable and unchanged in the edited version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the train still positioned on the tracks and heading towards the observer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the train on the tracks, with its frontal view facing the observer. The angle and orientation of the locomotive confirm that the train is indeed positioned on the tracks heading towards the observer, as indicated by the visible railway lines and the perspective from which the train is captured.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the reddish-brown vintage-style passenger cars still attached to the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rear section of the train, with several passenger cars, is visible and matches the reddish-brown vintage style seen in rail cars. The continuity of color and style confirms that these cars remain attached to the locomotive.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there still a group of people standing on the platform near the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to show a group of people gathered on the platform parallel to the train. These visual details, such as spatial positioning and the presence of a crowd, indicate that the group remains in place near the train, validating their presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting conditions and shadows still indicate late afternoon or early evening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The images show long shadows and a warm, diffused light, typical of late afternoon or early evening. The angle and intensity of shadows cast by objects like the train and platform canopy in Image B suggest a time of day consistent with those lighting conditions.",
