    "Question": "Q1: Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the skateboarder in the air with a crouched posture. The skater's arms are spread outward, which is a common skateboarding pose especially when airborne as it helps to maintain balance. The visual cues suggest a mid-air maneuver, typical of skateboarding tricks.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
    "explanation": "The angle of the skater's head in Image B indicates a focus toward the forward direction, which in the context of skateboarding would imply looking ahead towards the direction of travel to maintain control and foresee landing spots.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q6: Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a skatepark scene with multiple ramp structures. However, directly beneath the skater, the path appears flat, though adjacent ramps appear curved. The immediate foreground beneath the skater lacks the distinct bowl-like curve, typical in some skateparks but absent directly beneath.",
