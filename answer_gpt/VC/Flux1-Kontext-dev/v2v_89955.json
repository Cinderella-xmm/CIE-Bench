      "question": "Does the image retain the natural skin tones and creases of the human hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand appears realistic with natural skin tones and visible creases, suggesting that no color alterations have been made to the skin. Common knowledge tells us that if the skin retains its natural appearance, it's an indicator that its tones and textures have not been artificially altered.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird still positioned on the center of the palm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is placed in a similar position as in the center of a palm, utilizing common sense that the central area is where the palm lines converge and is the most flat spot to display art. Additionally, comparing with Image A, both images have the bird in the same central palm position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background still plain and neutral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the hand remains a simple, plain backdrop that doesn't interact with the main subject, drawing attention to the modification of the bird rather than other distractions. Typically, a plain background is one that lacks patterns, textures, or vibrant colors, and Image B matches this description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird retain its general swallow-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while additional details and colors have been added to make it more ornate, the bird figure still appears analogous to a swallow with its recognizable elongated body and wings. This observation aligns with known swallow characteristics. Upon comparison, unlike Image A's simpler depiction, the structure in Image B supports this outline alongside artistic embellishments.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fingers of the hand still slightly spread apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the fingers shows slight separation, similar to Image A, indicating that there have been no significant changes to the hand's natural open position. A slight spread apart of fingers is visible and expected when displaying the palm openly, which is confirmed in both images.",
