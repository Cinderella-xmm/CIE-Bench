      "question": "Is the horse depicted with its original white coat and blonde mane and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse features a white coat coupled with a blonde mane and tail. These visual cues are consistent with a typical portrayal of a horse, where lighter colors often signify purity or elegance, fitting common artistic depictions of horses. Without examining Image A, these visual details in Image B suggest the horse retains its original coloration, an indicative attribute of unchanged design.",

      "question": "Does the horse retain its posture of being in mid-gait?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is captured with its legs bent, likely depicting a mid-gait posture often associated with movement. This posture is typical in imagery meant to convey motion, as gait represents a dynamic form that indicates the horse is in motion. Without referencing Image A, the visual depiction in Image B resembles a horse in mid-gait posture.",

      "question": "Are the horse's original hooves visible and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B independently, the horse's hooves are visible and appear in natural coloration typical for horses, usually darker or matching their coat color. Given no evident alterations in texture or form, one can assert that these hooves appear unchanged from a classical representation of equine hooves. Evaluating Image A confirms this unchanged likeness.",

      "question": "Is the horse's body proportion consistent with its original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's body proportion appears to reflect a typical equine build, characterized by a muscular physique and proportionate bodily alignment. These features are commonly seen in artistic or realistic portrayals of horses, where anatomical accuracy is emphasized. Once compared with Image A, it reveals that Image B retains the original proportionality of the horse's body.",

      "question": "Are the horse's eyes and facial expression unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the horse with eyes that appear large and expressive, and the facial expression remains neutral or attentive. These traits harmonize with traditional portrayals of horses where such facial expressions are major identifiers of natural behavior. Observing Image A further confirms the unaltered state of the horse's eyes and facial expression when compared to Image B.",
