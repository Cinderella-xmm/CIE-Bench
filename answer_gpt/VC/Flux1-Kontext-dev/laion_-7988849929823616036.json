        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial area is blurred, making it impossible to determine the presence or shape of a mustache. Consequently, it cannot be confirmed whether there is a mustache with upward curls at the ends.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is entirely blurred, obscuring any facial features such as eyes or the nose, thus making it impossible to assess their symmetry or alignment.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
