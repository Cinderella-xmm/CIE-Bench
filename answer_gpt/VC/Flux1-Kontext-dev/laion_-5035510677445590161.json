      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with a long, curly, voluminous white beard extending to the front of the chest. This is consistent with a common portrayal of Santa Claus, where such a beard is part of the character's traditional look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no visible thin-rimmed glasses appear on the face. The absence of glasses can be concluded from observing that no spectacles are perched over the nose or eyes of the character depicted.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right arm of the character is extended outward; however, the palm is not facing upward, it is facing forward or slightly facing downward, and the fingers are not noticeable. Thus, this posture does not match the description given in the question.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, the character's head appears to be positioned generally forward with a very slight turn, consistent with a typical posture when gesturing or waving outward.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features including the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks are not visible due to the blurred effect applied over the face. Therefore, consistency with Image A cannot be assessed.",
