    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the toe box of the boot rounded?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toe box in Image B is observed to have an angular shape, which is more typical of boots with a square or rectangular toe rather than a rounded one. Rounded toe boxes generally have a more circular or oval appearance, lacking edges that define a square shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the boot have a V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot shows a distinct V-shaped opening at the top of the shaft. This is identified by the sharp indentation that forms a V-like shape between the front and back sections of the shaft, which is a common style feature in cowboy boots.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a continuous white piping running vertically along the outer side of the shaft from the heel to the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit white piping along the outer side of the shaft. The shaft displays decorative patterns without any piping, which would typically appear as a thin line of contrasting color running vertically along the seam.",

      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly features intricate decorative patterns both on the upper shaft and the vamp (the front part of the boot). These designs are embossed and richly detailed, covering both areas of the boot, adding to its ornamental appearance.",

      "question": "Is there a distinct heel block elevating the rear of the boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B has a noticeable heel block, which is clearly higher than the part where the foot would sit flat. This heel block gives the boot a raised rear, typical of cowboy boots, which often have elevated heels for style and function.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the surface of the boot exhibit visible texture resembling leather grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface appears smooth and metallic, lacking the type of texture associated with leather grain. Leather grain usually consists of small, uneven patterns or wrinkles that are characteristic of natural leather surfaces, whereas the boot here looks shiny and polished.",
