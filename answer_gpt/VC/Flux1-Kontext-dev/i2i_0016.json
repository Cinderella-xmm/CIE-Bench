      "question": "Do both players retain identifiable clothing (white shirts and shorts, white tank top with black bottoms) and hairstyles in the chibi version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi version (Image B), the characters are depicted in simplified, cartoon-like forms. The male character is wearing a white shirt with blue shorts, and the female character is wearing a white tank top with a dark skirt. This is similar to Image A, where both players wear white tops with dark bottoms: the player in shorts and the other in a skirt. Additionally, the hairstyles are simplified but recognizable: short hair for the male and longer hair for the female. Thus, the clothing and hairstyles are identifiable but adapted to fit the chibi style.",

      "question": "Are both players still holding tennis rackets in the chibi rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each chibi character is depicted holding a tennis racket. This aligns with Image A, where both players are also holding rackets. The common visual cue of a tennis player holding a racket is maintained in the chibi version, despite the stylized representation.",

      "question": "Is the handshake pose still maintained between the two chibi players over the net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two chibi characters are shown shaking hands. While there is no visible net due to the chibi style's simplification, the gesture indicates a post-match handshake, commonly done over the net. In Image A, the players are clearly shaking hands over a net. Therefore, the handshake pose is retained in spirit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visual elements such as tennis balls or a net present in the depiction. The focus is solely on the chibi characters themselves, without any tennis equipment or court elements in the frame. Image A includes both tennis balls and a net, positioned appropriately according to a real tennis setup. Therefore, these elements are not retained in the chibi version.",

      "question": "Does the background still depict an outdoor tennis court or at least retain visual hints of it (e.g., court lines, fencing)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not show any elements associated with a tennis court, such as lines or fencing. It is a simple, circular design with an emblematic representation of a tennis court in the circle but without real visual elements or hints of an outdoor tennis court that are present in Image A, like court lines or fencing. Therefore, there are no direct visual cues of an outdoor tennis court in Image B.",
