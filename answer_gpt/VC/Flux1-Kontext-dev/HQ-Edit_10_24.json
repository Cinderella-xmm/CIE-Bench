      "question": "Is the girl’s mouth visibly open with red lips and rosy cheeks, indicating she is blowing bubbles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's face is blurred, which obscures the view of her mouth, lips, and any possible expression such as blowing bubbles. Thus, it cannot be determined from Image B if her mouth is open or her lips are red and cheeks rosy.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl has long black hair that appears wavy. However, due to the blurring of the face, it is impossible to tell if bangs cover her forehead.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the face is blurred, the girl’s head is tilted slightly upward, and based on her body position, she is likely in a side profile.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bubbles appear to be floating around, but there are no visual cues indicating they are emerging directly from the girl's mouth due to the blurring. Therefore, bubbles are not visibly blowing from her mouth.",
