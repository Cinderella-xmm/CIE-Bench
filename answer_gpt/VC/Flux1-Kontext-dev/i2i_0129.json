      "question": "Does the surfer maintain his original balancing posture on the manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is standing on a large shark, not a manta ray, and his posture appears consistent as he's balancing while standing. The visual information indicates that despite the addition of the shark, the surfer’s posture remains unchanged from what could be expected on a surfboard. Since no manta ray is involved and his posture remains like that of a surfer’s balance, the correct answer based on the posture would still be evaluated by the visual cues of balance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original wave formation preserved, with the surfer riding on top of it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large shark inserted under the surfer, but the wave formation and the surfer riding it remain visually consistent with what would be expected in surfing imagery. The overall shaping and visual structure of the wave appear intact despite the addition of the shark, suggesting that the wave formation is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ocean waters around the wave consistent with their appearance in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B's visual cues, the ocean waters around the wave are shown to be calm and reflective of typical surf conditions, similar to those expected in Image A. The presence of a shark does not alter the appearance of the water itself surrounding the wave area. Thus, the ocean waters maintain their consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horizon line and clear sky from the original image retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B shows that the horizon line remains visible and the clear blue sky is still present, undisturbed by the addition of the shark. This visual consistency indicates that the horizon line and sky have been retained as expected from classic beach imagery.",

      "question": "Does the surfer still wear black swim shorts and remain shirtless as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is indeed seen wearing black swim shorts and is shirtless, matching the appearance usually attributed to surfers in swim attire for optimal movement and balance. There is no visible change in his clothing or state of dress from what the analysis would expect from surfing scenes.",
