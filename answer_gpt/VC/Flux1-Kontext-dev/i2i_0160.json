      "question": "Do the birds retain their original feather patterns including the brown and white colors and striated wing markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds maintain their distinct feather patterns with visible brown and white coloring, as well as the striated markings on their wings. The detailed appearance of the feather patterns suggests fidelity to the original bird design commonly seen in this type of bird. The visual cues indicate consistency with typical bird plumage including color variations and wing markings.",

      "question": "Are the birds still perched on the branch with their beaks open as if singing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are depicted clearly perched on the same branch as seen in Image A, and both have their beaks open. This suggests the same posture, commonly associated with birds singing or vocalizing, indicating continuity in their positioning and behavior between the two images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the branch still present with the same structure and positioning beneath the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch structure supporting the birds in Image B is consistent with the original image. Comparative analysis confirms the placement and form of the branch is unchanged, based on the alignment and positioning beneath the birds, retaining original physical characteristics and placement under them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays leaves with consistent shapes and positions around the birds. The leaves on the left show similar form and placement to Image A, suggesting no alterations in their arrangement, maintaining visual consistency with respect to location and configuration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite a significant change in background to a night scene with moonlight, the birds are still well-illuminated, allowing their features to be highlighted. This is achieved through ambient lighting effects similar to the original image, ensuring the integrity of their visual presentation in terms of detail and clarity remains despite differing background lighting sources.",
