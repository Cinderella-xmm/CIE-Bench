    "Question": "Q1: Are the wooden truss supports of the railway bridge clearly visible and structurally intact?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the railway bridge supports are illuminated and outlined in neon colors, which emphasizes their structure and visibility. The visual effect suggests intactness, as the neon outlines are uniform and clearly defined. Neon visuals often enhance the perception of clarity and intactness due to the defined lines and vibrant glow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the river present and flowing continuously beneath the bridge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the region beneath the bridge has been transformed with neon effects that suggest the presence of a body of water. The continuous neon flow along the river path symbolizes the flowing nature of a river, thereby indicating continuity. The neon portrayal mirrors traditional water reflections, enhancing the perception of flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red-brick buildings with gabled roofs and chimneys visible in the park area?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows structures with neon outlines in the park area, which represents red-brick buildings with gabled roofs, similar to typical architectural styles identified in historical or traditional settings. Their structural shape and placement match commonly identifiable features, such as roofs and chimneys, turned into neon effects in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the green lawns and paved pathways in the park area clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the green lawns are represented with blue neon, and the pathways are outlined with distinct neon lines. This visual trick maintains the concept of lawns and pathways through its color effect, serving as a replacement for traditional green coloring under neon effects, which is commonly adopted to maintain shape visibility in different palettes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the city skyline located behind the river and bridge, maintaining the original depth order?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the city skyline illuminated in neon lights behind the bridge and river area. The spatial arrangement in the edited image retains the depth perspective, displaying the skyline further from the viewer which is consistent with typical urban layouts that situate skylines behind foreground elements like bridges and rivers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are two parallel railroad tracks visible along the length of the bridge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the neon effects enhance the bridge's structural visibility, there is a lack of distinct parallel rail patterns akin to railroad tracks. This lack of differentiation between the tracks in the neon illustration suggests that tracks are not distinctly outlined or visible.",
    "answer": "No"
