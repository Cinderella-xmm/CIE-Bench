      "question": "Are the thick, textured brushstrokes of the original painting retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflowers are depicted in a real-life setting on a kitchen table, suggesting an attempt to bring the painting into a 3D environment. However, the visual style of the sunflowers and vase still exhibit the painted style with distinct contours and brushstroke effects. This indicates that while the setting has changed, the texture and style are reminiscent of Van Gogh's work with noticeable painted effect lines, suggesting the retention of the texture, albeit possibly in a more subtle or different form due to the change in medium.",

      "question": "Is the bright golden yellow color of the sunflowers preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflowers have a vivid golden yellow color that matches what is typically seen in Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers.' This consistency in coloration suggests that the bright golden hue is preserved from the original painting to the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the off-white and yellow color of the vase, including the handwritten signature \"Vincent,\" retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase clearly retains the off-white and yellow colors visible on its surface, consistent with the style and coloring of Van Gogh's original vase. The signature 'Vincent' is also discernible on the vase, indicating that not only the color scheme but also the characteristic signature is preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the sunflowers positioned in the vase as they were originally, maintaining their natural arrangement and angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the sunflowers in the vase is notably similar to their positioning in Image A. The angles, overlaps, and general positioning appear consistent, indicating the preservation of their natural arrangement despite the change in background setting.",

      "question": "Are the natural placements of the leaves and stems, including their green color and texture, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves and stems of the sunflowers maintain a green color, similar to those in the original painting. Their positioning relative to the flowers and vase, and their texture reflect the visual character of a painted aesthetic. This suggests that their placement and textural attributes are preserved, despite being placed in a photorealistic setting.",
