        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ossicones are the horn-like protrusions on a giraffe's head. In the image of the edited nesting dolls, the largest doll has visible ossicones. This indicates that the edited image includes this feature, mimicking one of the distinct characteristics of giraffes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features nesting dolls with a shape typical of such dolls, which are rounded and compact. The necks of the dolls are not elongated, which is a distinguishing feature of giraffes. Therefore, they do not resemble the elongated necks of giraffes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the nesting dolls are organized from the largest to the smallest, creating a clear downward gradient in size. This typical arrangement for nesting dolls indicates a descending order from left to right on the table.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in the image have a typical rounded base, characteristic of such dolls, allowing them to stand flat on a surface. They do not possess legs, long or otherwise, and hence they do not mimic the long legs of a giraffe.",
