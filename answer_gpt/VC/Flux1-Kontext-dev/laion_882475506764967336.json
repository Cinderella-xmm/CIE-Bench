      "question": "Are there exactly six chairs surrounding the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there are six chairs placed around the table. This includes four single chairs and one bench-like seat on each of the remaining sides, visually confirming the count of six individual seating spaces. Combining this count with common sense understanding that each single chair and the bench-like piece can serve as individual seating options, we conclude that there are six chairs surrounding the table.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the table square in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the table in the edited image appears to be equally sided, resembling a square. The visual cues show equal lengths on all sides which is consistent with the geometrical definition of a square. Thus, the table is concluded to be square in shape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two chairs on each long side of the table and one chair on each short side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two chairs on one side, two on another opposite side, and rather than two single chairs on the remaining sides, there is a bench-like structure that could possibly hold two people, indicating a different configuration than stipulated in the question. Therefore, there are not exactly two chairs on each of the long sides and one chair on each short side of the table.",

      "question": "Do the chairs on the long sides of the table have armrests?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the seating arrangement in Image B, the two chairs directly visible in the foreground of the image have visible armrests. This confirms that the chairs on the long sides of the table do indeed have armrests.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Centered on the table in Image B, there is a round, black object with a green part that visually suggests a plant or decoration, which would serve as a centerpiece. Hence, there is a centerpiece located in the center of the table.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the furniture is located on a studded, grey base plate, typical of LEGO-style surfaces, which represents a flat and level surface in this style of model representation.",
