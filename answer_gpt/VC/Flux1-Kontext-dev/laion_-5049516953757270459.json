      "question": "Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food is arranged on a wooden board with rounded sides forming the shape of a heart. Common sense tells us that the heart shape typically includes a v-shaped bottom point and a curved top. The shape in Image B is not a geometric perfect heart, as it is more naturalistic in appearance with slight imperfections. Thus, the conclusion based on visual cues is that while it is heart-shaped, it may not function as a 'perfect' heart due to these natural imperfections.",

      "question": "Is the avocado shown as half-cut with the pit cavity visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the avocado is visibly cut in half with the interior flesh and the cavity where the pit would be clearly exposed. This common method of avocado presentation involves slicing the avocado longitudinally to reveal the seed cavity. Using world knowledge of how avocados are typically halved, and what that looks like, supports the observation that the pit cavity is indeed visible.",

      "question": "Are the asparagus stalks bundled together with a visible twine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the asparagus stalks are grouped together and tied around the base, appearing to be secured with a twine or similar material. This matches commonly used techniques for displaying or selling asparagus, where the stalks are often bound to keep them organized. The visual cue of the bundle supports the conclusion that they are indeed tied together.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries grouped together at the top-left of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we see several berries—blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries—are arranged close to each other within the top-left section of the heart shape. This grouping logic follows common display settings for fruits, where similar types are placed together. Thus, based on their arrangement, these fruits appear grouped as described.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a single red onion positioned near the broccoli and garlic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a single red onion placed to the right of the arrangement, which is visually proximal to both a piece of broccoli and a garlic bulb. Using common organization arrangements, onions, broccoli, and garlic are often clustered due to their typical culinary uses and visual colors even though they vary in texture and flavor. This supports the visual confirmation that the onion is near the broccoli and garlic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three white mushrooms grouped together near the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several white mushrooms are seen grouped towards the center-right area of the heart arrangement. The visual count shows three white mushrooms distinctly visible in close proximity. This matches the typical grouping of mushrooms, making them easily accessible for culinary applications, thus confirming the presence of at least three.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a large red bell pepper at the bottom-right of the heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, a large red bell pepper is captured near the bottom-right edge of the heart-shaped arrangement. Bell peppers are commonly recognizable by their bulging lobes and shiny red hue, which is evident in the visual cues provided. This prominent red pepper supports the interpretation that there is indeed a red bell pepper situated as described.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {

      "question": "Is the background a neutral gray surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface behind the heart-shaped food arrangement is a plain, smooth, neutral-colored backdrop that appears to be gray. This contextually neutral setting is often chosen to help the vibrant colors of the food stand out. Based on the lack of interfering patterns or colors, the conclusion is that the background is indeed a neutral gray surface.",
