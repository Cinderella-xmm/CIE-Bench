      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van is depicted with a green body, a cream-colored roof, and beige trim along the lower edge and around the windows. The visual cues of these colors correspond with common representations of vans, particularly those often used for road trips. My world knowledge about vans and their typical color schemes in illustrations helps confirm this description based on the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the van features a wooden luggage rack mounted on the roof. This detail is visible from the depiction of the rack structure on top of the van.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the van with a characteristic rounded front design, indicative of many older van models. The depiction includes two large windshield windows, typical of many van designs where visibility is prioritized for drivers. This analysis is supported by my world knowledge of van designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van showcases round headlights and a chrome bumper, typical features of many classic van designs. These elements are visually apparent and further indicated by my world knowledge, which identifies these elements as common automotive features for older-model vans.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the van in a frontal perspective rather than the isometric (angled top-down) view. Isometric views typically provide a more comprehensive angle and show multiple sides simultaneously, which is not reflected here as the image provides a side-front view.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment and van predominantly feature warm tones such as yellows, greens, and browns. These colors are often associated with arid and desert landscapes, providing a visually cohesive and thematic setting. My understanding of color theory and warm versus cool tones aids in recognizing this.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains several stylized green cacti, not brown ones. The depiction shows these cacti in a typical desert setting, but they are not brown as the question suggests but are rather a more conventional green, indicative of standard cactus representations.",
