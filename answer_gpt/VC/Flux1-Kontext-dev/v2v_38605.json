      "question": "Does the edited image retain the dynamic posture of the subject, showing a forward-leaning stance with bent knees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject is pictured in a posture that indicates movement and balance, which is common in both skiing and surfing. The subject displays a forward-leaning stance with bent knees, a dynamic pose typically seen in activities requiring balance and agility. This is consistent with the original image, where the skier has a similar stance to maintain balance on the snow.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the subject's hands interacting with the surfboard in a manner consistent with surfing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject is holding ski poles, which would not be consistent with the typical surfing position where hands might be outstretched or touching the surfboard for balance. Despite being on water, the subject's hands gripping ski poles suggest the retention of the skiing elements rather than transition to surfing mechanics.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the skier's attire in some form, such as a wetsuit or beach-appropriate clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject is wearing a red jacket and black pants, which are the same as the skiing attire from the original image. This attire is not typical for a beach or surfing environment, where lighter or swim-appropriate clothing would normally be expected. The edited image retains the skier's attire, indicating no change in clothes appropriate for a beach setting.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include some form of protective gear on the subject, such as a helmet or goggles adapted for surfing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject is wearing a helmet, much like in the original skiing image. However, helmets are not typically used in surfing, where other forms of protective gear like rash guards or special surfing helmets might be more common. The protective gear retained is not specifically adapted for surfing, rather it is consistent with the skiing theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a bright and vibrant color scheme, including a vivid blue ocean and clear sky, as well as colorful palm trees, all of which contribute to a lively and energetic tropical beach setting. This is indicative of an atmosphere typically associated with tropical locales, contrasting with the colder, more monochromatic tones of a snowy landscape in the original image.",
