      "question": "Is the diamond-cut pattern on the decanter preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the decanter is analyzed, and although there are attempts at some patterning, the intricate diamond-cut pattern seen in real glassware is not preserved. The edited image simplifies the texture, which resembles a carved or molded look without the precision of real cut glass.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drink in the glass has a smooth, slightly raised white layer on top, resembling foam. This suggests the presence of a foam-like texture, similar to that formed by carbonation in beverages.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace shows glowing orange shapes that resemble stylized flames and embers. These visual cues suggest the depiction of a warm fire.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle opener maintains a shape similar to the one found in Image A, including the D-shaped opening and elongated handle. This indicates that the original form has been preserved.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement of the objects shows the decanter to the right of the glass, with the opener placed in front. This placement matches the original positioning observed in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the wooden table surface with visible grain texture present beneath the objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table surface appears simplified and does not show the detailed wood grain texture seen in Image A. Instead, it has a more uniform, cartoon-like depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the liquid level in the glass approximately near the rim, and in the decanter about halfway up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the liquid in the glass reaches near the top, indicating a level close to the rim. In the decanter, however, the liquid appears more stylized, and the height resembles halfway but lacks precise measurement visibility.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a simplified rendition of the brick pattern surrounding the fireplace, keeping the visual essence of a brickwork arrangement from Image A.",
