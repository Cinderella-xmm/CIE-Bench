      "question": "Is the wide, straight avenue leading directly toward the base of the Eiffel Tower preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a perfume bottle with the view of the avenue leading directly to the Eiffel Tower visible through its translucent surface. The bottle integrates the view of Image A, maintaining the appearance of the wide, straight avenue leading towards the tower, creating an artistic effect on the bottle's surface. Thus, the avenue itself is preserved in Image B. In Image A, the avenue directly leads to the Eiffel Tower. By combining both observations, it is clear that the avenue is preserved in Image B within the artistic context of the bottle.",

      "question": "Are the symmetrical rows of green trees lining both sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the area surrounding the Eiffel Tower through a transparent bottle, and the symmetrical rows of green trees are visible leading up to the Eiffel Tower. In this artistic representation, the symmetrical alignment of the trees is depicted in Image B, similar to Image A. This preservation is seen through the bottle's surface visualizing the original scene.",

      "question": "Are the streetlights positioned along the sides of the avenue preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlights along the sides of the avenue can still be seen through the transparent depiction on the perfume bottle. Their positioning remains consistent with the actual image from Image A, where streetlights line the avenue. The transfer to the bottle maintains these key details of the symmetrical arrangement along the avenue.",

      "question": "Is the wet asphalt surface with visible reflections preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures the reflective nature of the wet asphalt surface through the illustration on the bottle. The reflections are depicted as they appear in the original scene from Image A. This preservation indicates the realistic effect of wet asphalt and its reflective quality transferred well onto the perfume bottle's depiction.",

      "question": "Is the overcast sky with dark, layered clouds preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overcast sky with its dark, layered clouds is clearly visible in the background and carried through onto the bottle's external and internal surfaces. This matches the atmospheric conditions captured in Image A. Therefore, the overcast sky is maintained in the edited image as part of the artistic rendition.",

      "question": "Is the distant Parisian skyline with identifiable rooftops and modern high-rises preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits the distant Parisian skyline, visible through the bottle's surface. The elements such as rooftops and modern high-rises show continuity in the design from Image A, where the skyline forms a critical part of the scenery. The preservation of these skyline elements in Image B indicates a detailed view adapted into the artistic setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vehicles, including cars and a bus visible on the road in Image A, are not preserved in Image B. The edited image emphasizes the aesthetic features of the scene without including the traffic details visible in the original image. The artistic rendering on the perfume bottle has removed these elements to focus on landscape and architectural features.",
