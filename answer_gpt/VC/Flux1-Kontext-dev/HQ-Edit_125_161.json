      "question": "Is the herringbone-patterned wooden floor present and accurately rendered in the same layout and orientation as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the herringbone-patterned wooden floor is clearly visible and retains the same layout and orientation seen in Image A. By examining the uniform arrangement of wooden planks and the specific angular orientation characteristic of herringbone patterns, it's evident that no changes were made in this region of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical and horizontal moldings of the wall paneling preserved, including the recessed rectangular panels and crown molding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall paneling, including the vertical and horizontal moldings, recessed rectangular panels, and crown molding, are preserved consistently as they were in Image A. The details of the moldings and the shapes of the panels remain unchanged, indicating that the architectural features of the wall were maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the oval-shaped skylight or oculus at the top of the spiral staircase still present and positioned centrally above the coil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the oval-shaped skylight is still present and positioned centrally above the staircase, consistent with its placement in Image A. The central positioning and characteristic oval shape have not been altered.",

      "question": "Is the graphite pencil visible in the lower-right corner of the image, angled diagonally across the drawingâ€™s border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the graphite pencil in the lower-right corner, angled diagonally just as it is in Image A. The pencil's position relative to the drawing's border has been preserved, maintaining the same angle and placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thin ruled border is visible, enclosing the drawing with short perpendicular lines at each corner, identical to Image A. This framing feature remains unaltered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the perspective of the scene maintain convergence toward the oval skylight at the top, with all architectural lines aligning accordingly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perspective in Image B continues to converge towards the oval skylight at the top, and architectural lines align toward this focal point, as seen in Image A. The perspective's integrity and its convergence point have been maintained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tonal gradients on the walls and floor, particularly the darker shadows near the base and lighter areas under the skylight, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tonal gradients on the walls and floor are consistent with those in Image A, showing darker shadows near the base and lighter areas closer to the skylight. These shading techniques create depth and were not altered in the editing process.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individual wooden planks in Image B are rendered with fine parallel lines, indicating texture and grain, just as they appear in Image A. This level of detail remains unchanged, effectively conveying the wooden floor's texture.",
