    "Question": "Q2: Is there a pointed arch window with decorative tracery visible on the upper part of the brick building?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows an architectural detail resembling a pointed arch shape on the brick building, which typically suggests gothic-style windows or decorative features. This aligns with common stylistic elements found in older or historic buildings, where decorative tracery is often used. While it may not be a fully functional window, it has the characteristics associated with this architectural style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the building have a visible corner formed by two intersecting brick walls meeting at a right angle?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the structure of the building where two brick walls meet at a right angle, forming a distinct corner. This is evident from the way the brick pattern bends around this corner, transitioning from one wall to the next. Such architectural intersections are common in building designs to maximize space and create defined structural lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there at least three distinct rose buds visible along the stems, including one with pink tips near the center of the image?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, at least three rose buds can be seen. These buds are less developed than full blooms, indicated by their compact petals and smaller size. One bud near the center has noticeable pink tips, contrasting against whiter petals, showcasing variation in bloom stages common in rose bushes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there dark green, serrated leaves present along the stems of the rose bush?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays dark green, serrated leaves prominently along the stems of the rose bush, a characteristic feature of rose plants. These leaves provide necessary foliage that supports the flowers and are easily identified by their sharp, serrated edges, a typical botanical trait.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the roses positioned in front of the brick building, creating a clear foreground-background separation?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows roses in the foreground, positioned distinctly in front of the brick building in the background. This separation is evident from the focal contrast and placement of objects, where the flowers appear closer to the viewer and the building provides a backdrop. Such spatial arrangement leads to a clear visual distinction between foreground and background elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a tall, vertical brick structure (buttress or tower) extending upward on the left side of the building?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the building features a tall, vertical brick structure, indicating architectural components like a buttress or tower. This extension rises vertically, typical in buildings designed for structural support or aesthetic prominence. Vertical elements are often used to emphasize height and add architectural interest to a facade.",
    "answer": "Yes"
