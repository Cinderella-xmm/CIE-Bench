    "Question": "Q1: Are the refrigerators depicted with a stainless steel finish and reflective surface texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerators have a metallic sheen typical of a stainless steel finish, which is smooth and often reflective. This is discerned by the way light interacts with the surface, producing clear reflections and a uniform metallic appearance. Commonly, stainless steel is chosen for its sleek, modern look and is reflective. Thus, based on their appearance, the choice indicates they are indeed stainless steel with a reflective surface.",
