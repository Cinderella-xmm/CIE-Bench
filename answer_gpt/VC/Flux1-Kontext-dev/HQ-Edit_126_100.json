      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is visible on the edge of the path, facing away from the house, maintaining the same posture as seen in Image A. This indicates that the child's position has not changed between the images. Therefore, despite changes in other elements of the house, the child remains seated as described.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved concrete path extend from the bottom right corner of the image toward the house without deviation or interruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images show a concrete path that extends from the bottom right corner towards the house uninterrupted. The path has a slight curve which remains consistent across Image A and Image B, without any deviation or interruption introduced in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof visible to the left of the main house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof is visible to the left of the creatively altered house. This building is consistent with the one also visible in Image A, indicating no change to this element in the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the large green banana leaves and the cluster of bright orange flowers clearly visible in the foreground, just below the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the foreground features of large green banana leaves and a cluster of bright orange flowers seen in Image A. These elements provide continuity in front of the altered house and are clearly visible below the structure.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish located on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward from the structure on a black metal pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The satellite dish in Image B is positioned similarly to Image A, on the right side of the upper floor. It extends outward from the structure supported by a black metal pole, reinforcing its unchanged placement in the scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lower ends of the stilts firmly planted in the soil along the slope beneath the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the conventional stilts from Image A are replaced by tree-like roots supporting the house, suggesting an imaginative alteration rather than stilts traditionally planted into the ground. This marks a significant deviation from Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the natural landscape seen in Image A, with rolling green hills covered in dense forest, fading into mist. The backdrop of a partly cloudy blue sky is consistent in both images, ensuring continuity of the surrounding environment.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show distinct clusters of bright orange flowers near the base of the structure, adjacent to the banana plant. These plants remain a consistent element despite the architectural alterations in Image B.",
