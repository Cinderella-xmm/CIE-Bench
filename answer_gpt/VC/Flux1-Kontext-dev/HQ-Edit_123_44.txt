    "Question": "Q1: Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the U.S. national insignia can be observed on the wings of the aircraft in the form of a white star within a circular blue background. However, the red and white bars that typically flank this insignia are not visible, implying a partial insignia. The same insignia appears on the fuselage. This indicates some representation of the U.S. national insignia is present, although not fully detailed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two prominent structures underneath the wings of the aircraft, which resemble radial engines. These engines are symmetrically placed, one beneath each wing, which aligns with the typical placement for twin-engine aircraft. They appear visually similar to engine casings seen on many classic military aircraft.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, each of the radial engines beneath the wings is clearly attached with a propeller that consists of three distinct blades. This structure is typical for propeller-driven aircraft engines, aiding in their ability to generate thrust.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front section of the aircraft's fuselage features a rounded, clear structure, which is consistent in design and placement with a cockpit canopy. Its transparency is indicative of a viewing area for the pilot/navigator, characteristic of many aircraft designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the aircraft extend symmetrically from the central fuselage, and they appear to be relatively straight with no apparent upward or downward angle forming a dihedral, which is an upward angle from the horizontal plane of the wings. In this depiction, the wings appear to be parallel to one another, with no dihedral angle visible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the aircraft's tail section in Image B, it comprises a central vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers extending horizontally. These horizontal components appear to include smaller fin-like structures at their ends, which is typical for ensuring lateral stability in many aircraft designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
