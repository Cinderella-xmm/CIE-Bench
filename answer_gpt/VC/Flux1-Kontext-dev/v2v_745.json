      "question": "Does each character still carry or interact with travel-related luggage such as suitcases or backpacks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters, depicted in Chibi form, show a range of expressions and actions related to reading. Unlike Image A, where characters are clearly interacting with luggage, these versions do not feature any travel-related items like suitcases or backpacks. In the Chibi representations, there's a strong focus on facial expressions and minimal background elements, distinguishing the intention from travel to general character depiction.",

      "question": "Are the characters still wearing travel-appropriate attire, such as jackets and jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Chibi characters are simplified and cartoonish, focusing on facial expressions and small props like books rather than detailed apparel. They are dressed in outfits that are generic and consistent with a Chibi style, which typically involves colorful and playful attire rather than practical travel clothing like jackets and jeans seen in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the characters maintain postures or actions that suggest travel-related activities, such as standing in line or holding luggage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on various reading activities rather than travel-related tasks depicted in Image A. The Chibi characters are involved in actions like reading, smiling, or making facial expressions, none of which directly suggest travel-related actions such as standing in line or managing luggage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the specific types of luggage, such as suitcases and backpacks, still recognizable in their Chibi form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Chibi characters in Image B do not portray any recognizable travel items like suitcases or backpacks. The design concentrates more on the character's facial expressions and simplified body language without including specific objects seen in the original image.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the characters retain enough visual detail in their Chibi form to be recognizable as the same individuals from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi representations in Image B simplify and standardize features significantly. While they might capture a general essence or spirit, specific individual traits from Image A are lost due to the highly stylized and uniform appearance typical of Chibi art, meaning they do not provide enough detail to identify them as the same individuals.",
