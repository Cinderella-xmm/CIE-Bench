      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left parking meter retains its typical cylindrical shape and is colored black, as is the right meter. These are common characteristics of traditional parking meters, aiding their durability and recognizability.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
