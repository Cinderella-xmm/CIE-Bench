      "question": "Is the light blue botanical pattern (leaf and vine motifs) present on the bedding in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly exhibits a pattern on the bedding. Upon inspection, the bedding in the LEGO version shows a vibrant and prominent teal botanical design. The motifs resemble leaves and vines similar to what might be expected from botanical designs, matching the description mentioned. Combining this with the world knowledge of LEGO's ability to duplicate complex patterns suggests the botanical pattern is indeed present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bedding and bed frame rendered in white with light blue accents in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO version of the bed is predominantly white. The bed frame and other elements maintain a white appearance, with noticeable light blue accents visible on the headboard and below the mattress. This observation aligns with the question regarding color and design, presenting white as the primary color with light blue roles as accents, typical of LEGO build for contrast.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly two pillows stacked vertically on the left side of the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bed with three pillows stacked vertically on the left side. When carefully validated, they are distinguishable by their contours and separation lines due to LEGO's structural nature, thereby providing visual confirmation of more than two objects. Hence, the count of objects suggests more than two pillows.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blanket folded and positioned on the right half of the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blanket appears to be spread across the bed with no visible fold indicating it is folded. The design and layout across the bed suggest completeness in its coverage from the middle line extending to the right, confirming it occupies the entire right half of the bed, albeit without perceivable folding.",

      "question": "Is the background a uniform neutral gray with no additional textures or elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO version, the background is plain and uniformly gray, featuring no discernible textures, patterns, or elements that might break this uniformity. This assessment matches the description of an uninvolved and neutral background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show a dark brown rectangular object located in the upper right corner. Its shape and positioning align with the description of such an object, verifying its presence in the corner.",

      "question": "Is the bed positioned horizontally and centered within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bed in Image B is aligned horizontally as evident by its orientation concerning the bed frame's horizontal lines. It appears neatly centered from the left to the right edge within the image borders, maintaining balance in its layout. This alignment corresponds with the description of the bed centered within the frame.",
