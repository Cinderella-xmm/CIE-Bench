      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard maintains its elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stainless steel sink still appears in its traditional oval shape and is positioned in the same general area on the countertop as seen in Image A.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wooden cabinets as retaining their basic structural arrangement and the positioning of the handles, although the appearance is altered to a more stylized, artistic representation with extra patterns.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images B and A show the skateboard leaning against the cabinets, suggesting the same position is maintained. The artistic effects and embellishments in Image B do not alter the fundamental pose or angle of the skateboard in comparison to Image A.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor tiles can be identified by their square shape and pattern, and a wall pattern exists to suggest tiles, even though the color and style of the tiles are artistically altered with vivid colors and new designs. The existence of these patterns indicates retention of the tiled theme.",
