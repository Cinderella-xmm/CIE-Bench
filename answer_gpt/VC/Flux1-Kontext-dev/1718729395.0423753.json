      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden halo is evident above the figure’s head, slightly faint in color but clearly defined against the darker background.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pair of large, extended feathered wings, which are positioned symmetrically behind the figure.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face, including the eyes, is blurred in Image B, making it impossible to discern the color of the eyes. Therefore, based on available visual information, no conclusion can be accurately made about eye color.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s right hand is visible and positioned near the chest area. The hand seems to be resting or clutched around that zone, signifying reverence or prayer, a common gesture found in depictions of divine or holy figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the precise facial angle is obscured, the orientation of the torso and overall posture suggests that the figure is slightly turned toward the viewer, which is a common compositional choice to engage the audience visually in artworks featuring angels.",
