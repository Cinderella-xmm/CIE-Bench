    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the deep, blocky lug pattern of the tire treads?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tire treads are depicted with the same deep, blocky design seen in off-road or all-terrain tires, indicating a tread pattern consistent with rugged tires. This pattern matches the visual design expected for such tires, demonstrating that the edited image has retained the tire treads' characteristic lug pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the embossed text 'ROCKS TIRE' and 'SUPER SWAMPER' visible on the sidewalls of the tires?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sidewalls do not display visible embossed text such as 'ROCKS TIRE' and 'SUPER SWAMPER.' The edited effects around the wheel hubs distract from the visibility of any text on the tire sidewalls. Thus, compared to Image A where embossed text is visible, Image B does not clearly show such details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the five-spoke designs of the wheel hubs still present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheel hubs feature a metallic design, but the detailed five-spoke pattern is obscured by the added illustrations, specifically the blue glowing lines emerging from the center. Compared to Image A, where a clear five-spoke pattern is visible, the edits in Image B alter the clarity and possibly the presence of this design element.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the matte, rubber-textured surface of the tires maintained in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B maintains the matte finish and rubber texture of the tire surfaces that are characteristic of heavy-duty, all-terrain tires. The general visual representation does not indicate a significant change in the texture or finish from the original image to the edited version.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the tread blocks evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original tires?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tread blocks appear to be evenly spaced and proportional, maintaining the consistency expected from a functional tire design. The edited image does not show irregularities or changes in tread patterns compared to Image A, thus preserving the original tire design in the edited version.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the edited image contain exactly four tires, corresponding to the original stack?",
    "explanation": "Image B features four tires, arranged with three at the base and one stacked on top, identical to the arrangement in Image A. The number of tires retains consistency after the edit, confirming that the stack of four tires is present in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
