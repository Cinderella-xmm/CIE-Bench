      "question": "Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acacia trees in the background continue to display their iconic flat-topped shape, which is typical of acacia trees on an African savanna. This silhouette is easily identified through their umbrella-like canopy shape. The spacing between these trees remains similar to what is often seen in natural settings, contributing to a realistic scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tall golden-brown savanna grass throughout the foreground and midground, consistent with what is found in the original environment. The grass maintains its texture and density, depicting a typical savanna landscape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B exhibits a gradient starting with warm orange hues near the horizon transitioning to deeper red and purple tones towards the top. This seamless color transition is characteristic of a sunset environment.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line can be observed where the sky meets the savanna landscape. It maintains a straight separation at about one-third up the image, which is a typical composition in landscape photography.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting suggests a low-angle light source, typical of a sunset, which casts warm highlights on the visible parts of the elephant and the surrounding grass. The shadows, however, show an inconsistency with reality as there are no long shadows behind the subject. Additionally, the edited effect of blue lightning on the elephant might further affect the lighting perception.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is indeed positioned centrally in the frame, aligned vertically, and faces directly towards the viewer. This central positioning provides a strong focal point in the photograph.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The only elements visible in the background of Image B are the acacia trees and grass; there are no water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other wildlife. This presents a clear and undisturbed savanna setting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
