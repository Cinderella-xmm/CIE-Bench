      "question": "Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is depicted within a glass-like dome. The ship features three tall masts, each with multiple sails. The sails are arranged in tiers, which is a common characteristic of historical sailing ships. The edited image maintains this classic structure, indicating that the ship does have three masts with sails arranged in tiers on each mast.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the ship is visually characterized by a traditional sailing ship design with a prominent stern that is raised compared to the rest of the hull. The prow of the ship also appears to curve upward, which aligns with the historical styling of ship hulls. This description matches the visual cues observed in the glass dome settings.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship within the glass dome exhibits three masts, each equipped with several sails. The sails are organized into at least two tiers per mast, typical of traditional multi-masted vessels. This arrangement is maintained when considering the artistic depiction in the dome.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several seagulls are depicted flying around the ship, contributing to a lively maritime scene. By counting, we observe that there are more than five seagulls visible in the illustration. This enhancement in quantity and visibility serves to enrich the setting within the dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the ship's orientation is clearly directed with the bow facing the right side of the image, not the left. The stern is positioned on the left side, indicating the bow is not oriented toward the left as queried.",

      "question": "Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the detailed examination of Image B, no portholes are visibly discernible along the ship's hull as it appears within the dome. The absence of clear porthole details in the artistic rendering suggests this feature is either not present or not emphasized in the edited composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ship encased within a glass dome, giving the impression of floating above the base, reminiscent of a suspended resin layer. This artistic design choice makes the ship appear as if it is hovering above, typical of decorative display models.",
