      "question": "Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no traditional chairs visible. Instead, there are birds, and the environment resembles a mystical forest setting. Analyzing based on common architectural setups, in a typical environment, chairs are commonly arranged to face bookshelves, but Image B diverts from this typical setup. Therefore, there are no chairs positioned in a row.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two pendant lights visible, one is towards the center and another slightly to the right. The visual setup suggests a design that like in common architectural layouts illuminate a seating area, though no clear seating is present.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the floor display a pattern of parallel diagonal shadows cast by sunlight entering from the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground floor is covered with moss and rocks, creating a natural forest floor appearance. The concept of sunlight casting diagonal shadows is more typical in regularly structured settings; however, Image B does not convey such structured light patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large bookshelf structure visible which follows the visual style of a full-height wall of shelves, divided into rectangular compartments, supporting the idea of organized storage or display typical in both natural and magical settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor resembles a natural forest environment with moss and rocks, rather than the sleek design of wooden planks often seen in indoor settings, making the wooden plank composition statement incorrect.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelves have object-like sculptures and some resemble bird figures, not typical decorative objects like a white vase or a blue box that one might expect in a typical interior space dedicated to organization or display of smaller items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette shifts towards earthy greens and browns resembling a forest glade. This divergence from a warm golden-brown palette indicates the design of a forest-like ambiance rather than the warmth mentioned.",
