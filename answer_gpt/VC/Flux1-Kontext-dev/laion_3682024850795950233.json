      "question": "Does the edited image retain the grainy, porous texture of the whole wheat bread slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whole wheat bread slice being part of the characters' heads in the infographic maintains the same visual details as the original Image A. The texture appears grainy and porous, characteristic of whole wheat bread. This analysis is supported by recognizing common characteristics of whole wheat bread and observing that these features have been preserved in the depiction of the sandwich motif in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the green color and leafy shape of the lettuce leaves preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the section representing the sandwich filling still shows the lettuce as a green and leafy component, consistent with how lettuce typically appears. By observing the depicted lettuce in Image B and comparing it with typical representations of lettuce and with the original Image A, it is evident that this quality has been maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, between the bread slices, a red circular shape is visible consistent with the appearance of a tomato slice as commonly represented in sandwiches. Comparing this with Image A, it matches the typical presentation of a tomato slice within the sandwich context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, above the maroon ribbon on the sandwich head character, the word 'AMERICA’S' is visible in a brown serif font, which is also present in Image A. Observing both images shows that this element has been consistently retained, affirming the repeated use and position of this text in the depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a maroon ribbon banner across the center of the sandwich serving as a motif for the character's head and torso. This can be identified as a consistent theme from the original image, where the central placement of a maroon ribbon banner is used similarly for aesthetic presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'SANDWICH' below the maroon ribbon is accompanied by the trademark symbol (™). Comparing with Image A, the inclusion and positioning of this symbol next to 'SANDWICH' is the same, maintaining the trademark marking as part of the design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the Image B, below the ribbon, the text 'SANDWICH™' is shown in a brown serif font. This is parallel to Image A where the same font style and positioning are used. The consistent use of a serif typeface for this term ensures that the design remains the same across both images.",
