    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall bombe (curved, outward-bulging) silhouette of the commode preserved in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO version attempts to imitate the bombe silhouette with brick arrangements that appear to bulge outward slightly in the middle. While not as smooth or pronounced as in finely crafted wood, the LEGO construction gives a visual sense of a curved shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly two drawers stacked vertically on the front of the dresser, each framed by brass mounts?",
    "explanation": "In the LEGO version, the front of the dresser depicts two distinct sections, representing drawers, and they are framed by yellow LEGO elements representing brass mounts, resembling the original design feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the herringbone and starburst marquetry pattern visible on the front of both drawers in the LEGO version?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO version does not display any intricate wood patterns like herringbone or starburst marquetry due to the limitations of the bricks in representing such fine details. The surface appears uniformly brown.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornate brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls present around the edges of both drawers and along the side panels?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO version includes simplified yellow brick patterns meant to mimic intricate brass mounts, but they do not capture detailed designs such as acanthus leaf scrolls due to the medium's limitations. They approximate the style but lack detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the legs curve outward in a cabriole fashion and terminate in brass sabots?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO legs exhibit a slight outward curve to suggest the cabriole style, and they have yellow bricks at the bottom to emulate brass sabots, indicating an effort to represent this element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a scalloped apron below the drawers, following the curve of the bombe shape?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO version includes a lower section beneath the drawers that follows a curved form, suggesting a scalloped apron akin to the design seen in traditional bombe commodes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the top surface rectangular and flush with the upper edge of the dresser body?",
    "explanation": "The top surface of the LEGO version is not entirely flush with the body; it uses different colored bricks that create an edge, rather than a seamless surface, which is necessary for structural integrity in the LEGO form.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) symmetrically arranged on both sides of the dresser?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO version tries to maintain symmetry in element arrangement, such as the yellow LEGO pieces representing brass mounts and the brown color of the dresser body, similar to how designs are typically mirrored on both sides in furniture designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
