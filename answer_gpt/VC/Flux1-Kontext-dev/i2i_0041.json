      "question": "Do the sheep retain their interaction posture (one feeding the others) in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sheep have been replaced by chibi-style characters. These characters are cartoon representations and do not specifically show one feeding the others. They are standing together in a group without displaying any feeding interaction. Therefore, the interaction posture of feeding is not retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the green metal railing still placed in the same relative position near the sheep in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the metal railing, and it appears to be in a similar relative position next to the chibi characters as it was to the sheep in the original image. The perspective and background elements align closely with those of the original, despite the character change.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the snowy ground and background indicative of a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a simplified background that does not explicitly depict snow or a winter environment. It uses a simplified, uniform color tone, likely suggesting a less detailed environment without clear indicators of snow or winter.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the detailed background, including the wooden fences visible in the original image, has been removed or replaced by a simplified design with less detail. Hence, the wooden fences are not visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi characters in the edited image are stylized cartoon versions that retain some sheep-like features such as the fluffy appearance and facial characteristics. Although abstract, they are designed to resemble sheep in a cute, cartoonish fashion.",
