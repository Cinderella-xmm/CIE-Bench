      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "explanation": "Image B depicts bamboo stalks, but they are part of the illustrated background rather than creating a distinct corridor-like formation. The bamboo is drawn more as part of an artistic setting without forming a structured pathway. The portrayal lacks the corridor-like depth seen in real-life images.",
