    "Question": "Q5: Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting suggests a low-angle light source, typical of a sunset, which casts warm highlights on the visible parts of the elephant and the surrounding grass. The shadows, however, show an inconsistency with reality as there are no long shadows behind the subject.
