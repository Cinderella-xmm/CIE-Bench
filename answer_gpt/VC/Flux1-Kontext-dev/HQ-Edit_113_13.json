    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the fox retain its characteristic orange fur on the back and sides, white fur on the chest and muzzle, and black fur on the lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox is depicted as a cartoon character wearing clothing and does not exhibit any realistic fur details. Instead, it has a stylized, simplistic coloration typical of cartoon characters. The focus is more on the character traits like clothing rather than realistic animal features.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the fox’s tail bushy and curled, ending in a clearly visible white tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox’s tail is drawn in a cartoon style, which may not possess the detailed bushy and curly characteristics of a real fox's tail. The emphasis is on simplicity and exaggerated forms typically found in cartoon depictions, lacking a distinct curled shape or detailed white tip.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two monarch butterflies with orange and black wings hovering near the fox’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no butterflies near the fox's head. The image focuses on the cartoon fox character and other anthropomorphic animals. The simplistic art style further diverges from including such real-life details like butterflies.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small white daisies with yellow centers growing in the mossy foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict real-life elements such as daisies typical in a forested background. Instead, it centers on cartoon elements that emphasize the character's interaction with the environment rather than botanical accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ground covered in green moss with visible texture, especially beneath and around the fox?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a bright, simplified landscape typical in cartoons, lacking the finer details like moss texture. The focus is on large, clear areas to direct attention to the characters rather than environmental details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a bright light source behind the trees, creating a glowing effect and casting rays through the forest canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rendered in a cartoon style with bold, flat colors and clear outlines, omitting complex lighting effects such as glowing light sources or rays through a canopy. The scene is brightly lit, but this is typical of cartoon aesthetics rather than suggesting specific lighting dynamics.",
