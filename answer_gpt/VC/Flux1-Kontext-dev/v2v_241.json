      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is visually positioned on top of the elephant's back. The horseâ€™s legs are seen resting on the elephant's body in a balanced manner, which indicates a portrayal consistent with the question of it standing on the elephant's back. Considering common spatial arrangements and the context of the image, the positioning clearly suggests that the horse is depicted standing on the elephant's back.",

      "question": "Is the elephant shown in a posture that supports the horse on its back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the elephant with a posture suitable for supporting an object on its back. The back of the elephant is shown broadly and horizontally, which is how one might expect an elephant to appear if bearing a load. This postural depiction aligns with the notion that the elephant is structured to have the horse atop its back.",

      "question": "Does the background retain a photorealistic appearance with a grassy field and sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a background featuring a grassy field and sky. The field is depicted with a texture resembling grass, and the sky has cloud formations typical of a realistic outdoor scene. The visual cues in Image B suggest a photorealistic interpretation of a natural environment, even though the presence of an ornate frame hints at a less straightforward representation.",

      "question": "Is the spatial relationship between the horse and elephant preserved, with the horse positioned above the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spatial relationship between the horse and the elephant in Image B is preserved with the horse clearly positioned atop the elephant, maintaining the vertical alignment seen in an unusual yet deliberate composition of the horse standing on the elephant's back. The positioning indicates the horse is indeed above the elephant.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a relatively detailed frame encompassing the visual depiction of the horse standing on the elephant. The ornate nature of the frame is evident with design elements typical of decorative photo frames. It suggests a presentation of the scene within a framed setting.",
