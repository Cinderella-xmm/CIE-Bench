    "Question": "Q1: Are the child’s eyes almond-shaped with dark brown irises and a visible light reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area of the eyes is blurred; however, the illustration on the toy box features an exaggerated, cartoon-like representation with dark brown, prominent, almond-shaped eyes, which often includes light reflections for expressive effect.
