      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dress with sleeves that have white lace details and a rounded collar, rather than flared sleeves with a wide collar. These specifics of the dress do not match the description of having flared sleeves and a wide collar.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a dress with a fabric that fits closely and structured, lacking significant vertical folds and draping effects that are typically seen in more loose skirt styles. Thus, no such folds or draping is observed.",
