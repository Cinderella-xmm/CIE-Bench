      "question": "Does the edited image retain the horse's brown coat and dark mane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no horse present. Instead, the image depicts a cartoon-like construction worker character. Hence, it does not retain the horse's brown coat and dark mane from the original context. The absence of any horse or similar animal indicates that the specific attributes of the horse's appearance, such as the brown coat and dark mane, cannot be retained in this context.",

      "question": "Is the horse depicted in a grazing posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a cartoon-character of a construction worker who is standing upright in a static position rather than depicting any animals. Since the image lacks any horse at all, the concept of it being in a grazing posture does not apply.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the sea and grassy shore in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background includes construction-related elements such as cranes and structures, which does not include any elements of a sea or grassy shore. Thus, it does not retain the original natural landscape setting from the first image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image comprises elements related to construction work, such as cranes and industrial structures, and does not feature a white house. Therefore, the image does not include the white house that is visible in the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no presence of a sea or any water body; the background elements are those related to a construction setting. As a result, the characteristic of the sea appearing calm cannot be evaluated or retained in the edited image.",
