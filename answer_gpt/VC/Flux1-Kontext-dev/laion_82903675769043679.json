    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the curved contour of the fairway, leading from the foreground toward the green, preserved in its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful and abstract artistic style alters various elements of the original landscape. The fairway, which in reality would have smooth and consistent contours typical of a golf course, appears more irregular and distorted in the edited image. The artistic presentation emphasizes vibrant colors and forms rather than realistic structure, suggesting that the fairway's original curvature is not maintained.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sand bunkers located in their original positions along the fairway, particularly near the green and on the left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the abstract, stylized representation of the landscape, it is difficult to identify the original forms and positions of the sand bunkers. The artistic rendering changes the shapes into colorful patches, distinct from realistic sand bunkers. Therefore, the sand bunkers are not in their original positions or form.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water hazard present in the foreground, directly bordering the fairway, and reflecting the sky and structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the water hazard should be is depicted in vibrant colors with geometric shapes, rather than showing a realistic water reflection. The abstract representation distracts from what a water hazard actually looks like, thus changing its appearance significantly.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the AT&T GOLF tower and the white event tents located in the right midground, adjacent to the spectator area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the presence and general location of key structures like the AT&T GOLF tower and white event tents, depicted with more emphasis on color and style. Despite the artistic transformation, these features are visually identifiable in their positions near the spectator area.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the green area elevated at the back, forming a slight incline from the fairway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairway and green are depicted with a focus on vivid colors and artistic style that obscures real elevation and contours. The abstract representation doesn't accurately convey the elevation or slope depicted in Image A, changing the perception of elevation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dense group of spectators visible along the edge of the fairway, especially near the green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style transforms the spectators into colorful, blurred shapes that still suggest a dense gathering. While the exact details are not present, the positioning indicates that there is a group of spectators in a manner consistent with a denser congregation, similar to Image A.",
