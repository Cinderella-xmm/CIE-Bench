    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted in a ballet pose with one leg extended vertically upward. The term 'full arabesque' usually refers to having one leg fully extended behind the body, not vertically upward. The right foot is extending downward giving the appearance of both legs being lifted in a kicking motion, which is not consistent with an arabesque. Given these observations, the leg positions do not conform to a full arabesque where one foot would typically be on the ground. Thus, the answer is based on the typical positions in ballet.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both feet of the dancer are shown to have pointe shoes. The color of these shoes is pink and there are visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles, which is consistent with ballet pointe shoes. The ribbons are a common feature for securing the shoes on a dancer's feet.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dancer’s hair styled into a tight, round bun at the top of her head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted with hair that appears gathered and styled into a neat, round bun at the top of her head. This is a typical hairstyle for ballet dancers as it keeps hair out of the face and provides a clean appearance suitable for performances.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the dancer wear a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with white tights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is wearing an outfit that appears to consist of a pink leotard. The leotard is fitted and sleeveless, which aligns with typical ballet attire. The accompanying tights are white, providing contrast and completing the ballet look.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both of the dancer's arms appear to be extended outward rather than one gripping a barre. Given the positioning of the arms, this does not support the description of one arm holding a barre and the other extended outwards. Both arms seem to be in a raised position calligraphically matching many dance poses.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dancer facing to the right side of the image, with her body in a side profile view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's body is in a profile orientation; however, she is facing towards the left side of the image with her body facing slightly towards the front. Thus, her orientation is not consistent with facing to the right.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a visible seam running down the center back of the leotard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the leotard does not show a visible seam running down the center back of the garment. Leotards often have such seams for structural purposes, but in this visual representation, there is no clear indication of one.",
    "answer": "No"
