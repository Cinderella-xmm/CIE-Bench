    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer depicted in an arabesque leap with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted leaping with one arm raised above the head and the other arm stretched to the side, forming a graceful curve rather than a strict diagonal line. The legs are in a split position, without the characteristic arabesque extension behind, indicating that this might not be a traditional arabesque pose. Typically, an arabesque involves one leg extended straight behind the dancer's torso, contrasting with Image B where the legs are split.",
