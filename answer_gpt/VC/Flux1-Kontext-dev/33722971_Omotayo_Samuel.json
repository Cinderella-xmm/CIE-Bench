      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly four suitcases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, it shows three suitcases stacked together: two rectangular suitcases at the bottom and a round suitcase in the middle, with a duffel bag at the top. Utilizing world knowledge about suitcase shapes, it is clear there are only four suitcases present. Recognizing common suitcase types and shapes aids in this conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suitcases stacked in the same order from bottom to top: two rectangular, one round, one duffel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stack with luggage, where two large rectangular suitcases are positioned at the bottom, followed by a round suitcase, and a duffel bag at the top. This stacking order matches the described sequence: two rectangular, one round, one duffel.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the third suitcase from the bottom clearly round in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third suitcase from the bottom is prominently round. The circular shape is obvious and distinct from the other rectangular luggage, confirming its round shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned to the right of the luggage stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual analysis of Image B, the human figure stands directly to the right of the stacked suitcases. Understanding common spatial arrangements allows the determination of the figure's relative placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted in side profile, facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows the figure in a side profile, clearly facing left. Recognizing body orientation allows for accurate interpretation of directional facing, confirming a leftward orientation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the suitcases rest directly on top of one another in a stable vertical stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluation of Image B indicates that the suitcases are stacked directly on top of each other. Despite the whimsical appearance, common physics knowledge allows understanding that this is depicted as a vertically aligned and stable stack.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows only one human figure standing to the right of the luggage stack. A careful examination ensures that only one figure is present, based on common knowledge of human differentiation in a scene.",
