    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the monkey's face and expression clearly visible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monkey's face appears blurred and unclear. Distortion occurs when an image is altered in a way that disrupts its natural appearance. Since blurring affects the clarity and visibility of an image, the monkey's face cannot be considered clearly visible or undistorted in this context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the background still feature a spiral galaxy with stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is analyzed through the visual elements depicting a night sky with a prominent spiral galaxy and several luminous stars. This is consistent with a celestial theme, indicating the retention of a spiral galaxy and starry background.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the monkey's overall posture, including the upward extension of its tail, retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the posture in Image B, the monkey is positioned with an upright body and an upturned tail, just as in typical illustrations of standing primates. This indicates that the original posture and tail position are preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the brass scientific instrument still positioned on the wooden surface near the monkey?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues reveal a detailed representation of a brass scientific instrument closely positioned to the monkey's hand, which reinforces the conclusion that it remains on the wooden surface, just as it was originally placed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Is the wooden surface beneath the brass instrument still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the brass scientific instrument resting atop a visible wooden surface. This observation suggests the continuity of the wooden platform upon which the object is placed, maintaining the original setup.",
