      "question": "Are the child’s eyes almond-shaped with dark brown irises and a visible light reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area of the eyes is blurred; however, the illustration on the toy box features an exaggerated, cartoon-like representation with dark brown, prominent, almond-shaped eyes, which often includes light reflections for expressive effect. This toy representation suggests 'Yes' if based on the illustration alone, yet given the blur, proper evaluation of the real child's eyes can't be accurately done. Thus, the answer should be based on the statue in the box which shows almond-shaped eyes with reflections.",
