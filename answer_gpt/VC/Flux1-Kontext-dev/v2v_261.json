      "question": "Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which shows the edited image, the surfboard is depicted within a snow globe setting. The visible portion of the surfboard has a rounded appearance at the front, suggesting an elongated oval shape, which is a typical characteristic of a surfboard. However, due to the size and positioning of the snow globe, details like a central stringer are not clearly visible or emphasized. Therefore, without specific visual cues of a stringer, the answer can only be based on the shape characteristic visible.",

      "question": "Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image involves a snow globe setting portraying the original surfing scene. The figure's right hand is indeed holding an object that appears to be a small white wax block, which is being applied to the surface of the surfboard. This visual cue is clear because the hand's fingers are positioned around an object consistent in size and shape with a wax block, and this action aligns with common surfboard waxing practices.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, within the snow globe scene, the right hand is positioned accurately holding the wax block, with fingers wrapped around it in a grip-like gesture. The hand is positioned in such a way that it makes direct contact with the surfboard's surface, indicative of the process of applying wax. This is consistent with how one would apply surfboard wax by gripping it directly with fingers.",

      "question": "Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the left hand of the figure positioned flatly on the surfboard, which helps stabilize and support the body while applying wax. The hand appears to rest parallel to the board's surface, which is a typical way to provide support and maintain balance when crouched over a surfboard.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes details of the surfboard surface within the snow globe. The surface appears to have certain granular and textured elements, which are characteristic of the appearance after wax has been applied. Waxing typically results in a textured surface to provide grip, and this granular detail is subtle yet perceptible in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the figure positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning posture with knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image within the snow globe, the figure is represented in a crouched posture, evident from the bent knees and the forward angle of the upper body over the surfboard. This posture is common when engaging in activities like waxing a surfboard, where leaning forward provides better reach and control. The portrayal aligns with typical body mechanics observed during this task.",
