      "question": "Is the white marking on the dog's snout and muzzle clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is placed in a display case as an exhibit, closely resembling a sculpture or taxidermy piece. The display emphasizes the white markings on the snout and muzzle, which contrast strongly against the black fur. The design decision to highlight these parts indicates they are clearly visible. Common knowledge about contrasting colors further supports the visibility of white on darker backgrounds.",

      "question": "Does the dog still have a predominantly black coat with clear contrast against the white markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dog as having a predominantly black coat. The dark fur covers most of its head and back, creating a stark contrast with the white areas on its snout, neck, and part of the chest. Understanding color contrast, black naturally opposes white, making both shades more pronounced than if the coat had a more uniform color design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dog depicted in a relaxed yet alert posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is positioned within a display case, where its posture suggests alertness. The forward-facing gaze with wide-open eyes indicates attentiveness. The relaxed nature is less pronounced due to the presentation as an exhibit, which can often display animals in more neutral, less dynamic poses. However, the posture does not exhibit tension or aggression, suggesting a slight relaxed appearance but mostly alert.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dog's ears positioned naturally in relation to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the dog's ears sticking out to the sides of its head in a way consistent with natural, relaxed positioning typical of its breed. They are neither propped forward nor backward, suggesting the dog is at ease rather than in a heightened state of alertness or defense. This placement aligns with common knowledge about pet ear positions signaling comfort or alertness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog's eyes retain their reflective quality in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's eyes maintain noticeable reflective qualities, as shown through the glistening light reflection spots on the surface of the eyes. This visual cue often indicates both vibrancy and presence of moisture, which is observed in living creatures. The reflective quality helps convey life-like realism and attentiveness, substantiated by understanding how light interacts with moist surfaces.",
