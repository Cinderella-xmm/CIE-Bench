    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing bright red lipstick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the subject's face blurred, preventing an assessment of lipstick color or presence. Thus, based on the visible cues in the image, it is not possible to affirm if the subject is wearing bright red lipstick.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses black with a rectangular frame and reflective lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blur over the subject's face, the shape and color of sunglasses can be seen as black. The edit does not change the frame from rectangular nor introduces reflective lenses; therefore, it suggests they are black and rectangular, but does not specify reflective lenses.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject’s hair pulled back tightly, revealing her forehead and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair appears pulled back, which can be inferred as neatly arranged and possibly tight, though the blur leaves forehead and ears indistinct. As the facial features are obscured, it is difficult to verify complete visibility of forehead and ears.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands visibly gripping the handles of shopping bags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject holding shopping bags in each hand with handles clearly grasped, visible against the background. The editing highlights the visibility of the hands, keeping it consistent with the original pose and action.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a light pink turtleneck visible underneath the coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing under the coat is visible, revealing a light pink turtleneck. Despite the artistic edits surrounding, clothing details remain unchanged from Image A, confirming the identity of the clothing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark gray skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reflects the visible portion of the lower body, showing a dark gray fabric consistent with skirt features beneath the coat. The edit retains much of the original garment details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a strong shadow cast on the right side of the subject’s face and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows varied lighting effects, including shadows on the subject. These are present due to the angle of the light source, visible on the subject’s coat and shopping bags primarily on the right side, indicating a strong shadow cast.",
