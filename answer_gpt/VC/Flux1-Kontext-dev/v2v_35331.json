      "question": "Is the background composed of green grass with visible blades and natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears as a field of green grass. The blades are individually visible, indicating a natural setting. The texture resembles that of real grass. Based on these visual cues combined with common knowledge of what grass looks like, we can conclude it is a grass background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there soft shadows cast by the subject(s) onto the grass, consistent with natural outdoor lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are subtle darker areas on the grass near the base of both the Chihuahua and the banana, suggesting the presence of shadows. This aligns with typical shadow patterns formed by natural outdoor lighting, where shadows are soft and follow the contours of objects.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the fused form positioned directly on the grass surface, with contact points visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Chihuahua and the banana in Image B appear to be standing on the grass, with the dog's paws partially obscuring the grass and the banana resting on the surface. The contact points, such as the base of the banana and the dog's paws, indicate that they are positioned directly on the grass.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the grass predominantly green with natural variations in shade and tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass exhibits a predominantly green color with slight variations in shade and tone, which reflects the natural inconsistency found in real grass due to lighting and differences in blade health.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows a banana with a bright yellow hue and a dog with tan fur, which are the distinct colors of the banana and the Chihuahua. These hues reflect the natural colors of their respective originals, confirming the incorporation in the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground and midground show individual blades of grass contributing to a textured and detailed surface. This adds depth and realism to the scene, consistent with a natural grass environment.",
