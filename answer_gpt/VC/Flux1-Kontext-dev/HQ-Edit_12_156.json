      "question": "Does the structure retain four distinct legs forming a wide base that converge upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues to support the answer include observing the structure closely to identify if four distinct legs form a wide base. The image showcases an edited fantasy-like version of the Eiffel Tower. Despite the alterations, such as vegetation and energy effects, the base structure with four pillars that connect and rise upwards remains visible and intact, indicating that the architectural element of the legs converging upward is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tower’s shape vertically tapered, narrowing progressively from base to spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape of the tower in Image B continues to exhibit a design where it begins with a wide base and gradually narrows towards the top. Despite the presence of additional fantasy-like embellishments, the narrowing aspect is maintained, and the tower's elements draw the eye upward to a thinner spire, consistent with the traditional Eiffel Tower silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible along the tower’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of three distinctive platforms or horizontal levels is typically an architectural feature of the Eiffel Tower. Despite the fantastical enhancements, it is essential to look for platforms indicating where the structure would have these sections in reality. The edited image retains the essence of these levels as discernible areas where the four legs meet and the structure converges, indicating such horizontal breaks along the tower.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tower centrally positioned in the image, aligned with the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B positions the tower in the central part of the frame. This alignment is visually confirmed by assessing the tower's placement relative to the frame's edges and the symmetrical distribution of elements like clouds and pathways around it. The positioning suggests intentional centering around the tower as the image's focal point, enhancing its prominence as the central subject.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground directly toward the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a significant pathway leads the viewer's visual focus towards the base of the tower. This pathway extends symmetrically, indicated by its bilateral semblance and paving stones, reinforcing the editing detail where the path aligns directly with the central axis of the tower, guiding perspective from the foreground into the scene's depth.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source (sun or equivalent) located directly behind the base of the tower, creating a halo effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a prominent light source resembling the sun positioned directly behind the tower’s lower section. This positioning creates a halo or radiant backlight effect, enveloping the tower's silhouette and interacting with its features such as clouds, enhancing the dramatic lighting within the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible cityscape in the background, extending horizontally behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cityscape lightly sketches across the horizon behind the tower, spreading out both to the left and right. This scenic backdrop is subtly situated under the cloud layer and adds depth to the setting, providing context about the tower's metropolitan panorama.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tower significantly taller than all other structures in the image, dominating the vertical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is the most prominent structure regarding vertical space, emphasizing its towering stature over other tangible or implied structures within the visual field. This is depicted by its continued rise above all other elements present, such as the landscape or any other modifications, marking its height dominance.",
