      "question": "Are the four minarets positioned symmetrically—two on the left and two on the right—relative to the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a building or architectural structure with minarets. Instead, it shows a fictional, fantastical creature with wings. There are no architectural elements to analyze in terms of symmetry relative to a central dome as described in the question.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 15 July Martyrs Bridge clearly visible in the background, crossing the water behind the Hagia Sophia?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is dominated by a fantastical creature and a landscape with mountains and a sunset. There is no urban or architectural setting visible, including a bridge or the Hagia Sophia. The focus is on the creature and the natural elements, not on man-made structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a large body of water visible behind the Hagia Sophia, extending toward the horizon with boats on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a surreal environment with a horizon and sunset but does not include any body of water or boats that could be associated with a landscape like the one described with the Hagia Sophia. The emphasis is on the creature and the horizon rather than on any aquatic environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are green trees visible in the foreground, partially obscuring the base of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a fantasy scene with a creature, a sunset, and an open landscape. There are no trees in the foreground obscuring any building since there is no building visible. The foreground features more natural elements aligned with a sunset scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no architectural structure depicted, such as a building with a dome or walls with arched windows. The image focuses entirely on a fantastical creature in an open landscape setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fantastical creature in Image B does not include any architectural components like domes or tiered structures. The image is devoid of any building elements and instead showcases a blend of natural and surreal features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly clear and light blue, indicating daytime conditions without clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a sky with a deep blue gradient, complemented by clouds and a setting sun. This indicates a scene occurring at sunset, not a clear and cloudless daytime sky as described in the question.",
