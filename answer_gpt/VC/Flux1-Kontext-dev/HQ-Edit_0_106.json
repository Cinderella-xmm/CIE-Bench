      "question": "Does the lion’s silhouette retain the distinct, wide, rounded mane shape around its head and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion's mane appears full and rounded, extending broadly around its head and neck. This is visually distinct and typical of a lion’s mane, characterized by a wide spread that frames their face, suggesting a majestic presence. This shape is consistent with the mane's natural grandeur often associated with male lions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lion depicted with its front legs forward and rear legs bent, maintaining a poised, dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lion in Image B is shown with its front legs extending forward, demonstrating an alert and ready posture, while its rear legs are bent, adding to a poised stance indicating readiness and dominance, commonly associated with the way lions naturally display strength and vigilance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lion’s head turned slightly toward the viewer, rather than fully in profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lion's head in Image B is angled slightly towards the viewer. This positioning suggests engagement or awareness, rather than a complete side profile, which would limit the interaction with the viewer's perspective. This head turn aligns with realistic lion portrayals where they are depicted as aware of their surroundings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there grass present in the foreground beneath the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is populated with waving grasses beneath the lion. These grasses contribute to the natural setting, typical of a savanna where lions are often depicted. The presence of grass provides texture and reinforces the wild environment common in outdoor wildlife scenes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains silhouetted acacia trees evident in the background. These trees are iconic of savanna landscapes and are prized for their distinctive flat-topped canopies, making them a recognizable element in wildlife imagery, providing context to the environment the lion is set within.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lion in Image B is centrally placed and dominates the foreground, appearing large in comparison to the background elements like acacia trees. Such positioning emphasizes the lion’s importance and is consistent with compositions that focus on primary subjects to highlight their significance, often seen in nature photography or portraits.",
