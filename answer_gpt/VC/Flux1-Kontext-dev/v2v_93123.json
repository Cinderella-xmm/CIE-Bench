        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man's white hair is visible on the left side of the image, indicating that he retains this feature. Although his mustache is not explicitly blurred, enough context indicates he typically wears one, aligning with his overall appearance. With world knowledge about common elderly features, it's reasonable to conclude he retains both.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of both the elderly man and the pineapple suggests that he continues to face toward the pineapple. This is inferred based on their orientation, which mirrors typical contemplative poses involving such a setting.",
