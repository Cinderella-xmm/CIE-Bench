        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears to be sitting in a chair with an upright posture. The back of the chair is visible and aligned with the subject's back, suggesting support.

    {

      "question": "Are the hands positioned together on the lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are clearly placed together on the lap, holding what seems to be a piece of parchment or paper. This positioning suggests a contemplative or formal pose often seen in portraits.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's head is positioned directly above the torso, which is centered within the frame. This alignment suggests a formal composition that draws focus to the subject, which is typical in traditional portrait photography.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible armrest beneath the subjectâ€™s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrest is visible beneath the subject's right hand, as the subject is seated on an ornate chair with the arm aligned over the armrest. This detail is consistent with the visual cues of a formally staged sitting posture and an environment featuring detailed furniture.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's arms are bent at the elbows and are resting in a manner consistent with having them along the sides, though focused more towards the front since the hands are together holding a parchment. This suggests a traditional seated position where the elbows rest naturally from the shoulders.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the legs positioned symmetrically beneath the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although specific details of the legs are obscured by the robe, the general symmetry of the subject's posture and alignment of the body suggests the legs are positioned symmetrically beneath the torso, as is common in formal sitting poses.",
