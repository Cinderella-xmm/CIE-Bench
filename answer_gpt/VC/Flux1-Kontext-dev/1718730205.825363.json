      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex depicted as a multi-layered spiral structure with concentric rings winding inward toward a central point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a cosmic vortex with a spiral design. Instead of featuring multiple concentric rings, the spiral appears singular with glowing colors and outlined segments. The visual cues emphasize a central swirling pattern resembling one continuous spiral rather than multiple layers. Therefore, based on this visual information, the answer is No.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple trees with rounded, full canopies positioned in the foreground and midground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts several trees throughout the foreground and midground. Each tree showcases a full, rounded canopy. The stylistic choice in the art emphasizes the fullness and roundness of the tree canopies, confirming the presence of multiple such trees within the scene.",

      "question": "Is the cosmic vortex positioned directly above the forest, occupying the upper half of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex is indeed positioned directly above the forest, occupying a significant portion of the upper half of the image. The vortex is central and dominates the sky area just above the trees, corroborating its location directly above the forest landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a calm, reflective body of water in the foreground, mirroring the sky and surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground of Image B illustrates a river or similar body of water; however, the stylized reflection is not explicitly shown as a clear or tranquil mirror of the sky and surroundings. The artistic representation highlights colorful and vibrant features, yet it does not present a realistic reflection. Thus, based on this interpretation, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Are there mountain ranges visible in the background, situated behind the trees and beneath the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there are no visible mountain ranges depicted in the background. Instead, the background consists of stylized waves or hills without distinct mountain characteristics. Multiple layers for depth exist but don't selectively show mountains as part of the landscape behind the trees.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B indeed have foliage prominently colored in hues of pink and rose. The artist's choice to depict these vivid colors adds to the whimsical and fantasy-inspired aesthetic of the illustration, confirming the presence of pink-toned foliage.",
