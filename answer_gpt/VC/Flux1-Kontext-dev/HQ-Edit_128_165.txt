    "Question": "Q1: Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts an ornate jellyfish underwater, lacking any elements related to ceiling beams or architectural constructs typical of a ceiling. In Image A, elements like wooden ceiling beams are prominent. By comparing, it's evident that Image B does not contain the ceiling beams present in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is entirely aquatic, featuring a jellyfish. The environment lacks walls or any construction material, contrasting with Image A, which has a textured stucco wall. Based on world knowledge, water environments don't feature walls like those seen in architectural settings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?",
    "explanation": "While Image A has a lantern casting shadows that form a star-shaped lattice on the ceiling and walls, Image B displays the jellyfish's luminescent pattern without casting shadows onto a ceiling or wall. The nature of constructing shadow patterns from lantern designs does not exist in Image B's setting.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the corner where the white wall meets the wooden ceiling clearly visible, forming a sharp right-angle edge at the upper left portion of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image A has architectural elements like the corner between a wall and ceiling, while Image B, being an aquatic scene, lacks any structural corners or right angles that belong to building interiors. The setting in Image B does not have elements that meet at a right angle as described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the metal chain, consisting of small linked rings, visibly connecting the top of the lantern to the ceiling fixture?",
    "explanation": "Image A shows a lantern hanging from a metal chain with linked rings. However, Image B features a jellyfish in the ocean, with no chain or ceiling fixture presence. The jellyfish exists freely in water without the need for suspension chains.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the light emanate from within the central chamber of the lantern, creating a bright focal point that radiates outward through the perforated panels?",
    "explanation": "Image B's jellyfish emits light from its body, much like bioluminescence, rather than using a lantern structure with a central chamber and perforated panels like in Image A. The light's nature in Image B differs from the described lantern's lighting mechanism.",
    "answer": "No"
