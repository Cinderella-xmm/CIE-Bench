      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted with predominantly dark gray to black fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla depicted appears as a stylized, cartoonish figure that traditionally reflects a gorilla's appearance with predominantly dark gray to black fur, which is typical for these animals. This analysis is based on recognizing the coloring commonly associated with gorilla depictions in popular culture and how this style uses dark hues to represent them.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have dark, almost black skin on its face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoonish version of a gorilla with characteristics suggesting a dark facial hue, mimicking the black skin often found on gorillas. This design choice helps maintain a recognizable aesthetic associated with real gorillas in a simplified form.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gorilla shown with a broad, muscular chest and visible pectoral definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the cartoon style, the figure exhibits an exaggerated and stylized broad chest, characteristic of gorillas. Such depictions accentuate the muscular build even when the pectoral definition is somewhat simplified due to the nature of the toy's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a lighter-colored area on the gorilla’s back and shoulders, indicative of a silverback?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a stylized toy figure, does not display a lighter area on the back and shoulders, which would indicate a silverback trait. The design presents a uniformly colored figure typical of toy designs simplifying real-life features.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a gorilla with cartoon features that imply a broad, flat nose and simplified brow ridges, elements commonly emphasized in gorilla depictions that communicate their distinctive facial structures even in toy form.",
