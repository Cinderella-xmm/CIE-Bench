      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the background composed of vertical wooden planks with patches of peeling red paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows vertical wooden planks with peeling red paint, similar to a weathered surface often found in rustic or aged settings. This is consistent with backgrounds used to invoke a vintage or aged effect by highlighting wear and peeling in conjunction with the wooden texture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floorboards made of rough, aged wood with visible grain and gaps between planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floorboards appear to be rough and aged, displaying visible grain and slight gaps that suggest an older, worn construction typical of antique or rustic flooring.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a red circular reflector attached to the rear fender near the wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited object is a mechanical, steampunk-inspired creation, which lacks typical bicycle components like the red circular reflector attached to the rear fender. Therefore, this specific feature is absent in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wire mesh basket mounted on the front handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a conventional wire mesh basket typically seen on front handlebars of a bicycle. Instead, the handlebars are part of a fantastical, mechanical structure devoid of practical, real-world components such as baskets.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is there a metal luggage rack mounted above the rear wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the concept is drastically different from a typical bicycle with a metal luggage rack due to the creative transformation into a mechanical insect-like model. This alteration means the luggage rack seen in conventional bicycles is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are soft shadows cast by the bicycle onto the wall and floor, indicating directional lighting from the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, depicting a highly detailed mechanical object, includes soft shadows that suggest directional lighting from the left, similar to Image A where shadows provide depth and indicate lighting direction.",
