      "question": "Does the perfume bottle include a shade of pink that matches the \"Rose Pink\" eyeshadow in the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is set against a background that is a soft pink gradient. Without direct reference to the original palette, we can analyze the color in Image B as being in the softer pink spectrum which could resemble the typical 'Rose Pink' hue. Therefore, based on visual cues, the pink shade seems to be present in the background of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle and its adornments are gold and deep red. There is no 'Burnt Orange' color visible as an accent on the bottle itself; the visible accents are gold leaves and cap. Therefore, the accent does not match the 'Burnt Orange' color.",
