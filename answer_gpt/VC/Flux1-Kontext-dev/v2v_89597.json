      "question": "Is the central touchscreen still positioned in the center of the dashboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the touchscreen appears to be centrally placed on the dashboard, consistent with typical car design where major controls are accessible to both the driver and passenger. The depiction through artistic brush strokes does not alter this central positioning. By examining the visual cues in Image A, the touchscreen is indeed centrally positioned, confirming that placement was maintained in Image B despite the artistic effect.",

      "question": "Does the dashboard retain its general structure and placement relative to the steering wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the abstract artistic style, the configuration suggests the dashboard's placement is still relative to the steering wheel. The wood panel & display spans from the left to right, typical in car interiors. In Image A, the dashboard aligns neatly beneath the steering wheel and holds the electronics. Both images suggest the same structural placement, primarily observed in the linear arrangement and steering wheel alignment.",

      "question": "Is the steering wheel still partially visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, while stylized, maintains the recognizable shape and placement of a car steering wheel visible partially on the left side. In Image A, the steering wheel is partially visible in the same region. This indicates the general consistency in steering wheel visibility in both images, confirming its presence.",

      "question": "Does the overall spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior remain consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses artistic brush strokes which mainly affect texture rather than layout. The main components—dashboard, steering wheel, central touchscreen—remain in their familiar positions. This contrasts with Image A, which confirms this interior setup is consistent in structure and placement, displaying similar spatial relations among the elements.",

      "question": "Are the airflow graphics on the screen still discernible, even if represented through calligraphic strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses stylized strokes which maintain the visibility of airflow graphics as artistic renditions. The screen retains the recognizable control elements and graphic flow depiction. Image A shows these graphics clearly, suggesting that despite stylistic variation, Image B's airflow graphics remain discernible as abstract renditions.",
