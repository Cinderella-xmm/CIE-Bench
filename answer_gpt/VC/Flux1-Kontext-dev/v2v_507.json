        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character and various accessories, including the phone, all exhibit a pink color that appears to match the pink hue shown on the phone in Image A. Analyzing these visual cues, the chibi character's clothing, shoes, and depicted phone case suggest an intentional effort to maintain the design consistency with the original phone's color scheme.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character incorporate the dual-camera setup from the original phone in its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The phone pictured in Image B associated with the chibi character includes a dual-camera setup, similar to the phone shown in Image A. By examining the phone design elements, including the characteristic dual-camera placement which is evident in both images, it can be concluded that this feature is retained in the chibi accessory designs.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character's outfit and accessories reflect the sleek and modern design aesthetic of the original phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's outfit and accessories mirror the streamlined, minimalist design often associated with modern tech aesthetics. The use of a monochromatic color scheme, sleek silhouettes along with matching modern gadgets and personal items indicate a design coherence with the aesthetic of the original phone. This is inferred from the shapes, material depiction, and color use that are consistent with contemporary design trends in tech.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chibi character have elongated legs as specified, while maintaining a balance with the phone's design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is designed with a cute, stylized proportion common in chibi art styles. Generally, chibi designs have exaggerated proportions like large heads and shorter limbs, rather than elongated legs. Given this art style, the character's leg design does not reflect the elongated form typically expected and doesn't necessarily align with smartphone design elements, which focus more on sleekness and precision.",

      "question": "Is the solid background color chosen to complement the pink color scheme of the original phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a soft, solid background color that contrasts subtly but complements the pink tones in both the chibi character and the phone. This background choice enhances the overall visual appeal and maintains cohesion with the pink color scheme. The soft background does not detract from the key features, ensuring the focus remains on the pink-themed elements.",
