      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe is depicted with two small, rounded structures on top of its head. These structures are typical of a giraffe's ossicones.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the giraffe with prominent facial features. It has dark eyes and an expression that includes a mouth with a gentle curvature, giving a slightly upturned appearance.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe is contained within packaging, suggesting it is in a sales or display context rather than within a physical room. Its posture is upright, but it is not shown in a room setup. Instead, it's displayed within the packaging design for a toy product, unrelated to being in a room environment. Therefore, considering the visual context provided by the edited image, the answer is No.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the giraffe in a toy packaging, suggesting it is indeed a plush toy. Plush toys typically are characterized by their soft, fuzzy textures, offering tactile appeal, especially for toys aimed at younger audiences. The texture is visually discernible as plush in nature.
