    "Question": "Q1: Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two towers are perfectly symmetrical to the central section of the castle. They are evenly placed on either side, showcasing architectural symmetry typical of castle designs. The symmetry can be seen in their identical shapes and positions relative to the central structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a centrally located arched doorway. However, the door beneath the arch does not appear to be made of wood, but rather the same stylized material used throughout the entire miniaturized model structure. The resemblance to wood is likely due to the color not material.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
    "explanation": "Image B does depict a set of steps leading from the base to the arched entrance, but these steps are part of a solid, flat base rather than ascending from a water level as there is no water present in Image B. The steps in Image B are designed for a tabletop model, not submerged in or leading up from water.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the towers feature multiple vertically aligned rectangular windows, matching the castle-like design with dark frames. This alignment is visible through the consistent placement and identical design across both towers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the towers with flat tops featuring crenellated edges, which are indicative of traditional castle designs intended for battlements. The crenellation can be identified by the repeating pattern of raised and lowered sections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a wall extending from the right side of the castle. However, the wall does not appear to be made of stone as it's stylistically consistent with the model castle's wooden-like appearance. However, its extension horizontally from the right side matches the structural layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
