      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cat with distinct tabby patterns, characterized by darker stripes on lighter fur, visible on its face and body. Tabby patterns are common among cats, typically featuring stripes, dots, or swirls, which are evident on the cat in Image B. The presence of these patterns assists in identifying the cat as having a tabby coat.",

      "question": "Are the cat's eyes still vivid green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are prominently green, which is a common hue for feline eyes. The intensity of the green is clear and vivid, indicating that the color has been preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the cat's belly and chest area still white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat with a distinctly white fur on its belly and chest area. This section of fur contrasts with the tabby patterns on other parts of the body, and this visual cue is common in many domestic cats, whose underbellies are often lighter in color than their backs or sides.",

      "question": "Is the cat still positioned on the wooden surface in a relaxed lying posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is lying calmly on a wooden surface, with its body stretched out and its front paws forward, which indicates a relaxed and comfortable posture. This is a typical resting position for cats, suggesting that the posture remains unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fur texture and lighting effects on the cat and the wooden surface preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a detailed visual representation where the texture of the cat's fur appears soft and realistic, and the lighting creates shadows that enhance the three-dimensionality of both the cat and the surface it lies on. These effects contribute to the overall realistic appearance of the image, indicating that the fur texture and lighting are effectively preserved.",
