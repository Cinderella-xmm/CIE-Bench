      "question": "Is the image composed of two separate panels, with one bird on the left and one on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a setup where one unique bird sculpture-like object is represented in each panel. The left panel has a wooden bird with map engravings, and the right panel depicts a bird made of transparent material, both set in a library environment. This layout strongly suggests that the image is divided into two distinct panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird that was originally on the left still located in the left panel, and the bird that was originally on the right still located in the right panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the left panel has a light-feathered bird, and the right panel has a black and white bird. In Image B, the objects are not real birds but artistic sculptures. The left panel has a wooden bird sculpture with engraved maps, and the right panel features a transparent bird sculpture. This is a complete change from Image A, indicating that the birds from Image A are not preserved in the same positions in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the bird on the left have its head turned toward the viewer, with its beak slightly open and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left panel features a wooden bird sculpture with map engravings instead of a real bird. The head of this wooden bird is not turned towards the viewer but faces slightly to the side without an open beak, contradicting the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird on the right have its body angled such that its back is partially visible and it is facing left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right panel of Image B showcases a transparent bird sculpture with some visual details visible through it. However, the sculpture's orientation reveals a full front view, showing no evidence of the bird facing left or having its back partially visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both panels feature birds placed on raised platforms that resemble wooden pawns. The feet of both sculptural birds rest on these surfaces, and while the sculptures are balanced, there's no clear depiction of the bird feet actively gripping these surfaces. Instead, they just sit upon them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird sculptures in Image B, both in the left and right panels, maintain upright and balanced forms. Each sculpture clearly displays distinct parts: a head, a rounded body, and a tail, adhering to common bird anatomy in a stylized manner.",
