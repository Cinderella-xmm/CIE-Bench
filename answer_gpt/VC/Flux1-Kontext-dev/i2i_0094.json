        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branding 'Niikon' is clearly visible on the camera body. The legibility of the brand name is maintained, although 'Niikon' is used instead of the actual brand name 'Nikon.' The reasoning derives from visual inspection, combined with knowledge that this style alteration is typical in artistic renditions to avoid direct brand replication.",
