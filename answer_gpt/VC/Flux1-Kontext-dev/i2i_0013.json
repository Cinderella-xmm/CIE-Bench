      "question": "Does the edited image retain Einstein’s disheveled white hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is depicted in a stylized manner but maintains the characteristic disheveled appearance associated with Einstein. The hair is rendered with artistic flair, which aligns with the common representation of Einstein's well-known hairstyle.",

      "question": "Does the edited image show Einstein with his tongue out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, without considering the blurred area, the rest of the image does not provide any indication of Einstein's tongue being out. The focus is mostly on the hair and attire. This image seems to focus more on traditional portrayals rather than the playful photograph of Einstein with his tongue out.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even with the blurred region in Image B, the surrounding visual cues like the neck and the size of the head suggest that the face shape and proportions are consistent with typical artistic representations of Einstein.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows part of a suit and tie below the blurred region, which matches the typical depiction of Einstein in formal attire, commonly with a suit and tie.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, aside from the expression which is obscured, the attire and hair style don't particularly point to a playful demeanor, which is most famously characterized by Einstein's picture with his tongue out.",
