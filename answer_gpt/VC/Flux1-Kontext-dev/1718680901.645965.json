    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the creature’s back or head feature a series of upward-pointing, layered spires that mimic the original building’s roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spherical object does not have any spires or features resembling the upward-pointing, layered spires of the building's roofline seen in both images. The creature's back or head, if considering the sphere as the creature, is smooth and spherical without upward-facing spires.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the creature’s body composed of or covered in a golden-hued, metallic material matching the original building’s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spherical object in Image B is covered with a bluish material that has engraved lines resembling a geographical globe, differing from the golden-hued, metallic material of the building’s exterior.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a reflective water surface directly beneath the creature, mirroring its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a reflective water surface that mirrors the spherical object in front of the building, indicating that it acts as a creature. The water's reflective nature captures the object's form quite clearly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the creature exhibit a symmetrical, octagonal or radial body structure consistent with the original building’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spherical object does not exhibit a symmetrical, octagonal, or radial body structure similar to the building's layout. The object is round and does not reflect any octagonal or radial symmetry seen in the building's design.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are arched window-like structures or column-like protrusions visible on the creature’s body, echoing the original building’s features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a globe-like object in front, which lacks arched window-like structures or column-like protrusions. These features are present in the building behind it, but not on the creature itself.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images reveal a setting illuminated with warm, golden-hour lighting. Image B, which has been edited, continues to display soft light and long shadows, which cast a glow over the spherical object and nearby surroundings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has tall trees with leaves that have a warm, autumn-like hue visible in the background, similar to Image A. This suggests the season could be autumn, where leaves display such colors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is a stone platform below the spherical object, consistent with the platform seen beneath the building, and it matches in style and material, indicating that it is similar to the original design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No triangular, transparent, or glass-like panels are visible on the spherical object in Image B, unlike the building which has triangular glass elements. The sphere lacks such detailing.",
