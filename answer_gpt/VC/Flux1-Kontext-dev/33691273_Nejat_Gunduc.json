      "question": "Is the Coca-Cola bottle present in the advertisement with its distinctive curved shape and visible partial logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a section labeled 'Coca-Girls Noir,' which suggests a connection to Coca-Cola imagery. However, there is no advertisement directly featuring a Coca-Cola bottle within the scene. The visual depiction focuses on noir elements without a clear representation of the bottle's distinctive shape or logo.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white earbud visible in the woman’s ear with the wire extending downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top-left frame in Image B shows a woman with a white earbud visible in her ear, and the wire appears to be extending downward. This imagery matches the common depiction of someone using an earbud.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the man and the woman shown in profile, facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several frames show individuals facing different directions in noir settings. The woman in the top-left frame is facing to the right, yet the man further in the frame faces the opposite direction due to the nature of comic-style imagery.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man’s right hand positioned near his ear, holding the earbud in a manner that mimics the woman’s use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement serves more as visual storytelling with apparent influences from noir themes. Although the man appears to be interacting with his ear in a similar fashion, the depiction is artistic rather than literal, with elements obscured in certain frames.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the top-right corner of the advertisement visibly torn or peeling, revealing the underlying surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reflects artistic rendering with noir thematic elements, rather than simple advertisement depiction. The top-right area within the composite image appears intact without peeling or tearing.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man positioned in front of the advertisement, partially overlapping it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a comic-style scene rather than a photograph. In this composition, the imagery is more layered and abstract, with individuals illustrated within frames rather than directly overlapping or interacting with advertisements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the word \"Coca\" or \"Coca-Cola\" legible on the bottle in the advertisement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The words 'Coca-Girls Noir' are present in Image B; however, a specific bottle with the 'Coca' or 'Coca-Cola' logo does not appear visually identified or discernible on a bottle within this artistic setting.",
