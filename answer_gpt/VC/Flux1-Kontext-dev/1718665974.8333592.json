        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, making it impossible to determine the color of the subject's eyes. Based on this, without clear visibility, we cannot confirm the eye color.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hairstyle is visually apparent. The hair appears to be dark and wavy, with two distinctive feather-like adornments, one on each side. This observation aligns with the given description in the question.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the subject features a centrally positioned golden orb on the chest that appears to be intricately designed and glowing. The depiction of emitted light is suggested by the visual brightness around it.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, the alignment of the body, including the shoulders and the positioning of the chest decoration, suggests that the subject is facing forward. However, due to the face being obscured, we cannot definitively determine the expression.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are visibly attached behind the subjectâ€™s shoulders and appear to be symmetrical in their design and positioning. This symmetry is reflected in their evenness and balanced placement relative to the shoulders.",
