      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three distinct arms visible: one central and two lateral arms. They are aligned in a manner that appears symmetrical, as commonly seen in traditional candelabras or lamp holders. This is likely intended for aesthetic balance, confirming the arrangement as symmetrical as per common design standards for such decorative objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a design where both lateral arms are shaped similarly and curve outward symmetrically from the central stem. This symmetry is visually confirmed by parallel positions and mirror-image curves of both arms, which is typical for this kind of item to maintain visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a base that is circular and flared outward. The edge visibly shows ornamental detailing that resembles a beaded or ridged pattern, which is common in these decorative items to add visual appeal and stability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central stem in Image B is indeed a tall, tapering vertical shaft, running from the base all the way to where the arms are attached at the top. This design is functional and typical for providing structural support and aesthetic proportion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms in Image B appear to follow smooth, curved paths from the central stem to the ends, creating an elegant arch which is not only visually pleasing but also traditionally functional for placing candles or light bulbs evenly distanced from the stem.",
