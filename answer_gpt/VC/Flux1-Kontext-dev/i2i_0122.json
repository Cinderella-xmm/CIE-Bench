      "question": "Are the glass cups transparent and maintain their cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cups are clearly visible in a transparent form and maintain a cylindrical shape. This is evident from the way the light passes through the glass and the circular top edges of the cups, which are consistent with the properties of cylindrical glassware. This observation is aligned with the common design of coffee or tea cups that are usually cylindrical to hold liquid efficiently.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the beverage inside the cups retain its brown color and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the liquid inside the cups appears brown, suggesting a typical color for certain beverages like coffee or tea. The surface texture of the liquid appears smooth, which is a common characteristic of these types of hot beverages when freshly brewed. The consistent color and texture indicate that the beverage retains its expected appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the steam visibly rising above the cups in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam is rising from each cup in a manner that suggests movement over time, maintaining a dynamic and natural pattern that is typical of hot liquids. This visual representation is enhanced by the swirling and dispersing effect of the steam, indicating the presence of a hot beverage emitting warmth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cups sit firmly on the wooden surface, showing their shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are positioned on a snowy surface rather than a wooden one. The sun casts a layer of light and shadow that suggests the cups sit firmly, but the surface material - snow instead of wood - means the setting has changed, thus not adhering to the premise of the question regarding the wooden surface. The shadows confirm their stable positioning, but not on wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image retain a warm tone, highlighted by the steam and beverages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting has a cooler ambiance due to the snowy background, which contrasts with the inherent warmth of the steaming beverage. The presence of warm-toned light reflections on the cups, combined with the rising steam, suggests some preservation of warmth in relation to the hot beverage. However, the overall scene displays a mix of contrasting temperaturesâ€”the outside cold versus the internal warmth of the drinks.",
