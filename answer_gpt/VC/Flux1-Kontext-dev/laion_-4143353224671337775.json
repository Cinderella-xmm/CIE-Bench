      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wide open mouth with visible white teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible part of the object reveals no features resembling a mouth with teeth. The edited image shows puzzle pieces that don't convey the presence of a mouth or teeth, unlike Image A which clearly has these features. This suggests that the portion containing the mouth in Image A is obscured by puzzle pieces in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black eyebrows present and positioned above the eye sockets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface features are of interlocking puzzle pieces and lack distinct facial features like eyebrows. Eyebrows are usually positioned above eye sockets, but Image B does not have identifiable brows positioned in such a way, nor visible eye sockets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dark, rounded ears present on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of two dark, rounded elements on each side suggests ears, similar to Image A. These features appear consistent in color and position, implying they are meant to represent ears.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two circular eye sockets visible on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface is designed with puzzle pieces that do not feature eye sockets. Image A had circular features possibly indicating eye sockets, but these are not visible in Image B due to the design's abstraction through puzzle pieces.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a green puzzle piece on the top of the head, matching the color seen on part of Image A's head. This puzzle piece maintains a similar color area placement.",
