      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is the edited image, the zebra is shown with its distinctive black and white stripes clearly visible. These stripes are characteristic of zebras and are maintained across the body of the zebra, covering its legs, torso, and neck. The visual information combined with my world knowledge about zebras allows me to confidently conclude that the stripes are indeed retained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are visible and are positioned upright. This characteristic ear posture is common among zebras, as their ears are often alert and standing up. Based on the visual evidence from the edited image, combined with my understanding of zebra anatomy, the ears are indeed standing upright.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a zebra with a mane on its neck, which is a typical feature of zebras. The mane is short, coarse, and stands upright. Using my world knowledge of zebra morphology, along with the detail provided in the image, it is clear that the mane is visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's tail can be seen, and it ends with a tuft of hair, which is characteristic of zebras. This trait is consistent with the anatomy of zebras where they have a tail featuring a bushy end. From the visuals in Image B, it can be confirmed that the zebra does indeed have a tail with a tuft of hair.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the zebra is shown upright, standing on its legs, which indicates a standing posture. This is evident from the positioning of its legs and the overall body stance. By utilizing common knowledge of typical zebra postures along with the visual information from Image B, it can be determined that the zebra is indeed standing.",
