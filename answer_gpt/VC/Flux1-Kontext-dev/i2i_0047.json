      "question": "Is the train still primarily painted in blue-purple with a yellow front and red doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train retains its blue-purple color scheme with a yellow front and red doors. This conclusion is drawn from observing the color distribution and visual appearance in Image B. These colors match the distinct pattern observed in Image A, suggesting no significant change in the coloring of the train. Hence, the original paint scheme is maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the windows and doors on the train still arranged in their original positions and shapes as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the windows and doors appear to be in similar positions and maintain similar shapes to those in Image A. The observation is based on the alignment and layout along the side of the train, which appear unchanged, suggesting that the window and door positions remain consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the train remain connected to the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train appears to be gliding above the ground with blue lighting effects underneath, creating an impression of futurism or levitation. Image A shows the train firmly placed on the tracks, implying a traditional connection, whereas the edited Image B gives the impression of a futuristic setting where the train is no longer physically connected to tracks.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the train wheels still visible and retain their original structure under the carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train wheels are not distinctly visible; instead, there is an illuminated glow beneath the train suggesting motion or levitation. In comparison, Image A shows a traditional train with visible wheels. The edited futuristic setting in Image B implies a departure from the traditional structure seen in Image A.",

    {

      "question": "Are there any infrastructure elements (like bridges or platforms) surrounding the train in the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features futuristic cityscapes with buildings illuminated by neon lights, whereas Image A shows a train station with visible elements like a platform and an overhead bridge. The edited Image B does not show such infrastructure elements surrounding the train, focusing instead on a cityscape.",
