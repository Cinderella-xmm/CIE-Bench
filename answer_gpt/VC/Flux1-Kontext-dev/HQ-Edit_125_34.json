      "question": "Is the central carved wooden panel with floral and scrollwork detailing behind the desk present and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area behind the desk features a prominently carved wooden panel with intricate floral and scrollwork designs. This detail matches the description given, and there are no signs of alteration or removal when based solely on Image B. Comparing with Image A, this central carved panel also appears consistent and identical in design and structure. The visual cues in both images indicate no changes, thereby suggesting that the panel is present and unaltered.",

      "question": "Are the two large multi-paned windows positioned symmetrically on either side of the desk, with intact glass panes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two large windows with multiple panes positioned symmetrically on either side of the desk. The windows are in good condition with all glass panes intact. When compared with Image A, the window placement and condition appear consistent, confirming that they are both symmetrical and unaltered with intact glass panes.",

      "question": "Are the dark gray drapes tied back at both windows, maintaining their original folds and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are dark gray drapes flanking each window, appearing tied back with folds indicating they are held in place. Observing Image A, the drapes also exhibit the same color, tucking, and position. The drapes appear consistent in both images, thus maintaining their original folds and position.",

      "question": "Is the tufted leather armchair visible on the left side of the frame, partially in view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, there is no visible leather armchair on the left side of the frame. This suggests that the armchair is either not present or not within visible range from the setup in Image B. Referencing Image A, a leather armchair is partially visible on the left side of the frame, indicating its prior presence which is now absent in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the patterned Persian-style rug placed under the desk, extending toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide a visible indication of a patterned Persian-style rug extending toward the foreground under the desk. While Image A has a rug extending prominently toward the viewer, the edited depiction in Image B has altered the perspective or removed the visibility of the rug entirely.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a computer monitor on the desk displaying an earth or globe image, but it is stylized to appear as an older-fashioned CRT monitor instead of the modern flat screen seen in Image A. This suggests that the monitor style has been altered, although its positioning on the desk seems relatively unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible wooden radiator beneath the left window aligned with the baseboard, whereas, in Image A, a radiator sits beneath the same window. This signifies that the radiator is likely not present or visible in the edited image.",
