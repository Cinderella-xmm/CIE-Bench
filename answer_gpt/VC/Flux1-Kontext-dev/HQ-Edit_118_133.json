      "question": "Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a porcelain teapot with a smooth surface and features simple gold floral designs on both the body and lid.

Therefore, the choice is based on the absence of complex patterns as described.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot features a domed lid with a finial at the top, which is typically decorative and can vary in shape but here appears rounded and pointed at the apex. Based on the shape of the lid and the finial design visible, this matches the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot does not have a three-legged base with decorative feet. Instead, it has a circular base that supports its entire structure seamlessly, without any distinct legs or decorative elements. This indicates that a pedestal base with legs is not present.",
