      "question": "Are the industrial structures still positioned on the left side of the image, maintaining their relative arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures remain distinct and are placed prominently on the left side of the image. Despite the artistic modifications giving them a Van Gogh-like texture, their position and structural layout appear to be unchanged. Using world knowledge of spatial relationships and spatial consistency in art edits, we can conclude that their relative positions are maintained.",

      "question": "Does the road still curve gently through the valley, connecting the industrial area to the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road is still visible and curves gently through the valley, similar to Image A. Despite the textured, painterly effect of the edit, the essential elements of the road's trajectory and its role in connecting the industrial area to the rest of the scene remain apparent. Understanding of continuity in geographic elements helps affirm this observation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there still frosted trees visible along the sides of the valley?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees lining the valley still exhibit a frosted appearance, enhanced by the stylized, swirling effect. The visual cue of light-colored tree coverings and the common perceptual attribute of frosted trees provide enough evidence to suggest the presence of frosted trees along the valley's sides.",

    {

      "question": "Are the distant snow-covered peaks still visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the background elements like distant peaks, albeit with a textured, artistic overlay that obscures some details. The mountains remain discernible as they rise in the background, featuring the presence of snow-like features. Knowledge of mountainous landscapes and their depiction through patterns helps in verifying their presence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the industrial structures still retain their general shape and form despite artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures maintain their core shapes and forms, captured through an expressive, modified art style. Observing their silhouette and compositional proportions provides insights into their unchanged structures, though the details are more abstract due to the artistic effects. Understanding artistic abstraction helps affirm this assessment.",
