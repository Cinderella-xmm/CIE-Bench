      "question": "Is the woman’s facial profile, including the shape of her nose, jaw, and eyes, preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B renders the woman in a Lego style, a characteristic form that does not preserve detailed facial features such as the nose, jaw, and eyes that are typically present in realistic depictions. The Lego style uses simplified facial representations, typically with minimal or no specifics of facial contours.",

      "question": "Is the woman’s hair light brown in color and styled in a braid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is depicted in the Lego format, which makes the details like texture and style less discernible compared to realistic images. However, the hair color remains a light brown and appears styled similarly to a braid, based on shape and layout.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt and vest retain their original colors despite the shift to a Lego style. The shirt appears beige, and the vest is olive-green, consistent with what is depicted in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tactical vest retains the straps and buckles that are present in the original vest, even though the Lego styling makes their appearance more simplistic. The essential structure is still intact and visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the woman’s skin tone and facial expression (calm, focused) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s skin tone is rendered in a typical Lego style using a uniformly bright tone. The facial expression is not preserved due to the stylized nature of Lego which minimizes facial details.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the person in Lego form, where eyes are typically depicted as simple dots or small shapes without specific colors like blue-gray.",
