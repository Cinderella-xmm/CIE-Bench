      "question": "Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cover design shows four distinct dragon figures, each occupying a separate quadrant specified by the cross-shaped division. By visual analysis, these dragons follow the traditional illustration style, being individually placed in each quarter section of the cover. With world knowledge about design symmetry, it's typical for such designs to use symbolic creatures like dragons evenly across quadrants for balance and emphasis.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the book cover displays a prominent circular element at the center, which consists of multiple concentric rings filled with detailed inscribed characters. Based on the visual cues, this central element resembles a compass or medallion design often found in decorative arts, likely intended to signify navigation or direction. It is reasonable to conclude the answer considering these visual features and their alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Central to the circular compass design on the book cover in Image B is a star-shaped pointer, visibly prominent and extending outward in a way typical of navigational stars used in compass designs. The representation is coherent with tools for indicating directions, combining traditional imagery and utility.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the book cover in Image B, each dragon is positioned within its quadrant, with appearances suggesting an orientation that aligns with the central point of the compass. Symmetrical placement typically serves the artistic purpose of imbalance and harmony, in line with traditional decorative styles where focal points, like the compass, serve as the center of attention.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons are divided by visible lines intersecting at the center to form a cross shape, effectively dividing the cover into four quadrants. This method of separation is logical within design principles, where spatial division of visual content enhances clarity and organization on symmetric designs like the illustrated book cover.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, the concentric rings in the central compass are inscribed with detailed scripts that visually resemble Chinese characters. This design choice is common in culturally inspired artwork, where authentic scripts contribute to aesthetic and thematic authenticity, indicating such characters may be present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons exhibit features traditionally associated with Chinese dragons such as coiled, serpentine body shapes, heads held high, and claws extended in dynamic poses. This visual representation aligns with classic depictions from Eastern mythology, reflecting the characteristic stylistic elements typical in such art forms.",
