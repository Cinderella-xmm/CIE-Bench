      "question": "Does the image retain the vibrant lime-green color for the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting doll is depicted with a very vibrant lime-green color, similar to the color of the soccer cleat seen in the same image. This is a noticeable characteristic as it stands out against the brown background. This hue is consistent and covers the entirety of the nesting doll.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the textured surface resembling the cleat's material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nesting doll with a smooth surface without any noticeable texture or pattern. In contrast, the cleat features a detailed material texture indicative of its synthetic or leather surface typical of sports footwear.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls incorporate the fuzzy texture and white seam of the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting doll in Image B has a smooth surface without the fuzzy texture or white seam typical of a tennis ball. Tennis balls have a distinct felt-like surface and a stitched seam, neither of which is present on the nesting doll.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the nesting doll with a rounded and wide shape, distinct from the elongated, narrow profile of the cleat. The cleat is designed for a contoured fit around the foot with pointed features, unlike the nesting doll's structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting doll in Image B appears more rounded, similar to a spherical form resembling the overall shape of a tennis ball. Even though it is not a perfect sphere, the smooth, rounded contour brings to mind the characteristics of a ball rather than an elongated shoe.",
