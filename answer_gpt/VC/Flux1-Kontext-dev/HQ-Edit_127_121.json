    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular orb-web is no longer present. The image depicts a fantastical spider-like creature with butterfly wings and a glowing orb, set against a dark, mystical backdrop. This indicates a departure from a realistic depiction of a spider's web, which was evident in Image A with its structured radial and concentric threads.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any branches or webs. The focus is on a single central figure of a spider-like creature in a magical and dark setting. Contrastingly, Image A includes branches and a web, suggesting a more naturalistic context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any leaves, whereas Image A shows branches fitted with various leaves exhibiting an oval form with detail in venation and a glossy surface, naturalistic traits not shared by the fantastical creature in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not contain any leaves, so there are no water droplets as depicted. Image A showed water droplets on the leaves in its naturalistic setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is filled with dark blues and swirling mystical patterns, indicating a magical or surreal setting. This differs from the soft, pale blue-gray sky in Image A, suggesting a significant change in theme and atmosphere.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the webâ€™s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no spider web nor branches, focusing instead on a singular spider-like creature. Image A previously depicted a web connecting to multiple branch points, not present in Image B.",
