      "question": "Is the spiky, multi-tiered golden crown with a central peak and ornamental base present on the elephant’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the multi-tiered crown is present, we examine the ornamental object on the elephant's head. In Image B, the elephant is adorned with a detailed crown characterized by multiple tiers and a central peak, consistent with the description given. By comparing this with general world knowledge about typical royal or ceremonial adornments, it can be confirmed as a crown. Thus, this confirms that the spiky, multi-tiered golden crown with a central peak is indeed present.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is shown with golden bands positioned above each hoof on all four legs, which is consistent with the description provided.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the elephant's trunk is not curled upward in a spiral but appears mostly straight with a gentle curve downward. This representation does not match a distinct spiral shape. Thus, the elephant's trunk is not curled in a spiral shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation, Image B displays the elephant with only the left tusk visible, while the right tusk is obscured or not shown. This illustrates that the right tusk is not protruding and visible, aligning with the query criteria. Therefore, the right tusk is not visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s ears appear to be opened out, but they are not fully extended laterally. They look as though they are naturally positioned, somewhat extended but not in an exaggeratedly lateral fashion that would be described as 'fully fanned out.' Hence, the ears are not completely fanned out to that extent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant exhibits distinct features such as wrinkles on the trunk, around the eyes, and at the joints of its legs. These are typical characteristics associated with elephants due to their thick, textured skin. Observing the visual depiction in Image B, these features are indeed present, confirming the presence of wrinkles.",
