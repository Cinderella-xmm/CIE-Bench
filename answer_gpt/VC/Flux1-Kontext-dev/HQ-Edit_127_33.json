    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the fountain located at the exact center of the garden layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fountain is positioned in the foreground, and the layout features tall topiary and pathways leading into the distance. The fountain appears slightly to the side rather than centrally placed, given its orientation and the visible garden features. Based on the symmetry and alignment, it's not at the exact center.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hedges and flowerbeds form a symmetrical radial pattern centered on the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garden design appears more whimsical with natural curves and free-form shapes rather than strict radial symmetry. The arrangement of plants and structures differs from a typical geometric pattern, indicating an asymmetrical design around the fountain.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an arched gateway at the far end of the central path, aligned with the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a garden with an open view in the distance, featuring more natural landscape elements and without any structural gateway. The absence of solid architectural elements like an arched gateway suggests no alignment with the fountain.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there traditional houses with thatched roofs and chimneys visible beyond the garden wall in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features an expansive, natural landscape with hills and horizon but lacks any human-made structures such as houses or chimneys. This indicates a focus on natural elements rather than architectural features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there pink roses clustered in the immediate foreground, closest to the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground of Image B prominently features clusters of pink roses, creating a vibrant entry into the scene. Their baseline position provides color and texture at the forefront, validating their presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there purple lavender plants arranged in a ring around the base of the fountain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the fountain is accentuated by stones rather than plant arrangements, and there's no visible ring of lavender plants encircling it. The setting leans towards a rocky and aquatic aesthetic instead of floral.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there two tall, cone-shaped topiary trees flanking the entrance to the garden?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features multiple tall, cone-shaped topiary trees throughout, but they do not specifically flank an entrance. The layout is less formal with integrated topiary throughout the scene, not highlighting a specific garden entrance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a visible horizon line separating the sky from the distant landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape stretches into the distance with a distinct horizon line where the earth meets the sky, forming a natural division. This is characteristic of garden design with expansive views.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are pink roses, purple lavender, and red tulips all present in the garden in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garden composition is altered with a primary presence of pink roses and other plant colors, but not specifically matching the original placement of lavender or red tulips. The change in arrangement and plant emphasis suggests a deviation from the original layout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
