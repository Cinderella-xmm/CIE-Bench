        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat on the box has ears depicted in an upright position, which is consistent with typical cat behavior when alert or curious. This matches the visual structure of most cartoon representations of cats, where upright ears often signify attentiveness. The same feature is observed in Image A, where the real cat also has upright ears. Combining world knowledge and the common depiction of cats in cartoon form, it's clear that the representation in Image B maintains the cat's upright ears.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon cat on the box has very large, expressive eyes, characteristic of cartoon art style to display emotions and expressions prominently. In Image A, the real cat has naturally large and expressive eyes, particularly noticeable in the close-up nature of the photograph. Considering how cartoonists often accentuate key features to capture essence and emotion, Image B retains and emphasizes the large expressive eyes of the cat.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur is illustrated flatly without texture, which is common in cartoon depictions due to the style's emphasis on simplicity and expressive features rather than realistic textures. In contrast, Image A shows the cat's sleek fur texture clearly, as seen in the detailed photograph. Therefore, while key features are emphasized in Image B, the sleek fur texture is not realistically represented.",

      "question": "Does the cat maintain its upward gaze and posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon cat on the packaging is facing forward rather than upward, diverging from Image A where the real cat is gazing upward. Cartoons often alter postures slightly to fit designs or convey different emotions, whereas Image A captures a real-life moment of the cat looking up. Therefore, the specific upward gaze and posture seen in Image A is not retained in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon cat's whiskers are prominently displayed on the sides of its face, which is common in cartoon art to emphasize the feline features. This is consistent with Image A, where the cat's whiskers are visible against the light background. Cartoons typically preserve such distinctive animal features for identification, so the whiskers are indeed visible in Image B.",
