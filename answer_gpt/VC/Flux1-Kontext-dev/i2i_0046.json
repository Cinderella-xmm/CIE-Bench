        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is visibly elevated above the ground, indicating he is mid-air. Common knowledge about skateboarding tricks often involves the skater being airborne.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is seen below the skater's feet, elevated yet separate from him and not in contact with any surface, indicating it's in mid-flip. Knowledge of skateboarding tricks like kickflips involves the board appearing in such dynamic positions during execution.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct outlines and structures of buildings and trees.
