        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate the presence of numerous cherry blossom trees with visible pink blossoms, which remain a prominent feature in the scene. Cherry blossoms are easily recognizable by their distinct pink color and the spreading branches seen in the image. Therefore, through visual confirmation, it can be concluded that the cherry blossom trees are indeed present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings showcase traditional Japanese architectural outlines characterized by tiered roofs, intricate wooden structures, and overall symmetry, which are hallmark features of such architecture. Despite any material changes that may have occurred, these outlines remain intact and clearly recognizable. Hence, based on visual analysis in Image B, the answer is affirmative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a straw hat with a red band prominently positioned on a stone pedestal in the foreground. The visual details, including the texture of the straw and the contrasting red band, coincide with the typical appearance of a straw hat. Therefore, based on these visual cues, the hat is indeed placed on the pedestal as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted as bright blue, and cherry blossom petals are visibly scattered across the scene, which is consistent with the depiction of petals drifting in the wind. These visual observations align with the description of a blue sky and petals, confirming the presence of both elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon visual examination, the straw hat in Image B remains on the same stone pedestal, with the viewpoint towards the background buildings unaltered. The positioning relative to the surrounding architecture provides similar spatial context as Image A. Thus, the hat's location in the foreground has not changed in relation to the buildings.",
