      "question": "Is the beige sofa present with its original cushion arrangement?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visual representation of a sofa or any decorative cushions, as the image primarily features a landscape artwork along with textual elements like 'warm living' and 'freedom'.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape artwork features distinct mountain silhouettes and tree outlines, similar to common landscape paintings which often include these elements to depict a serene natural scene.
