        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a character with distinct features resembling a bear, including a prominent snout and ears consistent with a bear's physiology. Bears typically have a short, blunt snout and rounded ears, which are evident in the edited image depiction. The consistent positioning and silhouette are key indicators that these elements have been retained from the original image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear character is dressed in a green Hawaiian shirt with visible orange polka dots, which match the description provided. Additionally, the character wears a straw hat, visually consistent with the expected appearance of such an accessory.

      "question": "Does the edited image retain tropical background elements such as hibiscus flowers and palm fronds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases various versions of the bear character against a plain background without explicit environmental elements like hibiscus flowers or palm fronds. This lack of visible greenery or floral motifs indicates an absence of tropical background elements that may have existed in the original setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the bear character is depicted in six different poses, there is no clear interaction with objects such as a drink or chair. The focus is on the character itself, without external items reinforcing a setting. This suggests that any previous interaction with such objects has not been carried over to the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a vivid color palette, with bright greens for the shirt, warm browns for the bear, and dynamic, cheerful accents like red on cheeks or multicolored flowers. These vibrant colors are consistent with those that would typically be expected in an original setting that conveys a joyful or playful mood.",
