      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central elements include the red book and gold pitcher, displaying rich red and gold coloring. The warm tones and the combination of these colors create a luxurious feel. Drawing from my knowledge, these hues typically invoke warmth and opulence, typical of classic and sophisticated designs. Observing the image provides a clear understanding that the palette is indeed retained.",

      "question": "Is the wooden surface texture and tone preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base on which the book and the pitcher rest has a wooden appearance with a clear grain and rich, natural colors typical of wood surfaces. This indicates the preservation of the wooden surface properties. Wood typically has a textured look with varying shades, and Image B reflects this, confirming that the texture and tone are preserved.",

      "question": "Are the reflective qualities of metallic surfaces retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a pitcher with a glossy sheen that suggests metallic properties. Metals are known for their reflective surfaces, bouncing light off variably based on texture and polish. The image effectively captures these reflective qualities, indicative of a metallic surface, showcasing bright highlights typical of polished metal.",

      "question": "Is the textured appearance of the book cover retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, close inspection reveals the book cover with a visible texture characteristic of certain materials like leather or textured paper. Such materials often appear less uniform and have a subtly tactile visual character. This indicates that the textured appearance of the book is preserved, visible through the surface inconsistencies and detailing.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a gradient transition from deep amber to soft cream tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background with a colour that transitions softly from deeper, richer tones to lighter, softer ones. Typically, gradient backgrounds move smoothly between two colors, providing depth without distinct lines. In comparison to standard definitions, amber tones are richer, transitioning subtly into lighter cream tones. Thus, the gradient described does match these characteristics.",
