    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has a conical shape, but the distinct multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically as seen in Image A are no longer present. Instead, it appears as a singular conical shape with cut-out sections and decorations, implying a simpler or different design approach without the explicit tiering seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of each tier preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets as seen in Image A. The central feature in Image B is more of a smooth surface with embedded nut decorations rather than distinct droplets positioned at each tier.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting each tier preserved in their original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the supporting structures, such as chocolate pinecones, seen in Image A are absent. Instead, the shape is a continuous conical form with openings, without distinct supporting chocolate elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nuts (including almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts) visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does have visible nuts like almonds and pecans, but they're part of the outer surface decorations rather than being contained within teardrop-shaped droplets, which do not exist in this variant.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a circular base is present, but it is more integrated into the overall design, and its presentation is simpler compared to the distinctive wide circular base with a horizontal band seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme dominated by deep brown tones with gold highlights preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a color scheme of deep brown tones similar to Image A. However, Image B features additional gold highlights in the form of decorative elements on the surface, enhancing the festive appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped droplets centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no evidence of teardrop-shaped droplets aligned along its axis as seen in Image A. Thus, these structural elements are not preserved.",
