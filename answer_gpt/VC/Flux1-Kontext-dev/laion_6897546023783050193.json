      "question": "Are both arms extended horizontally to the sides, forming a symmetrical T-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, based on visual cues and world knowledge, both arms of the figure appear to be extended outward, creating what seems to be a symmetrical T-shape. This pose is often associated with iconic statues or depictions of religious figures meant to convey openness or welcoming gestures. The symmetry in arm position can be identified from the equal extension on either side.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the head tilted upward and slightly toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure’s head as slightly angled upwards, which is a standard position in artistic depictions to convey aspiration or contemplation. Despite the blurred face, the angle of the garment around the head and its positioning relative to the body suggest that the head is indeed tilted slightly towards the left side of the frame.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure have a beard and hair covered by a hooded garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the figure is wearing a hooded garment, implied by the draped cloth around the head. The lack of visible hair outside suggests it is covered. The typical representation of such figures includes a beard, reinforcing the interpretation based on the garment style, though not explicitly visible in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands open with palms facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B indicates that the figure's hands are open, with palms facing forward. This is a common gesture in art, symbolizing openness or blessing. The positioning and angle are consistent with this interpretation, and combined with the posture, it reinforces the forward-facing palms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the robe cover the entire body from shoulders to the base of the statue, with vertical folds running down the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe does appear to cover the entire body from the shoulders down, characterized by flowing, vertical folds running along the garment’s length. This is a common design element in illustrations meant to depict grandeur or draping, consistent with religious or monumental art.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the statue shown in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle looking upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pose and viewing angle appear consistent with a frontal display, with the figure gazing forward. The image’s perspective suggests a low angle looking upward, typical of illustrations aiming to convey the grandeur of a statue, emphasizing its imposing nature from below.",
