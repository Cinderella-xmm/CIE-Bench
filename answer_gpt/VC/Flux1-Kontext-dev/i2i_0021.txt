    "Question": "Q1: Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows four chibi sheep characters, each with its own distinctive appearance and accessories. When analyzing chibi-style art, each character is typically independent in its posture and placement. In this image, the sheep characters are placed with space between them, and their position does not imply close interaction with each other. Although two characters are depicted together on the top left, their design appears different from the typical arrangement of an adult interacting closely with two others.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the chibi sheep maintain their original postures, with the adult sheep standing upright and the younger ones leaning towards it?",
    "explanation": "In chibi-style imagery, the characters often exhibit exaggerated or cute features and poses rather than realistic postures. Image B shows individual sheep characters in varying poses—sitting, carrying items, or merely standing—in a manner that emphasizes their cute, stylized nature without displaying a hierarchical relationship typical of realistic depictions where younger ones lean toward an adult.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the chibi sheep retain identifiable sheep-like body proportions, such as a rounded body and small legs?",
    "explanation": "Chibi-style artwork is characterized by simplified and exaggerated proportions, focusing on cuteness and whimsy. Image B illustrates sheep with rounded bodies, small legs, and distinct facial features. These proportions are consistent with stylized drawing techniques used to evoke elements of the subject, even in a simplified format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a visible interaction displayed between the adult chibi sheep and the two younger ones, suggesting care or attention?",
    "explanation": "The chibi sheep characters are independently styled, lacking any explicit interaction in Image B. The designs focus on individual characterization, with no observable actions or postures indicating care or attention between an adult sheep and younger ones, which would typically be seen in actions like leaning, hugging, or shared gazes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the chibi sheep retain a representation of their woolly texture, even in a stylized or simplified manner?",
    "explanation": "Image B reflects the core characteristics of sheep in a simplified chibi style, which includes elements that suggest woolly texture. This is primarily represented through the body proportions and visual cues such as the curly outlines and rounded shapes, conveying a stylized version of fluffy wool.",
    "answer": "Yes"
