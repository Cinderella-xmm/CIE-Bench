    "Question": "Q5: Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
    "explanation": "Contrary to the typical proportionality seen in most real animals, in cartoon renditions like Image B, the head of the squirrel is generally enlarged in comparison to the body to make it cuter and more expressive. The tail is large and bushy, but generally takes creative license over natural proportions. Here, the head is not proportionally smaller than the body, and the tail extends in a manner that doesn't strictly adhere to real-world dimensions.",
    "answer": "No"
