      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a woman dressed in a historical style gown, but the blurred face prevents direct observation of any detail related to eye shape, eyeliner, or lashes. Hence, there is no visual evidence in Image B to confirm the presence of such facial features.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face in the edited image, it's not possible to observe any expressions such as a smile or visible teeth. The blurred area obscures all facial expressions that might indicate a smile.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face in the edited image does not allow for a clear observation of the nose shape or its features. Hence, there is no evidence in Image B to ascertain the specific shape of the nose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a necklace around the woman's neck, but despite it appearing elegant, its specific description in terms of material (silver) or pendant size is not identifiable from the visible cues. There is only general evidence of a necklace.",
