        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jersey features a prominent vertical red 'DALLAS' text on the left side, similar to Image A. This is clear from the visual depiction of the word 'DALLAS' in red, standing out on the jersey design, which matches the style and coloring from Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the left sleeve of the jersey, the tricolor patch consisting of blue, black, and red is evident. It appears as a distinct design element on the sleeve similar to Image A, indicating continuity in the design pattern across both images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible red diagonal stripe running across the torso of the jersey like in Image A. The jersey appears without such a design element, focusing instead on other graphic elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue panel on the jersey clearly shows the placeholder text 'YOUR NAME' in white. This design aspect is consistent with Image A, where the same position and text style is utilized, helping identify and personalize the jersey design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the illustration style, the full-length front zipper is not visibly detailed along the center of the jersey as it would be in a real garment like Image A. The focus is on the artistic depiction rather than exact garment features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the high collar at the neckline of the jersey present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the jersey does not highlight a distinct high collar at the neckline as prominently as seen in Image A. This difference in illustration suggests a simplification in the portrait style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not specifically illustrate the black hem with a white inner lining detail at the bottom of the jersey as seen in Image A, likely due to the artistic representation used in the image which does not focus on such intricate garment details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jersey sleeves are depicted as short and fitting just at the shoulder region of the illustrated cyclist. This mirrors the actual garment style seen in Image A, confirming the uniformity in sleeve design.",
