        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature features a similar color distribution to the dog in Image A, with a predominantly tan face and legs and a black back.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the creature in Image B retains a similar visual mass and proportions as the dog in Image A, the cartoonish exaggeration makes it challenging to definitively attribute specific muscle or body proportions faithfully to the original. The image conveys a similar feel without detailed anatomical accuracy.",
