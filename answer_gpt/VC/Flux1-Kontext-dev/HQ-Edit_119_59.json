      "question": "Is the barbell rod visibly present and gripped by both hands across the lifter's upper back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the barbell rod is visibly present across the lifter's front and he is gripping it with both hands, not across the upper back as described in the question. The positioning is consistent with deadlifting, where the barbell is held in front rather than at the back. Therefore, based on this observation, the correct answer is derived.",
