    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct pyramid shape on the right side in the background. It stands out against the sunset sky, capturing the typical silhouette of a pyramid. The consistency of its geometric form and positioning confirms its presence.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun appears low on the horizon, slightly behind the Sphinx, contributing to the warm glow that spreads throughout the image. It is depicted as a circular form with a radiant effect, indicative of a setting or rising sun.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dense cloud layer below the Sphinx, with the clouds exhibiting warm hues of orange and pink, reflecting the sunset's influence. This not only adds a mystical element but also suggests the low positioning of the sun.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx is oriented toward the right, allowing its profile to be clearly visible. This typical position highlights its distinct ancient Egyptian design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a sky that transitions from a rich orange at the horizon into cooler purple and pink tones higher above. This gradient effect helps to convey depth and the time of day associated with sunsets.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible horizontal erosion lines and layered textures on the lower portion of the Sphinx’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx appears very stylized with smooth surfaces, lacking the realistic weathering patterns or erosion lines typically seen on ancient structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there sand visible around the base of the Sphinx, particularly near the front paws and lower body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Sphinx above a layer of clouds rather than sand, with the clouds obscuring the lower section where the base would meet the ground. This stylization eliminates the desert setting expected at the Sphinx’s base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    }
