      "question": "Is the horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh present on the front of the car and on the robot’s face/torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the car within the packaging has a distinct grille on its front that resembles a horseshoe shape with a central mesh, which is a common design element found on Bugatti cars. The robot's torso also incorporates a similar design feature that matches, suggesting a harmonious design between vehicle and robot form, typical of transformer toys. Thus, combining this observation with the knowledge of design elements in toy versions of cars and robots, the observed grille style on both forms confirms this feature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the side panels, front bumper, and door sections red, and the roof, hood, and lower body black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car in the packaging has noticeable color blocking: the side panels, front bumper, and door sections are in red, while its roof, hood, and lower body are black. This coloration reflects a common style in toy designs where distinct colors highlight different parts of the object for a striking appearance. Examining these regions verifies the specific color combination as described.",

      "question": "Do both the car and robot feature five-spoke silver wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the car positioned in the packaging shows five-spoke silver wheels, visible alongside the robot. Transformer toys often maintain consistent design features across both robot and vehicle forms. The robot also displays wheels with matching spoke designs, reflecting this continuity in design. Observing these aspects in both forms confirms this wheel feature.",

      "question": "Does the robot have gold-colored segmented armor plates on its chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's chest area is highlighted by gold-colored segmented armor plates. This design element stands out as it contrasts with the surrounding black and red color scheme, adding depth and intricacy typical of transformer toys to imply enhanced shielding or detailed mechanical design. The presence and placement of these plates are clearly depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the robot’s arms formed from the car’s doors and fenders, and its legs from the car’s wheels and undercarriage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the transformer robot with arms resembling the car's doors and fenders, visible as they retain similar shapes and colors. The legs, formed from the car’s wheels and undercarriage, represent common transformation aspects where elements of the vehicle integrate into the robotic form. Such continuity in the shared parts aligns with traditional transformer designs observed here.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in front of the robot, with the robot standing upright behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the car and robot are arranged side by side rather than in the front-back formation described in the question. Traditionally, packaging for such toys often places both forms within a single setting to showcase the transforming ability without depicting depth positioning. The distinct separateness and alignment do not match the described configuration.",

      "question": "Are there white stripes on the front bumper and side panels of the car, and on the robot’s shoulders and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, neither the car nor the robot exhibit white stripes on the specified regions. The car and robot mainly showcase a red and black color scheme with the chrome accents but lack these additional stripe features which would typically offer further visual contrast if present. The absence of stripes in these highlighted areas confirms their nonexistence.",
