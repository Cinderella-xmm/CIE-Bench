      "question": "Is the display of the device rectangular with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the device's display has a shape that is rectangular with smoothly rounded corners. This can be seen in the way the edges of the screen are curved and not sharply angular. This design is typical for many modern electronic displays, particularly wearable devices, which opt for rounded corners to enhance aesthetics and ergonomics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital crown is shown on the right side of the watch case, characterized by its distinct circular shape and the highlighted blue ring or LED surrounding it. This placement is a standard design choice for smartwatches, allowing easy access for adjusting settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is a distinct absence of a small button located below the digital crown. Typically, smartwatches would feature such a button for additional functionality, but in this edited image, only the digital crown is present on the right side.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, the watch band is connected to the left and right sides of the watch case, as is typical for wearable devices like smartwatches. The band is attached using a clasp and link style that extends from each side. This design allows for a stable and adjustable fit around the wrist.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the watch at an angle, making it difficult to judge if the screen is perpendicular to the wrist. However, based on the display orientation, it seems angled slightly for better visibility in an illustration. Nonetheless, devices like these are intended to be seen as perpendicular when worn.",
