        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the kitten is shown actively reaching forward, which contrasts with a relaxed posture. However, the dynamic pose gives the illusion of the kitten leaping out, enhancing the depth and 3D effect. Therefore, the posture is actively engaged rather than relaxed.",
