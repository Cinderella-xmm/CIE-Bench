      "question": "Is the brand name \"Karls\" clearly visible on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are cartoon illustrations representing popcorn, pumpkins, and other elements related to pumpkin spice. This indicates that there are no jar labels present, which would typically display a brand name. Therefore, there is no evidence of the brand name 'Karls' visible due to the entirely cartoonish and illustrative nature of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Pumpkin Spice Popcorn\" present on the label of the jar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image is fully illustrative and does not contain labels or actual product imagery. Instead, there is cartoon text 'The Magical Pumpkin Spice Popcorn Journey' prominently displayed. This is not a label typically found on a jar, suggesting there is no text 'Pumpkin Spice Popcorn' on any jar label here.",

      "question": "Is the popcorn contained in a clear glass jar with a silver metal lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a cartoon representation, features cartoon bowls and popcorn characters rather than actual jar imagery. The image focuses on imaginative and playful illustrations rather than realistic objects like glass jars and metal lids.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an illustration of two bowls, which resemble the layout of what might be interpreted as ceramic bowls. However, due to the artistic style, it is not definite they are ceramic or detailed to confirm a blue rim. The image plays more on illustrative storytelling than real-world details.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's content comprises exclusively illustrative elements with cartoon drawings of characters, popped kernels, and pumpkins. No realistic or actual depiction of jars with kernels, popped or unpopped, is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly uses orange tones throughout the illustration, which relates to the autumn theme typical of pumpkin spice products. There are no labels as in Image A, and there is no brown color in the illustration.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a background filled with colorful illustrations and no realistic textures that resemble a wooden surface. The focus is on creating a bright, engaging cartoon scene distinct from realistic settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration includes depictions of scattered popcorn (often with anthropomorphic features like eyes and limbs), but this is part of the artistic and imaginative approach, not scattered physical kernels in a realistic environmental setting.",
