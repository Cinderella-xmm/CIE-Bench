      "question": "Is the portrait of the gentleman contained within an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrait of the gentleman is situated against a plain background with no distinct boundary lines visible that explicitly outline an oval. However, judging by the alignment and constraint of the depicted areas, it implies that the image of the person could be fit within an oval shape, which is evidenced from traditional portrait styles which frequently use such framing. The absence of an overt oval shape does not confirm a circular or rectangular format, suggesting that the representation itself holds contextually equivalent traits to oval portraits.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gentleman depicted in profile, facing toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentlemen is presented predominantly in profile where only the side of the face is visible. The orientation suggests that the figure is presented in right-profile since the visible face is directed towards the right side of the canvas from the viewer’s standpoint. This interpretation relies on standard portrait presentation, where facing right denotes right-profile depiction.",

      "question": "Is there a cravat tied in a bow at the neck of the gentleman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an evident cloth, patterned around the neck of the gentleman which appears to be fashioned into a bow. This form of attire is characteristic of a cravat—a neckband constructed using embellished knots and pleats for formal dress. The visual presentation of a knot and folds, together with the style of historic formal wear, indicate the presence of a cravat tied in a bow at the neck.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the gentleman have dark hair with sideburns extending from the temples to the jawline and a mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman is shown with dark hair that extends downwards near the visible side of the head, implying the presence of sideburns. However, there is no distinct indication of a mustache seen in the portrait; mustache should be in visible proximity, often positioned above a portrayed individual’s upper lip. Since no such feature is represented here, the presence of a mustache is negated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the gentleman wearing a coat that covers his shoulders and upper back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman is illustrated with an outer garment featuring a rich blue coloration and ornate texture covering a substantial region, reaching over the shoulders and extending upwards the back. This is characteristic of a coat or jacket extending across the upper torso, providing coverage over the shoulders and upper back, which aligns with traditional gentleman’s attire.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the nose, jawline, and eye clearly visible on the right side of the gentleman’s face (from viewer’s perspective)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the gentleman is depicted in profile, details such as the eye, nose, and jawline can be discerned from the visible side of the face. The right-side perspective, consistent with this angle, provides adequate visibility to infer the facial bones even without explicit outline prominence. However, specific components such as the eyes are not fully evident, thereby only parts of the facial structure are perceivable.",

      "question": "Is the oval portrait enclosed within a rectangular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include surrounding elements that distinctly indicate a frame, unlike typical portrait presentations that frequently encompass artwork. Without visible boundary structures besides the focal illustration of the gentleman which majorly occupies and presents independently against the canvas expanse, there is no evident frame within the depiction.",
