      "question": "Is the squirrel standing upright on its hind legs with its front paws clasped together near the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is depicted in a cartoonish style rather than a realistic one. It is indeed shown standing upright on its hind legs with its front paws clasped together near the chest, which is a common visual representation of squirrels in animated forms. This posture is simplified for a whimsical or adventurous theme as indicated by the title above.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and outward, extending above the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B has an exaggeratedly large, bushy tail that extends upward and outward, typical of cartoon animals to emphasize certain characteristics like playfulness or cuteness. The tail's curve accentuates its bushiness and is meant to stand out as a defining trait.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ears of the squirrel rounded and positioned on top of the head, with a visible pink inner surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this cartoon depiction, the squirrel has rounded ears that are clearly positioned on top of the head. The design shows a typical large, pink inner surface, which is a common stylistic choice to add character and expressiveness to animated figures. Such accentuated features help convey emotions and are easier for viewers to identify.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, dark, and located symmetrically on either side of the face, with visible pupils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the squirrel with characteristically large, round eyes that occupy a significant portion of the face, making them a focal point. These eyes are placed symmetrically, enhancing the playful and innocent expression typical of animation styles meant for appealing character designs. The pupils are vivid and provide a friendly appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Contrary to the typical proportionality seen in most real animals, in cartoon renditions like Image B, the head of the squirrel is generally enlarged in comparison to the body to make it cuter and more expressive. The tail is large and bushy, but generally takes creative license over natural proportions. Here, the head is not proportionally smaller than the body, and the tail extends in a manner that doesn't strictly adhere to real-world dimensions.",
