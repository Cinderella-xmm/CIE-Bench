    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central floral medallion located on the front center of the body, surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot features a central medallion on the body, but it is not clearly floral, rather it has a label with the text 'Elegance Aroma', thus not fitting the description of a floral medallion surrounded by symmetrical scrollwork.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout extend from the left side of the body with a curled, scroll-like tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a teapot with a spout on the left side; however, the tip of the spout is not evidently curled or resembling a scroll pattern. It's more streamlined and elegant but lacks any obvious scroll-like characteristics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handle on the right side of the body shaped like a C with ornate volute ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle visible in Image B is on the right side and features ornate volute patterns that resemble a C-shape in its flow and ornamentation, confirming its description as shaped like a C with ornate volute ends.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small decorative finial atop the lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lid of the teapot in Image B is topped with a small decorative finial, serving both as an embellishment and functional grip, which fits the description of a finial atop the lid.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there four ornate feet supporting the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a teapot with ornate feet, yet these are not obvious in number as four individual supports since the base is round and the four feet are not distinctly visible as separate entities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the floral and foliate patterns arranged symmetrically around the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B shows symmetry overall, but the visible patterns are largely vertical ridges and text, lacking extensive floral or foliate patterns symmetrically arranged around the body.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the object retain the same overall rounded silhouette with a domed lid and balanced spout and handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B has a rounded silhouette, with a slightly domed lid, and balanced spout and handle. These features convey a sense of symmetry and aesthetic equilibrium consistent with the query.",
