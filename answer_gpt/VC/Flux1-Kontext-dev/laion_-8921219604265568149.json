      "question": "Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left bell tower does not display a clock face in its upper section. The focus here is on the architectural decoration and detailing typical of such towers. Since no indication of a clock is visible, it leads to the conclusion that no clock face is present. In Image A, however, the same section clearly shows a clock face, which confirms the absence in Image B upon comparison.",

      "question": "Are there two bells visible in the arches of the right bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, by visual inspection of the right bell tower, there appears to be only one bell visible in the arches. The placement of the bell in such architectural settings typically involves distinct visibility if multiple bells exist. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn from the visibility of a single bell in the tower structure. In Image A, there is a singular bell as well, supporting the observation in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, a circular stained-glass window with a distinctive pattern resembling a floral or star-like design is indeed present above the main entrance, springing from typical Gothic architectural motifs. This feature is also prominent in Image A, validating its presence in both images.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a cross clearly situated at the highest point of the central roofline, which is consistent with typical religious architecture, signifying its importance. This religious symbol matches the feature observed in Image A as well.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a trio of doors on the façade: a prominent central door flanked by two smaller side doors, an arrangement commonly found in cathedrals and large churches, facilitating versatile entry options. This architectural feature is consistent with the layout in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the façade displays a symmetrical division accented by vertical columns and pilasters. Such structural elements are hallmark components of classical architectural styles, providing balance and grandeur. Comparing with Image A, this symmetry is preserved in both images.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left bell tower in Image B shows a dome with a pinkish hue, topped by a cross, aligning with traditional church tower designs where such domes are both ornamental and symbolic. The same feature is mirrored in Image A, confirming its presence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to the cathedral's right, there is a building with multiple stories, featuring balconies adorned with wrought-iron railings. Such architectural character enriches the urban landscape, offering ornamental and functional aspects. This is consistent with the multi-story structure visible in Image A, reinforcing their architectural continuity.",
