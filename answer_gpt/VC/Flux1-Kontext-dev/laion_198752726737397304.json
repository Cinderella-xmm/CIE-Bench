      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual is dressed in a superhero costume featuring a blue outfit with large yellow daisies and a yellow 'S' logo, which replaces the original attire seen in Image A.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual wears a superhero costume, where the design conceals all accessories including the wristwatch that was visible in Image A.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the third individual in a superhero costume that typically covers the arms and hands, and is without visible rings. In Image A, the ring was visible.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual is wearing a full-sleeved superhero costume, which covers their arms entirely. This contrasts with Image A, where a short-sleeved shirt revealed a tattoo on the forearm. Given the full coverage nature of the costume, the tattoo is not visible.",
