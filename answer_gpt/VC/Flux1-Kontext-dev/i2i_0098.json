      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a white sink on top of a wooden vanity. The sink is oval-shaped and maintains a consistent appearance from Image A to Image B.

      "explanation": "In Image B, a dark-colored vase with red flowers can be seen sitting on the wooden countertop to the side of the sink.
