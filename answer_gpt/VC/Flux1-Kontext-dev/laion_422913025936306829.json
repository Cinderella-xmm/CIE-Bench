      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central figure depicted in a bent-forward pose with one arm raised and the other supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is depicted in a pose that resembles a classical representation of a human form engaged in a dynamic stance. The figure has one arm raised above the head, indicating movement or holding something above. The position of the body, with one knee bent and the other leg extending backward, suggests a pose where the figure is leaning forward and maintaining balance with one arm, as if supporting the body or about to spring forward. These are typical visual cues of a dynamic, active posture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular emblem with wavy internal lines located on the chest of the central figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is an element on the chest of the figure that appears circular in shape and contains wavy lines within it. This resembles an emblem or symbol, commonly seen in artistic representations to convey specific meanings, such as a water-related symbol likely referencing Aquarian themes due to the wavy lines, which are reminiscent of water or waves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central figure enclosed within a diamond-shaped geometric frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall design around the central figure is ornate and filled with various geometric patterns, but the specific outline enclosing the figure does not have a clear diamond shape. Instead, it appears more like an abstract or intricate pattern rather than a simple diamond frame.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a floral motif located in the top-left corner of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the corners of the design feature different motifs. In the top-left corner, there is a pattern that does not distinctly resemble a floral design. Instead, it features celestial and abstract elements, which contrast with the idea of floral motifs that usually have petal-like structures and are clearly plant-based.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there star symbols located near the upper shoulders of the central figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design incorporates celestial elements, and near the upper shoulder area of the central figure, there are small star symbols. These symbols are often used to complement the cosmic or astrological theme present throughout the design. The presence of star motifs contributes to the thematic consistency of celestial elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central figure have long, wavy hair flowing over the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure in Image B is depicted with hair that is lengthy and flows over the shoulders in waves. This is indicated by the lines and curves characterizing the hair design, which are stylized in such a way that they give the impression of flowing, wavy hair, which is consistent with artistic depictions of flowing, dynamic elements such as hair or fabric.",
