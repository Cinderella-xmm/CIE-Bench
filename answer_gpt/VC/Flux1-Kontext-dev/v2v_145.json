      "question": "Does the edited image retain the yellow color and cubed arrangement of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango maintains a bright yellow color and is cut into a distinct cubed arrangement. This structure is commonly used to present mangoes for easy consumption and visual appeal, indicating that the arrangement and color seen are intentional and fit the expectations for a ripe mango. This matches the typical presentation of mango cubes.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green color and sliced appearance of the lime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime retains its green color and is sliced in half, revealing the internal segments typical of a lime, which is commonly used to add flavor or as a garnish. This appearance is standard for a sliced lime, indicating that this feature is preserved, suggesting freshness and readiness for use.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the orange-red color and granular texture of the chili powder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl contains a substance with an orange-red color and a granular texture. These characteristics align with those of typical chili powder, a common spice used for adding flavor and heat to dishes. This consistency in color and texture across images suggests that the chili powder's appearance is maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the mango, lime, and chili powder on the plate mirrors a spatial order that suggests a deliberate placement similar to Image A. The mango is positioned centrally with the lime and chili powder surrounding it, demonstrating an intentional layout for aesthetic and practical presentation on the plate.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wooden texture of the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the plate has a smooth, consistent appearance, which is not explicitly wood-like. The texture appears more polished and uniform, lacking the typical grain and variation associated with natural wood. This suggests a deviation from the original texture visible in Image A.",
