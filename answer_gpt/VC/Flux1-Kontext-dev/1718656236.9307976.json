    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the subject retain the original facial structure, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, although the face area is blurred, the rest of the subject including the headpiece appears to be aligned similarly in both images. However, due to the blurred face, understanding and recognizing specific facial features like eyes, nose, and lips is not possible. Since the facial structure cannot be accurately assessed due to the blur, the question cannot definitively be answered as retaining or changing the facial structure.",

        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows the subject facing forward, the blurred facial area makes it impossible to assess facial expressions or eye contact directly. Thus, determining if the subject maintains a neutral expression with eye contact is unfeasible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that is smooth and neutral, with no visible objects or intricate patterns, characterized by a blurred effect that promotes focus on the subject itself. This is a clearer depiction compared with Image A, where the background appears darker and less blurred.",
