      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a man, as the image primarily features a keychain held in a hand. Thus, there is no visual indication of a man wearing a gray T-shirt and black pants in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain includes an illustration of multiple bananas, but they are part of a cartoon design and not arranged in a pile between a real man and a dog. There is no real pile of bananas between a man and a dog in the keychain depiction.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hand holding a keychain against a neutral background. This can be considered a plain and neutral setup as there are no additional decorations or complex backgrounds. Therefore, the background remains plain and neutral.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chibi-style keychain featuring a German Shepherd with recognizable tan and black markings. The visual cues suggest it is intended to represent a German Shepherd in a stylized form.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no physical man; instead, there is a keychain held in a hand. The bananas are part of the keychain's design. There is no physical placement of a man next to a pile of bananas or a real dog (keychain) nearby. The setup from Image A involving a man and a dog is not represented in this keychain illustration.",
