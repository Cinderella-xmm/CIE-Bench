      "question": "Is the shoji screen window with its grid of wooden frames and translucent paper panels present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we see an image of a product box that doesn't include any architectural features like a shoji screen. The visual content of Image B focuses on a packaged box with design elements and products rather than a room or environment. Given this analysis, the shoji screen window is not present in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the tatami mats with their woven texture and green border lines visible and unaltered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any interior setting resembling tatami mats. Instead, it foregrounds a product box set with thematic elements related to tea. Therefore, the tatami mats are not visible in Image B.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design features of tea-related products are visible, but there is no presence of a tatami floor or scattered maple leaves in autumnal colors. The visual cues indicate a packaged product rather than an interior floor design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual details of Image B focus on product packaging and do not show a warm, diffused golden light typical of a traditional room scene with shoji screens. The lighting in Image B is neutral, typical for product showcasing, with no special effects involving golden light.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a tea tray, shoji screen, or any view of an autumnal setting. The central focus in Image B is a tea product box, meaning the tea tray described is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a tea product and packaging design. There is no background scene visible, especially one that includes a blurred autumn forest through a shoji screen. Image B is clear and focused on the product itself, rather than an expansive background portrayal.",
