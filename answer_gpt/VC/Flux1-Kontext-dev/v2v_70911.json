      "question": "Is the AXE logo still visible on the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the AXE logo is visible on the container. Situated on the side, although the presentation is at an angle, the recognizable AXE text is clear. This leverages brand recognition commonality and visibility of branding on product packaging.",

      "question": "Does the container retain its cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a container at an angle where the cylindrical shape appears somewhat disrupted. The design uses an outward explosion effect, making a portion of the container look broken, thus altering the traditional cylindrical appearance to a more dynamic form.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues from the label's explosive design still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an exaggerated eruption of fiery red and pink hues, strongly resembling explosive energy emanating from the container's side. This leverages color dynamics associated with energy and vibrancy.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net weight text (\"NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g)\") still visible on the label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning and angle only highlight certain parts of the label. The net weight text is obscured by the design changes, primarily due to angle and altered container structure with nebula influences.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the container depicted as mostly intact, with only a crack allowing the nebula to be seen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a significant portion of the container appearing broken beyond a typical crack. It depicts an expansive explosion effect rather than a simple crack, suggesting alteration to the complete structure rather than minor damage.",
