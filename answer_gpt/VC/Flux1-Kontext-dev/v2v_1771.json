      "question": "Is the tower visibly leaning to the right, maintaining its characteristic tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is depicted with a noticeable tilt to the right. Based on common knowledge, the Tower of Pisa is known for its architectural inclination. Therefore, observing the visual cue of the substantial leaning to the right confirms this characteristic tilt.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly eight levels of arched arcades stacked vertically along the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual examination of Image B shows a series of arched arcades along the structure, and these arcades are divided into multiple levels. Counting the arched arcades indicates there are indeed eight levels. This systematic counting reflects the typical architectural feature of the Tower of Pisa.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a red flag mounted on a pole at the very top of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a red flag on a pole is clearly visible at the top of the tower. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge of flags atop historical buildings for decoration or symbolism, asserts the presence of a red flag.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there diamond-shaped decorative patterns embedded in the stonework at the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a section at the bottom of the tower where diamond-shaped patterns are embedded. These patterns are distinctive stonework details commonly seen in such historical architectures known for their intricate designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tower exhibit a white and gray marble texture with visible horizontal bands separating each level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observation of Image B reveals the tower's marble texture that displays both white and gray tones. Additionally, horizontal bands are visible between levels, which are common structural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, reflecting its unique marble composition and design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there slender columns evenly spaced around the perimeter of each level, supporting the arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, slender columns are visibly and evenly spaced around each level's perimeter, supporting the arches above them. This architectural feature is typical of Romanesque architecture, often characterized by classical column use.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tower positioned slightly to the right of the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of Image B shows that while the Tower itself is leaning, the overall structure is located slightly to the right of the center, as the composition of the photograph does not include the tower directly centered but positioned slightly off to the right side.",
