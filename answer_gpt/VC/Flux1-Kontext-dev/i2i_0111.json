        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which depicts the edited setting within a bedroom, the night sky still showcases the swirling vortex texture that is distinctive of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. This swirling pattern is a prominent feature in both the original painting and the edited image, suggesting that the texture has been retained. The swirling patterns are visually consistent with the dynamic motion and energy that Van Gogh is known for, and they are clearly visible in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crescent moon is still prominently positioned in the upper right corner, similar to its placement in many interpretations of Vincent Van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. This placement and the moon’s visibility within the composition align closely with the classic depiction. The light emitted from the moon in a swirling fashion is characteristic of the original style, confirming its retention in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large cypress tree that maintains its elongated shape and is positioned on the left side of the composition, consistent with Van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. This tree serves as a vertical element in the painting and remains unchanged in its form and location. The visual cues confirm that this iconic feature has been preserved intact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the village and the tall church spire appear to be positioned similarly under the night sky as they are in the original artwork. The presence of buildings and the distinctive spire are arranged in a way that suggests retention in the edited image. The placement below the swirling sky maintains coherence with the source painting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in B displays the recognizable thick impasto texture and dynamic brushstrokes that are a hallmark of Van Gogh's artistic style. This is evident in the textured application of paint and the expressive lines that create movement and vitality in the artwork. These elements are crucial to Van Gogh’s work, and their presence in the edited image indicates that this aspect has been faithfully maintained.",
