      "question": "Is the central tower of the fortress composed of multiple stacked, progressively smaller rectangular tiers forming a stepped pyramid shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is depicted as a cake with a distinct architectural feature where the central tower is composed of multiple stacked tiers that decrease in size as they ascend, resembling a stepped pyramid shape. This observation suggests the design element intended in the edible representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there regular, alternating tooth-like projections (crenellations) along the upper edges of the fortress walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fortress walls with clear, evenly spaced crenellations, mimicking traditional fortress architecture. These tooth-like projections are designed to enhance the defensive appearance of the fortress structure in this edible model.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake-like fortress features an easily distinguishable arched opening at the lower front section. This visually serves as the main entrance to the model, aligning with conventional fortress design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a waterfall-like feature originating from beneath the fortress, cascading down the side of the cake-like structure. However, it is stylized in an edible format, simulating the appearance of a waterfall flowing seamlessly into a river-like presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the edibility limits any realistic geological formation, the fortress appears to be sitting on what mockingly represents a raised cliff, overlooking a river-like formation that mimics flowing through a narrow lower space. This aligns with the typical fortress overlooking natural terrain setting, albeit in a simplified, edible manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses colored edible elements to depict greenery surrounding the fortress. These clusters mimic shrubs and trees, strategically placed along the canyon-like formations and riverbanks in a simplified style, retaining the aesthetic of a natural landscape.",
