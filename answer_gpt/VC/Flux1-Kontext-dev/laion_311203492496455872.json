    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a red circular insignia is visible on the left lapel of the suit jacket, similar to many badges or pins worn for decorative or commemorative purposes. This insignia is clearly identifiable due to its distinct color and shape, which stands out against the color of the suit jacket, making it easy to determine its presence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear is prominently visible with vivid coloring and clear outlines. It is located on the left side of the head in the typical anatomical position that one would expect. This visibility helps in tasks such as identifying features or assessing orientation in profiles.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question references the mouth and its state, but without visible cues from the blurred face in Image B, we cannot determine whether the mouth is open or closed, or if a smile is present. However, since the face analysis is excluded, the question about the mouth can't be answered definitively.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the nose retaining its original shape with a distinct bridge and rounded tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As with the previous question, the state of the nose in Image B cannot be analyzed due to the blurred facial features. Therefore, any assertions about the nose's shape or detail would be speculative and not based on the visible content.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the right in a three-quarter profile view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the head suggests a three-quarter profile view, as we can observe more of one side of the face (albeit blurred) and the ear on the left side is fully visible. This is consistent with the visual cues indicating a slight turn of the head.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly off-white with no additional textures or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be uniform with a consistent off-white color, lacking additional textures or objects. This type of background is often used for portraits as it helps focus attention on the subject without distractions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the shadows under the chin and along the jawline soft and consistent with even frontal lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although some parts of the face are blurred, the visible areas such as the shirt and suit do not show noticeable strong shadows suggesting that any shadow under the chin or along the jawline is likely soft, indicating even frontal lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the shirt collar properly aligned and connected to the neck beneath the suit jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt collar is observed to be well-positioned and properly aligned underneath the suit jacket. The collar appears connected to the neck, as expected from a formal attire setup where the shirt is neatly worn with a tie.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
