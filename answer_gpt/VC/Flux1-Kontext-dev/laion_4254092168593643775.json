      "question": "Is the number \"7\" clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the motorcycle shows a rider equipped with a racing suit. The motorcycle has a side panel where the number '7' is visibly printed in white, but the front fender does not visibly show the number '7'. In consideration of what is visible and aesthetically represented, my assessment indicates that the number '7' might exist on another panel based on common racing depictions, but not clearly on the front fender as is depicted in this edited image.",

      "question": "Is the track outline labeled \"5/5\" present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a stylized illustration with the rider, but it lacks photographic elements such as detailed context or textual overlays usually depicting additional information like track outlines or labels. Standard graphical illustrations often display key information through art composition, but this doesn't reflect any labeled track outline like '5/5'.",

      "question": "Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited illustration seen in Image B, there isn't specific dust depicted emanating directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle. Instead, it shows energy or motion lines commonly used in illustrations to indicate speed or activity, which is not physical dust originating from the wheels. By analyzing the art style which doesn't show environmental effects like dust as the original photo might, the motion is indicated abstractly rather than realistically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the rider depicted in a forward-leaning posture with hands gripping the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the rider as leaning forward in a keen posture suitable for motorbike racing with hands firmly grasping the handlebars, which is typical for depicting action and purposeful posture in visual work such as illustrations. The stylization shows an active leaning stance representing typical racing positioning on bikes.",

      "question": "Is the front wheel circular with a blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front wheel of the motorcycle is shown as being circular, which is consistent with typical motorcycle construction. The rim of the wheel is visually painted in blue, demonstrating the artist's choice for accentuating particular elements in the design. The presentation reflects common portrayals of bikes with highlighted features for emphasis.",

      "question": "Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B emphasizes the motorcycle rider set against a bright color background rather than placing them in a realistic setting such as a desert landscape. Within the edited illustration, there is no detailed desert backdrop nor is there any track outline present in the upper-right corner despite the forward placement of the rider for focal emphasis. This abstract representation, common in artistic designs, doesn't reflect real-world environmental context.",
