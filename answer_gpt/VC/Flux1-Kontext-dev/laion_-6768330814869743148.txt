    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show four trays arranged in a 2x2 grid. However, the trays are not wooden but are illustrated with a polka-dot pattern overlay.

    "Question": "Q2: Do the madeleines retain their distinctive shell-shaped form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries labeled 'Madeleine' appear in a tray arranged in a row-like fashion. However, the distinctive shell shape common to madeleines is not visible; instead, the pastries have a muffin-like shape. This suggests a deviation from the typical shell-shaped form, which is usually associated with madeleines. World knowledge about the typical form of madeleines supports this analysis.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the label reading 'Madeleine' positioned near the tray containing shell-shaped pastries?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the 'Madeleine' label positioned near pastries at the bottom-right tray. However, these pastries do not take the shell-shaped form commonly recognized as madeleines but instead resemble muffins. This indicates the label's association with non-shell-shaped pastries, given common knowledge of madeleine forms.",

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the pastries in the bottom-left tray clearly shaped as sliced loaf bread with visible internal texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates pastries in the bottom-left tray where the depiction appears to resemble sliced loaf bread. Given the context of visual cues and typical pastry configurations, the internal texture is not clearly defined due to the artistic style but reasonably suggested through color and form. This aligns with real-world knowledge of loaf bread presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
