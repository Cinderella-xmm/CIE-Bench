      "question": "Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show four trays arranged in a 2x2 grid. However, the trays are not wooden but are illustrated with a polka-dot pattern overlay. Despite the artistic design, the trays are still positioned similar to a real-world tray arrangement, suggesting a 2x2 grid layout. Combining world knowledge about tray arrangements helps confirm this setup.",

      "question": "Do the madeleines retain their distinctive shell-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries labeled 'Madeleine' appear in a tray arranged in a row-like fashion. However, the distinctive shell shape common to madeleines is not visible; instead, the pastries have a muffin-like shape. This suggests a deviation from the typical shell-shaped form, which is usually associated with madeleines. World knowledge about the typical form of madeleines supports this analysis.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the label reading \"Madeleine\" positioned near the tray containing shell-shaped pastries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the 'Madeleine' label positioned near pastries at the bottom-right tray. However, these pastries do not take the shell-shaped form commonly recognized as madeleines but instead resemble muffins. This indicates the label's association with non-shell-shaped pastries, given common knowledge of madeleine forms.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"craster\" visibly engraved on the front of each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the word 'craster' not engraved but creatively displayed in a stylized manner due to the artistic design. The trays feature 'CLASLET,' a modification associated with the artistic interpretation. The absence of a clear engraving further indicates the deviation from traditional wooden tray imagery.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is parchment paper visible inside each of the four trays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a creative depiction shows paper-like elements inside the trays through the use of blue polka dots and stylized figures. These elements simulate the appearance of parchment paper. Considering real-world knowledge of food presentation, such artistic representation indicates the presence of paper inside the trays.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases pastries in the top-right tray that appear with somewhat flattened, oval shapes, mimicking the typical characteristics of certain pastries. Despite the artistic exaggeration, these visual cues reflect the usual form associated with the pastries in such display settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the pastries in the bottom-left tray clearly shaped as sliced loaf bread with visible internal texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates pastries in the bottom-left tray where the depiction appears to resemble sliced loaf bread. Given the context of visual cues and typical pastry configurations, the internal texture is not clearly defined due to the artistic style but reasonably suggested through color and form. This aligns with real-world knowledge of loaf bread presentation.",
