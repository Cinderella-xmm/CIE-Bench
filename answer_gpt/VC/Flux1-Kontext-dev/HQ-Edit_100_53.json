      "question": "Is there a female figure wearing a full-length kimono with a long trailing sleeve and wide hem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female figure is wearing a kimono, which is discernible by its long, flowing fabric and vibrant patterns. The sleeves are visible but do not appear exaggeratedly long, and the hem is wide and trails along the floor extending in a graceful curve, suggesting a full-length design. Common knowledge about traditional kimonos supports the observation of such features being typical for this attire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure positioned with her body angled to the right and her head turned back toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female figure's body is visible but doesn't exhibit a strong angle to the right; rather, she is positioned facing to the right with a slightly turned posture. Her head aligns with her body's direction, indicating no obvious backward head turn toward the viewer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a straight stone-paved path bordered by evenly spaced cylindrical wooden posts on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathway is shown with stone paving, although the stones are stylized and visually simplified compared to Image A. It is flanked on both sides by what appear to be cylindrical posts placed at regular intervals, maintaining the consistent and orderly appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there cherry blossom trees forming an arching canopy overhead with dense pink blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts cherry blossom trees extending above, forming a canopy-like structure with branches arching overhead. The blooms are dense, further creating the appearance of an encompassing arch regular in natural cherry blossom landscapes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there fallen cherry blossom petals scattered along the edges of the path and surrounding grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized illustration does not distinctly show fallen petals scattered along the path or grass edges. The artistic approach may imply their presence through color cues, but visually clear depiction of individual petals is absent.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the pathway as extending straight ahead and the environment subtly suggests a serene continuation into a softly glowing distance beyond, typical of traditional drawings aimed at conveying depth or further journey's end.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a floral ornament, specifically a cluster of pink cherry blossoms and golden details, in the figureâ€™s hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B features an ornament in her hair but without the detailed rendering of pink cherry blossoms and golden elements that were identifiable in Image A. The style affects specificity in such detailed attributes, instead preserved as a general floral adornment.",
