        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting features a depiction of a natural scene with orange-yellow trees along a river, with a sun setting in the background. This conclusion is drawn by observing the color palette dominated by warm orange and yellow hues and the river's reflective surface, suggesting the light of a setting sun. Using world knowledge, this color scheme is typical for sunset imagery in art.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is equipped with cushions that are predominantly beige, matching the overall theme of the sofa fabric.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear indication of natural light illuminating the room coming from the right side, as evidenced by the shadows and highlights on the sofa, floor, and wall. This suggests an unseen window or light source on the right, which is consistent with common architectural designs allowing natural lighting.",
