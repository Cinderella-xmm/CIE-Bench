      "question": "Does the image retain the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo on the front of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grille and logo of the van are visually prominent with the iconic circular Mercedes-Benz logo present. This can be confirmed through familiarity with the brand's design elements, which often include a three-pointed star symbol centered in the grille. The grille's design aligns with what is commonly seen on Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Therefore, the visual cues strongly suggest that the image retains the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo.",

      "question": "Is the overall shape and structure of the van consistent with the original Mercedes-Benz Sprinter design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a van with a recognizable rectangular shape, tall roof, and front-engine layout similar to a typical Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. The basic structural design, including the hood, roofline, and cargo area, matches the standard Sprinter form. Without comparing it to Image A, Image B alone suggests that this is consistent with the expected design of a Sprinter van.",

      "question": "Are the wheels placed in the same positions and maintain similar sizes as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B depict the van's wheels located under the body at positions expected in the vehicle's design, with similar sizes visible. The positioning beneath the front fender and at the rear is typical for a van of this type, and they support the standard load-bearing structure of the vehicle. This analysis aligns with the physical demands for vehicle stability and design.",

      "question": "Does the van still have clean lines and no visible side windows on the cargo area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the van is visually smooth without any visible windows in the cargo area, suggesting it is configured for cargo rather than passenger transport. This observation is consistent with a standard van style used for commercial delivery, where a solid panel design is preferred. The lack of windows aligns with the conventional clean-lined design seen in commercial vans.",

      "question": "Does the van retain the large windshield with the same dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image B maintains a similar large windshield that covers the front cabin area, similar to Image A. The shape and size are consistent with standard design elements necessary for driver visibility and are typical for a van's windshield. Familiarity with automobile design principles further supports this consistency.",
