      "question": "Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a perfume bottle with a rounded top and is labeled 'Winter Glow,' rather than a swan. The neck typical of a swan is not present. The bottle has a symmetrical shape, not an S-shaped curve.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a white snowflake-shaped ornament near the base of the perfume bottle, similar to Image A's placement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the head of the swan-shaped object oriented toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is now a perfume bottle, which does not have a directional orientation like a swan's head. Thus, it lacks an orientation towards the left side.",
