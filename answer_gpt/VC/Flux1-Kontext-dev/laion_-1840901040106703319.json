      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no A-frame roof or triangular windows present. Instead, the image features a structure with a conical glass roof, which deviates significantly from an A-frame design typically characterized by its triangular windows. Considering this information, it is clear that such triangular windows are absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a glass structure with no indication of a cabin, raised deck, or garage. The structure appears to be a glass pavilion with no visible division into upper and lower levels or separation typically seen in a cabin. Therefore, the original structureâ€™s features are not present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no garage door or any indication of a garage structure. The scene is dominated by a glass pavilion, eliminating any features associated with the described cabin, such as a garage door or main entrance arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a symmetrical glass structure, but it is not a cabin with the specific attributes such as a roof peak, entrance, or supporting columns typical of a cabin as described. Given the context and design change, the specific symmetry referred to is irrelevant.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, no vertical support columns can be seen beneath any deck, as the structure has no deck at all. The design focuses on the glass pavilion with no structure resembling a cabin or deck present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no evidence of any window, main entrance, or lower level typical of a cabin structure in Image B. The concept of a small rectangular window by an entrance does not apply to the glass structure visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a flat marble-like surface around the glass structure with no stone retaining wall or boulders. The environment does not include features like stone walls, aligning with the design seen here.",
