      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the flared leg silhouette preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle has a distinct flared leg silhouette reminiscent of the bottom part of bell-bottom jeans. The bottle expands towards the base, similarly to how flared jeans widen below the knee. This indicates that the design maintains the characteristic flared leg shape seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lace-up details present on the outer sides of the lower legs in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features lace-up details along the outer sides of its lower portions, closely resembling the lace-up decoration found on the pants in Image A. This detail is faithfully replicated in the design, indicating that the lace-up element is present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the denim blue color retained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed design uses a bright blue hue, which evokes the color associated with denim. Image A displays a traditional light blue denim color, and while Image B seems slightly different due to its vibrancy and transparency, it remains within the blue spectrum, keeping the essence of denim coloration.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the side profile view maintained in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a direct frontal view of the perfume bottle. On the other hand, Image A provides a side profile view of the jeans. The absence of angled perspective or side view in Image B indicates that the side profile is not maintained in the transformed design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the proportional length and tapering from knee to ankle preserved in the transformed design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perfume bottle in Image B shows a regular and symmetrical flare, lacking the gradual tapering from knee to ankle seen in the actual pair of jeans featured in Image A. The design maintains the overall shape but alters the tapering consistent with traditional bell-bottom jeans.",
