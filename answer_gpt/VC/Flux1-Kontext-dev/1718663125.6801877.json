    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like forehead design with three dots and a central triangle present on the child's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the forehead region does not display any crown-like design or pattern featuring three dots and a central triangle, which would be prominent if present. This absence suggests that no such design has been included in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lace-like borders encircling the eyes clearly visible and symmetrically drawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not exhibit any lace-like borders or adornments around the eye area. The absence of visual elements encircling the eyes supports the conclusion that no lace-like borders are drawn.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth depicted with a stitched, jagged-tooth pattern and vertical lines extending from the nose to the chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image lacks any presence of a stitched, jagged-tooth pattern or vertical lines running from the nose to the chin region. There are no visually evident alterations to the mouth region to suggest this design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically and maintain their original almond shape and direct forward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As the eyes are concealed due to the blurring, fine details regarding shape and gaze cannot be discerned. However, based on the overall symmetry evident in the visible aspects of the image, it can be inferred indirectly that if the eyes were visible, they likely would maintain their symmetry.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the makeup pattern symmetrically aligned across the left and right sides of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face is blurred and does not reveal any makeup-pattern details, determining symmetry based solely on visible cues in the edited image is not feasible. However, the overall symmetrical composition of the garments and hair suggests that symmetry would likely extend to other elements if visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the nose bridge clearly defined and retains its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred area prevents detailed observation of the nose's structure, including the nose bridge. Because the blurring obscures the nose's visible features, confirmation of its definition and position is not possible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the natural lip contours visible beneath the painted teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face area conceals the lip region, meaning the presence or absence of lip contours or any painted teeth cannot be visually distinguished in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    }
