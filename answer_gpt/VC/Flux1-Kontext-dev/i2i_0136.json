      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green stem at the top of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible green stem on top of the orange. This stem is an integral part of the fruit, typically connecting it to the plant, and can often be seen on real oranges. By observing the image, this feature appears prominently on the upper part, helping to conclude that the green stem is indeed retained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glossy texture of the orange still present on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the orange exhibits a shiny, reflective surface that is characteristic of a glossy texture. This is often depicted by the bright highlights and the smooth surface appearance on the orange. The glossiness is clear and evident, suggesting the image successfully retains this texture detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the keychain primarily colored in an orange hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the predominant color of the object, assumed to be the keychain, is a vivid orange. This is apparent from the consistent color shade encompassing the entire fruit, typical of an orange-colored object. The saturation and brightness align with what is expected for an orange, confirming this particular characteristic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surface imperfections and texture patterns of the orange persist on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the surface of the orange displays texture patterns and minor imperfections which are natural traits found on an orange. These details, seen through the variations in light and shadow on the skin, imply a degree of realism that has been maintained in the keychain model.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain a proportional size and shape relative to the plate it rests on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the orange and the plate exhibit a size relationship that seems logical and consistent with familiar common sense understanding of their proportions. The orange fits comfortably within the confines of the plate without appearing too large or too small, aligning with expected size relationships between the two objects.",
