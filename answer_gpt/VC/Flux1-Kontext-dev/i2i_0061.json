        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black cap is visible on the man's head. This is determined by observing the shape and color, which resemble a typical cap. The dark color and head fit suggest it remains a cap, which matches with common headwear visible in similar scenarios.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's body posture suggests that he is balancing as his legs are bent and positioned directly overboard-like surfaces.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's arms are outstretched from his body, a typical posture used for maintaining balance, especially in dynamic activities like skateboarding. This suggests that his arms remain extended to aid in balancing.",
