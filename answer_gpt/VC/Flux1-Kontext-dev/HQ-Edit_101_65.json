    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's facial expression, including a wide smile showing teeth and eyes looking upward to the left, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the facial region is intentionally blurred out, making it impossible to discern any facial expressions or details related to the eyes and mouth. Therefore, we cannot determine the presence of a smile or eye direction based on the visual cues available.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to the left, maintaining the original angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred head position in the edited image indicates that the subject's head is slightly turned to the left, which is consistent with the typical posture of a head slightly turned away from the center. This analysis is possible by observing the shoulder angling and the neck's alignment with the torso, suggesting little to no change in angle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the subject's hands clasped gently in front of the torso, with fingers interlaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the subject in the edited image are gently resting in front of the torso, but the fingers are placed beside each other without interlacing. This conclusion is drawn from the visual observation showing a non-interlaced arrangement of fingers.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the henna designs visible on the subject's palms and fingers preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no visible henna design on the subject's palms or fingers. The analysis of the skin area's visual cues shows plain skin without any intricate patterns that represent henna. Therefore, the henna designs are not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject's natural skin tone and lighting on the face and arms preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skin tone and lighting on the subject's arms in the edited image appear to be natural, with a warm and consistent color tone typical of South Asian heritage, unaffected by lighting glare or abnormal coloration. This assessment is based on examining the arms and visible skin areas, excluding the blurred face.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject's long, wavy brown hair flowing over the shoulders preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the subject's hair as long and flowing over the shoulders, maintaining a wavy appearance typical of the original depiction of such hair. This aligns with the description of the hair's natural fall and texture, confirming it is preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
