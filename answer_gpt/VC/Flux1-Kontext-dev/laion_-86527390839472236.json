    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues indicate the presence of a glass vessel with embossed patterns mimicking seam lines. The knowledge that the transformation involved creating design elements reminiscent of seams suggests these patterns reflect the original item design seen in luggage. World knowledge about design transformations confirms that original patterns are often preserved in modified items.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand logo is clearly visible near the top center of the front face in Image B. Combined with the common practice that logos are prominently displayed in a central and upper area for branding recognition, this placement is consistent and comparable to typical brand strategy.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic spray nozzle in Image B is shown at the top center position, aligned with the vertical axis, which typically reflects the alignment where a handle might exist at the top center in transformation design logic where vertical alignment is preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows decorative caps or elements at the base corners, akin to what would have been wheels' positions in the original image. Recognizing typical design conventions pays homage to original structure elements in transformed pieces, aligning with outer corner positions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible indication of parallel aligned linear elements within the front panel of Image B. Typically, zipper tracks are preserved as marking features but here they are absent, indicating the transformation omitted them.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a handle on the right side, deviating from the original common luggage design that included side handles for functionality. In transformations, functional design elements might be removed, as seen here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
