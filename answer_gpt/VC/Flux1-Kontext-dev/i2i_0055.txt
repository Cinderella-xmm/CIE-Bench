    "Question": "Q1: Is the background still showing the red train and metallic fence?",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the worker still wear the neon yellow vest with orange reflective stripes?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon elephant wearing a yellow T-shirt with an orange vest over it.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the worker still holding the phone up to their ear in the same posture?",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the worker still wearing the yellow hard hat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted wearing an orange safety helmet, suggesting a transformation in style rather than a direct preservation of elements such as a yellow hard hat from the worker’s original wardrobe. The change may be influenced by artistic preference as the hard hat color has transformed to align with the character’s creative portrayal.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the worker’s green shorts and orange pants still visible under the neon yellow vest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower attire is represented as gray elephant legs showing no vibrant differentiation correlating to green shorts and orange pants. This absence demonstrates a shift from detailed clothing elements consistent with real-world uniforms. The design choice is simplified for the cartoon style, where clothing cues common in real-world uniforms are not maintained.",
