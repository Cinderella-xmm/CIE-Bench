      "question": "Is the woman’s face clearly visible with the same eye shape, nose, mouth, and short wavy black hair as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face is blurred out, making it impossible to discern specific facial features such as the eye shape, nose, and mouth, although the hair remains visible. This blur effect obscures details that could confirm if these features match the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe features floral patterns, but instead of rose and vine patterns, they appear to be simpler floral designs. The patterns are different from Image A, where intricate rose and vine patterns were visible.",
