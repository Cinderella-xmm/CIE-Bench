      "question": "Is there a large, circular, reddish celestial body located in the upper left portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large, circular, reddish celestial body in the sky, positioned towards the left side. This appears to be a representation of the moon, characterized by its round shape and distinctive reddish hue, which is typically associated with a 'blood moon' or lunar eclipse. The color and positioning in the sky help identify it as such.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a prominent mountain range with snow-covered peaks spanning the background behind the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a mountain range is visible in the background, featuring peaks that appear to be covered in snow. The details in the image, such as the white tops of the mountains and their towering presence, indicate the depiction of a snow-covered mountain range behind the lake.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, reflective body of water occupying the central foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central foreground is dominated by a large body of water which appears to have a reflective surface. The depiction of the sky and surrounding landscape on the water's surface suggests that this is a lake, taking up a significant portion of the image's foreground.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, clusters of trees with a distinct red color are seen lining both banks of the lake. This is indicative of artistic alterations to the natural color of the trees, possibly intended to enhance the visual impact of the image. These red trees are prominently positioned along the edges of the lake.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake's surface does reflect some of the surrounding landscape, including the snow-capped mountains. While the reflection of the snow-covered peaks is evident, the red moon is not distinctly visible in the reflection due to the artistic style of the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground near the lake’s edge contains visible elements such as rocks and patches that resemble snow. These details are rendered clearly and are part of the natural features lining the lake's shore.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is depicted in the sky above both the mountain range and the lake. Its position high in the sky relative to these other elements of the landscape confirms that it is indeed above them.",
