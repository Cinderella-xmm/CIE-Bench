      "question": "Does the clock tower retain its hexagonal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower maintains a structure that appears six-sided, which is characteristic of a hexagonal shape. The presence of multiple distinct faces surrounding the clock face aligns with a hexagonal geometry. This observation is further supported by the consistent angular architecture seen around the clock tower.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the clock face still present with Roman numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the clock face is indeed present and displays Roman numerals, as evidenced by the distinct markings of I, II, III, etc., around the perimeter of the clock face. Such numerals are commonly used on traditional clock designs, affirming their preservation in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tower still have a balcony with balusters below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible balcony-like structure below the clock face featuring a series of short, evenly spaced vertical posts or balusters. These are commonly found in architectural elements that are referred to as balconies, indicating that this feature remains intact.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tower retain its pointed roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tower having a pointed roof with snow covering it. The pointed shape of the roof is a conical or pyramid-like structure, which remains consistent despite the addition of snow. This suggests that the overall pointed architecture of the roof is preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tower retain its green and yellow color scheme, excluding the flags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From analyzing Image B, the primary color scheme of the tower is predominantly green with hints of yellow on the architectural elements, such as the walls and the borders. This suggests the original color scheme is maintained apart from the flag, which appears white and green instead.",
