      "question": "Does the boy's face retain clear and recognizable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy’s face appears blurred, making it difficult to identify any distinct facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. The blur effect leads the face to lose its clarity and recognition. While assessing Image A, the blur has also obscured facial features, but the focus here is solely based on the clarity seen in Image B.",

      "question": "Are all four original birds present, with the macaw on the shoulder, the cockatoo on the arm, the canary on the head, and the parakeet near the side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, all four birds—macaw, cockatoo, canary, and parakeet—are present and located in their respective positions relative to the boy: macaw on his shoulder, cockatoo on his arm, canary on his head, and parakeet near the side. Image A shows a similar arrangement of birds, confirming that Image B retains the original positioning.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon print on the boy's green T-shirt is visible and seems to feature a design with multiple cartoon characters, possibly from a game or animation. The print is well-maintained and intact without any visible alterations or obstructions. Comparing with Image A also shows that the print remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the boy's head and the birds in a stylized illustration form. The head does indeed appear larger proportionally compared to the birds, which seem shrunken and small relative to the head. In Image A, the proportions are more natural; hence, the illustration in Image B does exhibit this size disparity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a thick white outline surrounding the illustration of the boy and the birds, creating a border effect that differentiates the inner image content from the background. Image A lacks any such outlining, pointing to the edited addition in Image B.",
