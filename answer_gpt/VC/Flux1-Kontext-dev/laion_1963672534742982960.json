      "question": "Are the eyes of the figure still bright blue with clearly visible irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is enclosed within a snow globe. The snow and frosty details obscure some features but generally contribute to a wintry and mystical aesthetic. From the provided description of Image B, the eyes are not visible as they are blurred and this makes it impossible to assess the color or the clarity of the irises. Given this context, it is reasonable to conclude that the eyes are not distinctly visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the facial texture still characterized by deep, horizontal and vertical wrinkles and a cracked, stone-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the change of context by being placed in a snow globe, the visible part of the face still displays the same textured quality that is characterized by deep vertical and horizontal wrinkles, resembling a cracked, stone-like pattern. This indicates that the texture remains consistent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the figure still shown with long, white hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the long, white hair is visible as extending around the face of the figure even within the snow globe. The wintry theme enhances the light hair's appearance, but it does not alter the length or general style of the hair, which still seems to extend past the shoulders.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the figure still have a full, white beard covering the lower face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the snow globe, the figure's lower face can be observed to still have a full beard. The beard is a prominent feature, consistent with the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial contours, including the jawline and cheekbones, still clearly defined and consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement within a snow globe obscures some finer details; however, the prominent features such as jawline and cheekbones are still defined, maintaining their structural integrity. The snow and artistic effects do not fundamentally change these basic facial contours.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the neck still visibly defined and structured, showing a clear transition from head to torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe setting obscures the neck area. The encased presentation and the snow effect make it difficult to observe a clearly defined neck and transition to the torso. As a result, the structural visibility of the neck isn't as evident.",

      "model_answer": "No",
