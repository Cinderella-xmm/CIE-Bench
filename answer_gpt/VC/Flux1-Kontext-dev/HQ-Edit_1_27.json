        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B shows the Eiffel Tower with an intricate iron lattice structure that includes its characteristic crisscross pattern and open framework. This can be identified by observing the detailed design of the tower, which features the intersecting iron beams typical of the Eiffel Tower's architecture.",

      "question": "Is the arched base of the Eiffel Tower visible, with a clear central passage beneath the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the arched base of the Eiffel Tower is visible, as one can see the central passage beneath the structure, which is a common architectural feature of the real Eiffel Tower. This is confirmed by the distinctive arch supporting the tower.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at image B, the spire and crown structure at the top of the Eiffel Tower is present and clearly defined. The spire is a crucial part of the tower's silhouette and is represented accurately in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays rows of lampposts and bare-branched trees that are symmetrically arranged along both sides of the central path leading to the Eiffel Tower. This symmetry is typical in urban planning and enhances the visual balance in the scene.",

      "question": "Are there figures in the foreground positioned facing the Eiffel Tower, with some appearing to take photographs or observe it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, there are several figures positioned in the foreground who are facing the Eiffel Tower. A number of them are depicted as holding cameras or smartphones, suggesting that they are taking photographs or observing the tower, which is a common activity among tourists at such iconic landmarks.",

      "question": "Does the central pathway extend directly toward the Eiffel Tower, creating a strong linear perspective with convergence at the towerâ€™s base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As seen in image B, the central pathway extends directly toward the Eiffel Tower, reinforcing a strong linear perspective that converges at the base of the tower. This visual technique draws the viewer's eyes naturally towards the focal point, which is the tower itself.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
