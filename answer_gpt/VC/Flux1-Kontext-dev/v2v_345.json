      "question": "Is the USB-C port located centrally on the bottom edge of the smartphone, flanked by two sets of three circular speaker holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone's bottom edge shows a USB-C port situated centrally. On either side of this port are two symmetrical sets of three circular holes, which are typically used for speakers. The design is consistent with common smartphone configurations. Hence, the answer is determined by the visible layout of the ports and holes.",

      "question": "Is the smartphone placed diagonally on the wooden surface, with its bottom edge closer to the viewer than the top edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone's alignment is parallel to the wooden surface's grain. The entire bottom edge is closer to the viewer and the phone is not tilted diagonally. This observation is based on the perspective and orientation visible in the image.",

      "question": "Does the wooden surface display a consistent horizontal grain pattern with warm brown tones and visible wood fibers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden surface exhibits a uniform horizontal grain pattern. The tones are warm and brown, commonly associated with polished or varnished wood. The grain and fibers are distinguishable, signifying this characteristic. The opinion is derived from observing the texture and color consistency in the image.",

      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color with a soft blur effect, providing a shallow depth of field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly beige with no discernible texture or pattern. It shows a consistent smoothness and lack of focus which suggests a shallow depth of field. This creates an undistracting backdrop, allowing the main subjects to stand out clearly.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pixelated mouse is clearly positioned on the left side of the smartphone, both on the same wooden surface. The image firmly places both objects in close proximity, consistent with the stated positioning.",
