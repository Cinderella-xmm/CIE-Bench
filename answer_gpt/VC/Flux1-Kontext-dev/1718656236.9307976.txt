    "Question": "Q1: Does the subject retain the original facial structure, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, although the face area is blurred, the rest of the subject including the headpiece appears to be aligned similarly in both images. However, due to the blurred face, understanding and recognizing specific facial features like eyes, nose, and lips is not possible. Since the facial structure cannot be accurately assessed due to the blur, the question cannot definitively be answered as retaining or changing the facial structure.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the subject facing directly forward with a neutral expression, maintaining eye contact with the viewer?",
