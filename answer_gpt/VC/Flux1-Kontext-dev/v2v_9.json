        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted with a predominantly purple color scheme for its 'body', which mimics the original purple bubble tea shown in Image A. The straw, cup, and tapioca pearls in both images are purple, which suggests a deliberate use of this color palette to maintain consistency with the original bubble tea.",

      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a glossy finish, especially noticeable on the dome shaped head and the straw, replicating the shiny surface seen in the dome lid and sides of the bubble tea cup from Image A. This consistency in texture highlights the artistic choice to maintain the bubble tea's visual aesthetic.",
