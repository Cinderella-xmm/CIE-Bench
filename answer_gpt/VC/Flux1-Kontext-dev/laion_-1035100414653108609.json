      "question": "Is the text \"NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C.\" present at the top center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a warthog with a vibrant and fantastical depiction in a lush forest setting. Analyzing visual cues, the vibrancy of the scene and the absence of any textual elements across the top of Image B suggest that the background is purely graphical, without any overlaying text.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"WART HOG\" present at the bottom center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, it contains a stylized depiction of a warthog amidst green foliage and trees. There is no textual content at the bottom center of the image, reinforcing the idea that this image focuses on artistic expression rather than documentation, thus no 'WART HOG' text is present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ground beneath the warthog covered with dry, pale yellow straw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the warthog standing on a ground covered in vibrant green plant life and rich forest soil; there is no straw present beneath the warthog. The natural and lush environment depicted extends visually across the image with green hues and forest elements, absent of straw.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background behind the warthog a dark green-brown gradient, resembling an indoor or shaded enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a lush, open forest environment with distinct trees and leaves visible. While it features a gradient of colors, including various greens, it more closely resembles a vibrant, outdoor forest scene rather than a dark indoor enclosure.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, it is filled edge-to-edge with a forest scene depicting a stylized warthog. There is no white border present that separates the artwork from the edges, which is indicative of a focus on full immersion into the depicted setting.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is no code or textual notation like '5A-H618' located anywhere in the bottom right corner or any other part of the image. The focus remains on the graphical representation and lacks any overlaid identifiers.",
