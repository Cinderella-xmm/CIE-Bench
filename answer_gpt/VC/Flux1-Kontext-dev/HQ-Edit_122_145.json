      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four figures wear kimonos with brightly colored obis tied around their waists, but unlike Image A, none of the bows are patterned, nor is the bow's back visible due to the front-facing poses.",

      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the kimonos primarily feature pink blossoms, consistent with cherry blossoms, but the presence of red and white is not visually identified. The patterns emphasize pink notably, linking to cherry blossoms traditionally associated with Japan.",

      ],
