      "question": "Is the \"POLICE\" and \"CME\" text present on the driver’s side door in the same position and font style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text on the driver’s side door says 'POLICE' twice (once near the front and once near the rear), and the font is unclear in terms of the original 'CME' style because there is no 'CME' text present. The text is large and visibly placed in the middle section of the door. In comparing this with Image A, the text 'CME' and 'POLICE' are in white and placed in specific positions but Image B lacks 'CME' text, indicating they are not in the same position and style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no badge emblem present on the driver’s side door. Analyzing Image A shows a recognizable gold-colored badge emblem on the door. This discrepancy confirms the absence of this feature in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the light bar on the rooftop has a clear red-blue-red-blue sequence from left to right. In Image A, it is observed that the light sequence is the same. Therefore, the sequence is correctly maintained.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front grille has a grid-like pattern and lacks horizontal slats or a central chrome bar. Comparing this with Image A, where horizontal slats are visible on the grille, it is clear they are different.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a license plate displaying 'LIP' above 'MISL UKRAINE'. Analyzing Image A shows 'LIP' above 'EAST. LUNIS', indicating that Image B does not display 'CHICAGO POLICE'.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the car in Image B includes the four doors with a long hood and trunk, indicating a typical sedan style. Image A shares the same sedan shape and features, affirming the consistency in silhouette.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the rectangular headlights and amber turn signals, but positioning seems central and does not indicate placement on fenders. This is unlike Image A where headlights and signals appear symmetrically on the fenders. Thus, the positioning in Image B does not match the fender positioning.",
