      "question": "Is the intricate engraved floral and scrollwork pattern on the teapot body still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot has an intricate floral and scrollwork pattern that is clearly visible on its body. These designs are prominently engraved, similar to the details commonly found on ornate porcelain or ceramic ware. The description of the pattern, its visibility, and intactness can be directly confirmed by closely observing the detailed engravings on the surface. This suggests that the ornate details are preserved and intact.",

      "question": "Does the teapot retain its rounded body, flared base, and domed lid with finial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a teapot with a rounded body and a distinctly flared base. The lid is domed and features a finial, consistent with classic teapot designs. These structural features are identifiable from the shape and contour visible in the image, which demonstrate the retention of these elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the reflective silver-metallic surface of the teapot preserved, showing clear highlights and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the teapot is more ceramic-like with a cream color and does not possess the reflective silver-metallic quality of Image A. It lacks the mirror-like reflective highlights and reflections that are characteristic of metal surfaces. This indicates a change in the material appearance from metallic to ceramic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the teapot retains a spout and handles that are similarly positioned to those in Image A. They preserve the same elegant, curved form that is characteristic of traditional teapots, maintaining the initial design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close analysis of Image B, decorative ridges and edge banding are present around the lid and base of the teapot. These details are visible and consistent with the design features typically found on classically styled teapots. Despite changes in material appearance, these specific decorative elements appear unchanged.",
