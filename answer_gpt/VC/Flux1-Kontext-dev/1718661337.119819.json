      "question": "Is the white powdered wig with tightly curled sides still present on the figure's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears a similar wig with visibly curled sides, characteristic of the powdered wigs of certain historical periods. This is indicated by the white curls that are part of the attire, even under the hat the figure wears. The visual cue is consistent with typical depictions of such wigs, allowing us to conclude that the wig is still present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a tricorne hat with a dark blue base and gold trim around the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears a different style of hat, which is not the traditional tricorne shape. Instead, it has a tall cylindrical structure more akin to a top hat, which is brown with additional embellishments and not dark blue with gold trim as previously described in Image A. This indicates a change in hat style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right hand extended forward, gripping an object with the thumb and fingers wrapped around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right hand is indeed extended forward and grips an object, a large watch-like device, with the fingers wrapped around it. The thumb is visible as part of the clasping action typical when holding an item, retaining this action.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left hand positioned near the lower torso, palm facing inward or downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand of the figure is visibly positioned near the lower torso. The positioning suggests that the hand is resting or relaxed by the side, consistent with the description of the palm facing inward or downward.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face is blurred in Image B, the facial features such as nose, eyes, and jawline cannot be assessed. As per the guidelines, the blurred face is not considered.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be in a three-quarter position, which is facing slightly to the right but angled toward the viewer. This positioning is observed by how the body and shoulders are oriented, maintaining the figure's pose.",
