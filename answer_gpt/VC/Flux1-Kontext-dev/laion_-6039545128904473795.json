    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone features four rotor assemblies, each located at its respective corner of the central body, indicating a symmetrical arrangement. This is a typical design for quadcopters which are known for stabilizing flight. The formations are evenly spaced, supporting the symmetrical configuration.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows yellow markings that appear triangular in shape. These markings are situated on the top, with triangle-like patterns discernible on the body sides as well, which is consistent with decorative accents often used to enhance visibility or aesthetics.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone does not visibly display any V-shaped landing supports. The design instead appears humanoid-like without the conventional drone landing gear such as V-forms typically used for landing stability.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a central body with distinct sharp and angular features and cuts. These design choices result in a polygonal structure contributing to a futuristic and aerodynamic look, which aligns with the stylized, advanced robotic theme.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the central body does feature three small rectangular elements, ostensibly lights, aligned horizontally. This configuration is typical for indicating status or function in tech devices.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the drone predominantly black with yellow accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a drone that is largely black, with yellow markings serving as accents. This combination is consistent with typical design schemes that utilize contrast for visibility and aesthetic appeal.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
