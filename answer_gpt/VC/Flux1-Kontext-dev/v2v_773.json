      "question": "Is there a single dark brown seed visible in the center of the apple's cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple forms the head of a figurine, showing the same vertical cross-section as a typical apple. The apple has a singular dark brown seed located at the center, similar to Apple's actual anatomy. By analyzing the visual cues where the apple's flesh is exposed, we see the presence of a single seed. Given these observations of the edited image, notably maintaining the apple's natural features, it confirms the seed's presence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the appleâ€™s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) portrays an apple with a flesh texture that appears dry and fibrous. This texture is emphasized by visible vein-like patterns across its surface, suggesting dehydration or aging. This aligns with the natural tendency for apples to wrinkle and show vein-like structures when exposed to air and dried.",

      "question": "Is there a dark brown stem attached to the top of the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the apple at the top of the figurine has a clearly visible dark brown stem, identical to what might be naturally seen on real apples. The presence of this stem on the apple part of the figure enhances the realism of the apple depiction in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an apple that forms the head of a figurine, with a vertical slice running through it. This cut reveals a symmetrical cross-section, presenting both apple halves with mirroring patterns, which is a typical characteristic of vertically sliced apples.",

      "question": "Is the apple placed on a flat, light gray, matte surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is part of a figurine setup. The entire arrangement, including the figurine with the apple head, is placed on a similarly flat and light-colored surface, but unlike the standalone apple in Image A, it doesn't showcase specifically a light gray matte surface as its direct rest base due to other added objects such as the box and the figurine stand. The overall context shows various details which may not precisely match the standalone apple setting's description.",
