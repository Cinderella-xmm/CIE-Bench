      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that resembles chicken wings has a golden-brown color, similar to fried or cooked chicken. This color is typically associated with crispy, cooked chicken, suggesting an intention to mimic that appearance. Since the plush objects are meant to look like chicken wings, they have adopted this same coloring.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush chicken wings have a shape that resembles real chicken wings, featuring parts that mimic drumettes and flats. The drumettes are thicker at one end, while the flats are generally more oval and elongated. The plush objects follow this form, suggesting an imitation of real chicken wings.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no small white bowl present. The object, which looks like a fuzzy orange pompom, is not inside a bowl. Therefore, there isn't an object inside a small white bowl to analyze in terms of color.",
