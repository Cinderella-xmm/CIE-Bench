      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hammer retain its claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the hammer retains its distinctive claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure. The claw is crucial for pulling nails, and the opposite smooth head is used for driving nails, which is a common hammer design. The hammer handle appears modern in blue, but the fundamental design features remain unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chisel retain its flat, rectangular blade with a beveled edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chisel is identifiable by its flat, rectangular blade, common in woodworking for precision shaping. A beveled edge allows for effective carving. This characteristic shape remains evident despite possible color or texture changes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the file retain its long, straight, narrow shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The file in Image B maintains the essential long, straight, narrow shape typical in metal and woodwork for smoothing surfaces. These attributes are visible despite any color alterations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tools positioned in the same relative arrangement as in the original image (e.g., hammer diagonal, chisel crossing file)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the arrangement is consistent with Image A; the hammer remains diagonal, with the chisel intersecting the file, similar to their spatial relation in the original image. Comparing Image A confirms the unchanged positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shavings retain their curled, ribbon-like shape and approximate distribution around the tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shavings appear in a curled, ribbon-like shape, characteristic of woodwork when tools carve wood. They are distributed around the tools, consistent with Image A's display. A comparison confirms the similar appearance and placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly five tools present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows five tools, consistent with the original count in Image A. The presence of a hammer, chisel, file, and other specific tools confirms this quantity. Visual comparison verifies unchanged tool count.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the wrench-like tool retain its open-ended jaw and metal shaft shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wrench-like tool is visible with an open-ended jaw and a metal shaft, features allowing for gripping and turning fasteners. These are unchanged despite edits to its appearance like color alterations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
