    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central character (derived from the green block) positioned exactly in the middle of the composition, surrounded by other characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the central character, represented by the green block, is indeed placed centrally within the composition. It is highlighted by the presence of two additional characters to its side, enhancing the middle placement by creating a balanced visual arrangement. The central position is emphasized by the surrounding visual elements and the interactions between characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the characters derived from the blocks retain the circular stud pattern on their upper surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B, derived from red block designs, are observed with heads that incorporate the circular stud pattern, similar to the original block design. This pattern creates a visual link between the new characters and their block origin.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the characters derived from the blocks primarily composed of rectangular or boxy shapes, preserving the original block geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters maintain a significant degree of rectangular or boxy geometry in their structure. Their heads are effectively rendered to mimic the shape and form of the original block's geometry, and their overall body design reflects the block-like aspect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the composition filled with a dense cluster of characters (originally blocks), arranged in a piled, overlapping manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a significantly different arrangement than Image A. It shows two distinct characters against a softer background with spacing rather than a densely packed group of overlapping blocks. The characters are more isolated, creating an open composition without overlapping elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there only one character (derived from the green block) that differs in color or design from the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green block character stands out in color and design, contrasting with the red block-headed characters beside it. This difference is visually significant, highlighting the unique presence of the green block within the composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the characters derived from the blocks retain any visual indication of interlocking mechanisms (such as recessed areas or connectors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image transformations into characters do not retain the recessed areas or connectors needed for interlocking with other blocks. Instead, the focus shifts to the character design elements, such as facial features and body form, without explicit interlocking mechanisms visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
