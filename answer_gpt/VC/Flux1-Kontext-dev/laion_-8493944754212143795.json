    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are areas on the water surface that appear noticeably brighter, giving the impression of sunlight reflecting off the water. These bright spots suggest the presence of natural light creating sparkles and highlights, which is a common phenomenon when sunlight hits water surfaces.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible patches of green moss or algae on the rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly discernible sections of the rocks that have a green hue, indicative of the presence of moss or algae. Such growths are typical in moist environments, like those found around waterfalls or streams, where water continuously provides the necessary moisture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water at the base of the cascade and along the edges is white and frothy. This appearance is characteristic of water that has been aerated through agitation, such as when it crashes against rocks, typical of a fast-flowing cascade.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rocks exhibit a layered, stepped formation with visible cracks and erosion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks display a tiered, step-like formation and show signs of wear and tear through visible cracks and erosion lines. Such formations are characteristic of geological processes where water erosion over time creates distinct layers and features on rock surfaces.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the water flow downward from the upper part of the image toward the lower part?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the direction of the water flow is clearly from the upper section of the image toward the lower section. This is consistent with the natural dynamics of gravity, which causes water to flow from higher elevations to lower ones in a cascading motion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark, wet rock surfaces and the bright, fast-moving water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a noticeable contrast between the dark surfaces of wet rocks and the bright, rapidly moving water. This contrast highlights the difference in texture and color that occurs when water is moving swiftly over surfaces that are wet versus those that are dry or less illuminated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible water droplets or mist suspended in the air above the falling water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of falling water, there are no evident droplets or mist suspended in the air, which would typically occur as water forcefully hits surfaces and disperses into the air. The absence of such visible mist or droplets suggests a cleaner visual depiction without suspended particles in the air.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
