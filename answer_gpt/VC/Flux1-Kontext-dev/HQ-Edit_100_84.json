      "question": "Are there exactly three triangular sails attached to the dhow, arranged in a staggered vertical line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the three triangular sails is clear; they are set in a staggered vertical line on the dhow. The sails are drawn with distinct separations and seem to rise one above the other, fitting the description perfectly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a wooden hull with visible arched windows and decorative lattice railings along the upper deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the dhow is illustrated with a wooden hull. Arched windows are present, exhibiting artistic details, and decorative designs are visible on the railing along the upper deck. These features are typical of traditional Arabian dhows, embodying both the aesthetic and structural aspects.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dhow oriented diagonally across the frame, with its bow pointing toward the upper right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow is positioned with its bow clearly pointing towards the upper right of the frame, giving a sense of motion and direction and aligning with traditional representations in poster art. The diagonal orientation is evident from the way the vessel is displayed within the graphic boundaries.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple small sailboats visible on the horizon in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are a few small sailboats depicted in the background. These sailboats are set against the horizon, adding depth and context to the scene, which is common in nautical illustrations to convey a busy or active sea.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the left side of the image, casting a bright golden reflection across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun's position is captured in an idealistic artistic style more so than realistic placement. It is integrated into the aesthetic of the sky, but not specifically aligned as a natural element casting real-world reflections in golden hues across waterâ€”a technique often employed in illustration to highlight atmosphere rather than direct imagery.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible wake and reflection of the dhow beneath its hull on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no realistic wake or reflection visible beneath the dhow. The image takes on a stylized or graphic approach that does not emphasize natural water physics like wakes or reflections, focusing instead on decorative, flat, and detailed outlines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the dhow have a long, pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the dhow with a highly stylized, ornate bow that extends forward from the hull, a common characteristic in traditional dhow representations to both enhance aerodynamic form and aesthetic appeal.",
