    "Question": "Q1: Is the scientist depicted with her right hand holding a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist's right hand is indeed holding an instrument that resembles a pipette, angled towards the test tubes on the table. The depiction of the hand's position and the tool's orientation suggest its function aligns with common laboratory practices, where scientists use such tools for precision work with test tubes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there multiple test tubes arranged in metal racks, containing teal or greenish-blue liquid?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows several test tubes organized in metal racks on the workbench. The liquid within these test tubes is distinctly teal or greenish-blue, which is consistent with the portrayal of laboratory materials which often exhibit vivid colors for chemical identification purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a microscope visible on the right side of the workbench, with an eyepiece and stage clearly defined?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the device visible on the right of the workbench could initially be mistaken for a microscope; however, it lacks defining features such as an eyepiece and stage. Instead, its structure and on-screen displays suggest it is part of a digital interface, commonly utilized in modern labs for molecular analysis.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two digital screens in the background displaying circular, intricate, symmetrical molecular or crystalline patterns in blue-green tones?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows two digital screens in the background, both of which display complex designs that appear circular and symmetrical, hinting at molecular or crystalline structures. These patterns are rendered in blue-green tones, aligning with scientific visualizations used for examining molecular data.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the scientist wear a white lab coat and round-framed glasses?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the scientist dressed in a typical white lab coat, which is a staple attire for laboratory work indicating professionalism and safety. Furthermore, she wears glasses with round frames, a practical choice often preferred in labs for vision support.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the liquids in the test tubes colored in shades of teal or greenish-blue?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays test tubes filled with liquids that exhibit shades of teal or greenish-blue. The portrayal of these vivid colors is intentional, serving to indicate the chemical substances within and enhancing the scientific atmosphere of the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the scientist positioned in front of the test tubes, with the microscope to her right and digital screens behind her?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the scientist standing in front of the test tubes, which are prominently featured on the workbench. However, the right-side instrument is not a microscope; it looks more like a digital interface panel. Digital screens displaying molecular graphics are positioned in the background, maintaining the spatial arrangement described.",
    "answer": "Yes"
