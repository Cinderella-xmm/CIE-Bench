      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image retain large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the elephant with large ears extending outward from its head, a distinctive feature of the African elephant. The size and shape of these ears are often used to identify an African elephant, as they are larger and fan-shaped compared to other elephant species.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the elephant’s tusks long, curved, and off-white in color, extending downward from the upper jaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant has tusks that are long, curved, and off-white in color, extending from the upper jaw, which matches typical tusk characteristics seen in elephants. This visual cue aligns with common characteristics of elephant tusks.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the elephant’s skin depicted with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly on the trunk, legs, and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skin of the elephant in Image B is shown with deep wrinkles and folds, especially visible on the trunk, legs, and ears. These textural details are consistent with the typical appearance of an elephant's skin, which often includes pronounced wrinkles and folds.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet show five distinct toes on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the elephant do not visually suggest five distinct toes. Typically, an elephant's toes are not individually distinct due to the structure of their feet, and this characteristic appears consistent in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the backpack is depicted in a rich, saturated red color. The edited image maintains the same vividness and color intensity of the backpack as seen in the original image.",

      "question": "Is the backpack present as a separate object positioned near the elephant in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is positioned separately near the elephant, clearly distinguishable as a separate object within the scene. This positioning mirrors the arrangement seen in Image A, where the backpack is also distinct from the elephant.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the animal clearly identifiable as an African elephant based on its ear size, tusk shape, and overall body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an elephant with large, fan-shaped ears, long curved tusks, and a robust body structure, all indicators of an African elephant. These specific features are characteristic identifiers used to distinguish African elephants from other species, reinforcing the conclusion.",
