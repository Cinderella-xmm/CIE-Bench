    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central archway positioned at the center of the main structure, forming a passageway between the two vertical pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central archway is clearly visible as part of the main structure and forms a prominent passageway, situated symmetrically between two vertical pillars. This design element replicates traditional architectural forms where a large arch connects or divides two vertical supports.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two vertical pillars standing symmetrically on either side of the central archway, forming a tall, narrow gateway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the two vertical pillars flanking the central archway do indeed appear to be positioned symmetrically. This symmetry creates a tall, narrow gateway form, a common architectural design observed in historical fortifications or castles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the battlements along the top of the structure composed of repeating rectangular merlons and gaps (crenels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a structure with a classic battlement design at the top, consisting of alternating solid merlons and negative spaces, known as crenels. This arrangement is typical of fortified structures meant for defense and indicative of medieval architecture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a long, low brick wall running parallel to the main structure on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a long, low brick wall is evident on the left side of the picture, running parallel to the main structure. This orientation implies it might serve as a boundary or additional fortification element in the architectural layout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a paved pathway extending from the foreground toward the central archway, running between the low wall and the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a distinct paved pathway starting in the foreground and leading toward the central archway. It runs between the low wall on the left and the main structure on the right, guiding the viewer’s eyes through the composition toward the structure’s opening.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central archway, integrated into the same wall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, additional arched openings are noticeable to the right of the main central archway, integrated within the same wall structure. This architectural feature is typical in constructions that require multiple accesses or aesthetic continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the small human figure located on the pathway, positioned behind the viewer and moving toward the central archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small human figure is situated on the pathway, oriented in a fashion that suggests they are moving away from the viewer toward the central archway. This directionality is reinforced by the figure’s lighting and position within the pathway context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
