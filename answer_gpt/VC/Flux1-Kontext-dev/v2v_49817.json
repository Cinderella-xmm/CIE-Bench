      "question": "Is the pencil sharpener still present and serving its function in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil sharpener is visible on the table. An individual is interacting with it, as indicated by the hand gripping the handle, suggesting that the sharpener is present and continuing to serve its function. Comparing with Image A, the pencil sharpener's position and interaction appear unchanged, affirming its role in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three individuals still interacting in their respective roles (scribe, observer, attendant)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the individuals suggests their respective roles: one individual appears to be sharpening a pencil, indicating a scribe role, while another gesturing seems to be engaged, suggesting a possible communication or attendant role. The positioning of the third individual implies observer status. Comparing with Image A, each person's role appears unchanged, supporting consistent interaction as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a wall with elements that don't resemble large windows. Instead, there are decorations or panels suggesting a different setting. Comparing with Image A, where large windows are clearly part of the background, shows a significant change in the backdrop appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, items resembling papers are visible on the table, and writing utensils are present. This suggests that, akin to Image A, these elements continue to be part of the table setup, indicating scattered papers and pencils remain visible.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement of the individuals remains similar to that in Image A. Relative positions, such as proximity and geometric orientation, appear unchanged, suggesting consistency in their spatial arrangement.",
