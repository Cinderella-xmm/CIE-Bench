    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish is depicted in a continuous circular coil with the head pointing toward the upper right and the tail curving beneath it, creating a nearly complete circle. This is visually clear as the fish's body forms a loop, common in stylized circular fish representations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the head area of the fish, there is no visual evidence of distinguishing three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw. Barbels are typically long, thin appendages that may not be detailed in stylized sculptures like this one.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish with a design that appears serrated. It has sharp, pointed edges which resemble the serrations commonly seen in artistic depictions of fish fins.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish's body is detailed with scales arranged in overlapping rows, running from the head down to the tail, which is typical in most fish depictions to illustrate texture and realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the fish indeed curves underneath the body and connects near the head, creating a nearly closed circular form, which is evident from the visual configuration of the fish's body.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish has visible pectoral fins, but these types of stylized sculptures often show a reduced number of anatomical features for simplicity, and I see a visible fin near the head but not sufficiently detailed evidence of a second fin further back.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the fish sculpture as freestanding, without any panel or frame, let alone a square-shaped panel with rounded corners. The focus of Image B is solely on the fish sculpture itself.",
