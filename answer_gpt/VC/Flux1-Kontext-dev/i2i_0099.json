      "question": "Is the mug still predominantly turquoise blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug retains a predominant blue hue, although the artistic filter creates swirling patterns of yellow and orange, the base color is still primarily a shade of blue. Based on common color perception, the blue dominates over other colors suggesting it is predominantly turquoise blue.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the mug retain its round shape with a handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the overlay of the artistic filter that adds texture, the mug’s round shape and handle are clearly discernible. These structural features remain unchanged, evident through the outlines visible in the edited image, indicating that the mug retains its round shape with a handle.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a circular coaster under the mug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a circular shape is visible beneath the mug, similar to what a coaster would be. Despite the stylistic changes caused by the artistic filter, this shape is consistent with the appearance of a coaster. By comparing with common knowledge that coasters are often used under mugs, it confirms that the item is a coaster.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the beverage level in the mug still visibly filled to a similar height as the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beverage still appears to be at a similar height as in Image A. The edited visual effect does not obscure the liquid’s surface, which appears filled up to a similar level as in the original image. This is indicated by the visible line delineating the beverage level from the inner sides of the mug.",

      "question": "Is the mug still centrally positioned on the coaster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug appears centrally aligned on the coaster. Despite the swirling artistic style, the visual placement of the mug in relation to the coaster suggests a central positioning, given the balance and even distribution of visual weight around the edges.",
