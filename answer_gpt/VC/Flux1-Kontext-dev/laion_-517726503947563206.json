      "question": "Is the text \"Aurora\" visible on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible text 'Aurora' on the side of the ship. The texture and design of the ship look crystalline and abstract, which obscures any clearer markings that might have been present originally. Without the ability to discern specific text due to the artistic alteration, the answer is determined as No.",

      "question": "Is the registration number \"QV-8880\" visible on the hull of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the ship with significant artistic edits that give it a crystalline appearance. These edits obscure detailed features, such as text or numbers that might typically appear on the ship's hull, like the registration number 'QV-8880'. Thus, due to the abstract representation, No registration number is visible as a result of these modifications.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a red flag visible at the top of the shipâ€™s mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While analyzing Image B, the top of the ship's mast does show a red flag. This flag can be identified through its color and location despite the artistic changes to the overall ship design, which maintains the notion of a flagpole position. Hence, a red flag is visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ship oriented in a side profile view, facing toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is depicted in a side-profile view where its bow points towards the right side of the image. This orientation maintenance provides familiarity of the ship profile despite its eventual graphical transformation, confirming that the ship indeed faces towards the right of the frame.",

      "question": "Is the ship depicted as floating on a body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ship without any environmental elements such as water surrounding it. The ship appears suspended or floating in an undefined space, no water depicted that suggests it is moored or moving on a body of water. Thus, the ship in this artistic setting is not made to appear floating on water.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the ship positioned near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is centrally located with relatively equal space from both sides of the image appearing as the focal point of the artwork. Positioned prominently, it provides an unmissable central visual component in the image.",
