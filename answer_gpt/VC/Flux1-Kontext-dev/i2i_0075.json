      "question": "Is the cat depicted with fluffy white fur that maintains its distinct texture and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is illustrated with white fur, but the style is simplified due to the nature of illustrations. It has the appearance of white fur, but lacks the distinct texture and fluffiness seen in photographs. Compared to Image A, which shows a realistic depiction with clear textures, the illustration in Image B smooths these details out. Therefore, while the fur is white, it does not preserve the distinct fluffy texture.",

      "question": "Does the illustration retain the cat's yellow-green eyes with visible pupils reflecting the original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are illustrated with a yellow-green color and visible pupils, reflecting a cartoonish style that still captures a recognizable element of the cat's eyes. Image A shows realistic eyes with the same general color scheme. The illustration does maintain the essential characteristics such as color and pupils, although in a simplified format.",

      "question": "Are the cat’s pink inner ears accurately represented in terms of color and shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inner ears of the cat are depicted with a pink hue, consistent with what is typically seen in real cat imagery. The overall shape of the ears is maintained in a simplified form. Image A shows realistic inner ears, also pink, so the illustration retains these features accurately in a stylized manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the illustration preserve the cat’s relaxed posture with extended paws, consistent with its original positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is sitting rather than lying down with extended paws as seen in Image A. The relaxed, lying down posture linked with extended paws that is present in Image A is not depicted in Image B, where the cat is shown in an upright, more alert sitting position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no representation of any cushion pattern. The surface under the illustrated cats is completely plain, lacking the intricate patterns visible in Image A's bedding cushion.",
