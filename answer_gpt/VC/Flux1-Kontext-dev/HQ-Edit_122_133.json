      "question": "Is the cardinal’s body predominantly bright red with a black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is depicted as a figure with human-like features and is dressed in a red outfit, resembling a Santa Claus costume. The head of the figure is a cardinal's head, which maintains its natural bright red color and the typical black facial mask around the beak area. Thus, while the body is not naturally colored due to the attire, the facial mask area, which includes the head, does retain its black color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue jay is shown in a human-like form wearing a blue coat. The bird maintains its natural features, such as a blue crest and wings with the distinctive alternating blue and white bars, even while it is dressed in clothing. These features are characteristic of blue jays and are visually present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is there visible snow resting on the cardinal’s head and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal is dressed in a red outfit akin to Santa Claus, in a box-like display setting. The setting inside the frame does not show any snow resting on the cardinal’s head or back, as it is indoors within a diorama-like space. The image contextually presents a snowy theme, yet unlike the natural scene in Image A, Image B lacks any snow on the cardinal itself.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue jay maintains its natural avian features to some extent, despite being dressed in clothing and placed within a display box. The beak of the blue jay in Image B is indeed black, which corresponds to the typical coloration of a blue jay's beak.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cardinal and blue jay in a diorama, wearing clothes and situated in box-like displays rather than on natural branches. There are elements resembling winter with artificial trees and snow, but the birds are not perched on snow-covered pine branches with visible needles, as they are in a more crafted indoor setting. Image A shows them on natural pine branches, but this is markedly different in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal retains realistic features such as a bright red color with a black facial mask on its head. Consistent with its natural appearance, it possesses an orange-red beak, which is a distinctive feature of cardinals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are placed each in their own display boxes, side by side. This creates separate sections for each bird, similar to being in separate vertical sections, as they are distinctly presented in different areas within a single frame. This separation mirrors the positioning in Image A but is more stylized in Image B.",
