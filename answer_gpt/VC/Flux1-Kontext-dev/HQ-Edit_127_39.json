        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a mystical figure integrated with the Eiffel Tower.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the space under the archway of the Eiffel Tower is filled with various visual elements suggesting a magical scenario instead of offering any view of a classical-style building.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the presence of trimmed green hedges flanking both sides similar to a park setting, though the environment is transformed into a magical context. Despite the change in theme, the original symmetrical arrangement of hedges remains recognizable.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image incorporates an altered, magical scene where human figures are not depicted in activity such as sitting or walking on the grassy field. Instead, the area features magical designs and flows of ethereal energy, emphasizing a fantasy setting devoid of human presence.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sky lacks any gradient from deep blue to orange as seen in natural dusk or dawn settings. Instead, it showcases a dark, nocturnal scene complementing the mystical atmosphere with deep, dark shades, typical of a night setting. The gradient associated with daylight transition is not evident.",

The visual continuity of illuminated hedges through glowing elements is retained, aligning with a supernatural atmosphere.",
