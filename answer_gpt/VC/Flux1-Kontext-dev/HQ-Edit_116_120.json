        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag is clearly positioned above the tallest spire at the center of the sandcastle, indicating prominence in placement typical of flags atop central towers. The spire's height is implied by its position and role within the structure, serving as the central point around which other towers are arranged.",
