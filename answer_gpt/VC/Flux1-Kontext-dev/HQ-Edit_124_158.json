      "question": "Is the cat's fur pattern composed of dark brown or black stripes over a golden-orange base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur pattern appears with distinct dark stripes or bands that are likely black on a lighter, warm base color that resembles golden-orange.

      "question": "Does the cat have greenish-blue eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes appear to be a mix of green and blue tones. This suggests that the cat has a unique eye color that blends these hues. Cats can naturally have multicolored eyes, often adding a striking feature to their appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's position shows its front paws placed in a relaxed manner, but they are not crossed over its chest. Instead, they are resting on its body or close to each other but not in a crossed position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the settee, there are throw pillows visible with floral patterns. They appear to have red flowers on a lighter, possibly cream background. There are two pillows positioned on either side of the cat, indicating they are indeed flanking it.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's tail is visible and appears to be positioned along the edge of the settee, more specifically on the cat's left side when viewing the image. The curl in the tail's posture along the settee suggests this positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the settee features an upholstery that appears to be a rich, deep red color. Velvet fabric is typically luxurious and has a soft, plush appearance, which aligns with the visual texture and tone of the settee seen in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the cat have a white muzzle and long white whiskers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat’s muzzle area does not seem to be distinctly white, rather it is consistent with the surrounding fur color, which is a mix of the stripe pattern. However, the cat does have long whiskers, but they align more with the fur color or are lightly highlighted against the face.",
