    "Question": "Q1: Is the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps present and unchanged in shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears futuristic, with neon outlines emphasizing its geometric shape. The headdress has angular and symmetrical features, designed with clear lines and side flaps, consistent with how such a headdress might look. Based on the appearance and comparison, there is no indication the shape or position has changed from the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the eyes glowing amber in color and positioned symmetrically within the face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is stylized with a neon-light effect, which does not specify the color of the eyes being amber, nor is there explicit evidence of eye placement due to the blur. Since there's no observable feature matching 'glowing amber eyes', it's unlikely this characteristic is present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the stepped stone pedestal base present with distinct horizontal layers forming a pyramidal shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly defined base with geometric forms and horizontal layers emphasized by neon outlines. This base configuration retains the original vision of a stepped pedestal that appears to form a pyramidal shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the segmented mechanical joints visible along the neck, beneath a translucent casing?",
    "explanation": "Image B doesn't display any apparent mechanical segments visible along the neck in the way one would expect under translucent casings. The emphasis appears to be more on the stylized neon-lit design, rather than intricate mechanical details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the head oriented directly forward, facing the viewer without rotation or tilt?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neon outlines and the positioning of head features suggest the orientation is facing directly forward. This is inferred given the symmetrical design and direct alignment seen in sculptures facing forward.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the face symmetrically structured with aligned nose, lips, and jawline?",
    "explanation": "Since the face is blurred in Image B, the symmetry of the facial features such as the nose, lips, and jawline cannot be confirmed. Without clear detailed structures visible, it isn't possible to ascertain this symmetry.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the head positioned directly atop the stepped pedestal, supported by it without floating or being detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neon stylized structure indicates the head or central feature is directly supported by the stepped pedestal. The visible continuity from the base to the top underlines the absence of a floating appearance. ",
    "answer": "Yes"
