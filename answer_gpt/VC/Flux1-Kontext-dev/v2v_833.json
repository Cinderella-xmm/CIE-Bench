      "question": "Does the subject maintain the iconic pose and subtle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a character seated at a table, holding a mug with both hands. Despite the blurred face directly interfering with the ability to see facial expressions, the posture and attention to sartorial detail suggest the remnant of the classical pose made famous by the Mona Lisa. The inability to see the smile due to the blur makes it impossible to confirm the presence of the subtle smile, but the pose remains recognizable.",
