      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure retain the large hind legs characteristic of a kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the Funko Pop figure has small, stubby legs, which are typical of exaggerated cartoon or chibi designs. Kangaroos are known for their large hind legs which aid in hopping, but these are not retained in the representation of the Funko Pop figure, relying on stylistic choices common in such figures for a more compact, cuddlier appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the long tail of the kangaroo preserved in the Funko Pop figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows the Funko Pop figure has a fairly long tail, which corresponds to the long tail characteristic of kangaroos. The depiction appears to retain the length much closer to the real kangaroo’s proportions compared to the stubby legs.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box include a pouch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box is shown with a pouch, as indicated by its hands resting over an area typically associated with a kangaroo pouch. This aligns with the known anatomical feature of kangaroos.",

      "question": "Is the Funko Pop figure primarily colored brown to reflect the original kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure is predominantly brown, matching the typical coloration of a kangaroo as seen in Image A. This reflects the creator’s intention to maintain a color likeness to the real animal to be visually recognizable and familiar.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail) depicted in the chibi-style figure inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure inside the box features a long tail, which is an element used for balance in kangaroos during hopping. However, the exaggerated design of the figure shows small legs, which deviates from the large hind legs necessary for hopping, thus omitting an integral aspect of kangaroo biology and mobility. Hence, only the tail is depicted while the necessary large hind legs are not.",
