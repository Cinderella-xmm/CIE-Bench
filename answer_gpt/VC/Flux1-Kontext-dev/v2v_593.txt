    "Question": "Q1: Does the Funko Pop figure retain the large hind legs characteristic of a kangaroo?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the Funko Pop figure has small, stubby legs, which are typical of exaggerated cartoon or chibi designs. Kangaroos are known for their large hind legs which aid in hopping, but these are not retained in the representation of the Funko Pop figure, relying on stylistic choices common in such figures for a more compact, cuddlier appearance.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail) depicted in the chibi-style figure inside the box?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure inside the box features a long tail, which is an element used for balance in kangaroos during hopping. However, the exaggerated design of the figure shows small legs, which deviates from the large hind legs necessary for hopping, thus omitting an integral aspect of kangaroo biology and mobility. Hence, only the tail is depicted while the necessary large hind legs are not.",
    "answer": "No"
