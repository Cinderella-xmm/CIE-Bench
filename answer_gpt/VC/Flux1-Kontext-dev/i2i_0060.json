        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject is a plated dish, which lacks any animal or elephant features, including a baby elephant's skin texture. Instead, the image focuses on a culinary presentation with various foods that do not resemble the texture of an elephant's skin. Therefore, the image does not retain the baby elephant's wrinkled gray skin texture.",

      "question": "Is the baby elephant depicted with small ears compared to its body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a high-end plated dish with no representation or depiction of a baby elephant or any animal, making the question regarding the size of elephant ears irrelevant to the image. Since there is no elephant at all in the edited image, it cannot show an elephant with ears smaller in proportion to its body.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a baby elephant; instead, there is a sophisticated dish. Thus, there is no trunk, short or otherwise, featured in this image at all.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a photograph of a plated dish, without any elements resembling vertical metal bars. The edited image focuses entirely on food items without inclusion of any metal bar-like structures.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible ground as the entire focus of the frame is on the presentation of a dish on a white plate. Consequently, the question about the presence of reddish dirt on the ground is not applicable to the edited image.",
