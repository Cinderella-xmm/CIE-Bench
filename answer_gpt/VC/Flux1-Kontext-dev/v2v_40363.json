        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the child appears more stylized compared to Image A. The child has been transformed from a silhouette-style artwork to a more detailed and colorful cartoon-like representation. The position of the child, however, remains consistent with the child extending an arm towards the balloon. Therefore, while the shape has changed in this transition to a more detailed depiction, the position is preserved.",
