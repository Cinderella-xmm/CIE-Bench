      "question": "Is the vase's overall shape preserved, including its three-panel body, twin scrolled handles, and flared neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is a clear glass vase with a simple, curvy shape. It lacks the ornate design elements such as a three-panel body or twin scrolled handles seen in the ornate, decorative vases, which can be observed from its transparent and minimalistic design. This suggests it does not maintain the features like scrolled handles and intricate panel designs typical in vases with such detailed embellishments.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bouquet extend beyond the rim of the vase, creating an overflowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet is neatly arranged within the glass vase, with the stems visible and positioned mostly upright. The flowers do not appear to extend significantly beyond the vase's rim to create an overflowing effect. This type of arrangement usually involves a more controlled, tidy composition which contrasts with bouquets that overflow beyond their container.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings of the vase, including the surface it rests on, are clear and without any scattered flowers. The setting is minimal and emphasizes the bouquet and vase without additional elements like scattered flowers. This suggests the absence of pink poppies and blue blooms on the pedestal surface.",

    {

      "question": "Is the vase positioned centrally on the pedestal within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is centrally placed on a clear pedestal within the image frame. The symmetry and balance of the image are maintained, which are common practices in photography to create a pleasing and focused composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do some of the flowers rest directly on the surface of the pedestal, separate from the main bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are all contained within the vase, and no flowers are resting separately on the pedestal. The image has a clean and organized appeal with all floral elements accounted for in the main arrangement. This implies that no flowers are placed separately on the pedestal.",
