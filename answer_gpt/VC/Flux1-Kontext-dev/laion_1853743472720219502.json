    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the wooden surface with visible grain patterns and warm brown tones present and unaltered in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key visual element is a vibrant, fantastical phoenix perched on a branch against a wooden background. The wooden surface is dark, likely to contrast the fiery colors of the phoenix, which is inconsistent with warm brown tones and visible grain patterns. Thus, based on the visual content of Image B, a warm brown-toned wooden surface does not appear prominent or unaltered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two feather pendants positioned such that one is in the foreground and the other is partially overlapped behind it, maintaining the original diagonal alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main object is a phoenix rather than feather pendants. There is no indication of any feather pendants in the scene. Therefore, the referenced alignment of overlapped feather pendants is not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pendants cast soft, consistent shadows beneath them on the wooden surface, indicating overhead lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, there are no pendants casting shadows. Instead, the image features a phoenix without any objects like pendants casting shadows. The question pertains to an element not represented in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pendants aligned diagonally across the frame, extending from the lower-left toward the upper-right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main visual feature is a phoenix resting on a branch, and there are no pendants ordered diagonally across the image. Therefore, this diagonal alignment of pendants is not depicted in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden surface retain its natural grain texture, including variations in tone and minor imperfections, without digital smoothing or enhancement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dark wooden background behind the phoenix. The wood appears smooth and lacks detailed natural grain texture, variations, and imperfections that would suggest an enhanced or artistically rendered backdrop. Therefore, it does not have the natural grain texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the edge of the leather feather clearly defined against the wooden surface, showing a slight separation and shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, does not include any leather feathers. Instead, it features a phoenix, making any observation of a leather feather on a wooden surface irrelevant.",
