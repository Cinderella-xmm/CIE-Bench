    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all leaf-shaped elements in the image, including those used as heads, clearly five-pointed maple leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf-shaped elements are identifiable by their distinct shape and pointed segments reminiscent of maple leaves. There are no deviations or alternate leaf types present, indicating they are consistently five-pointed maple leaves. This includes those functioning as heads for the characters. Image B consistently uses this shape across all leaf elements visible. Therefore, combining visual cues with knowledge of leaf shapes, it's evident they are all maple leaves.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all leaf elements rendered exclusively in shades of orange, yellow, and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf elements exhibit colors within the autumn spectrum, namely shades of orange, yellow, and red, aligning with typical autumn foliage. There are no additional colors outside this range, such as green or purple. This choice is consistent with themes associated with autumnal settings. Thus, by observing the image using common color associations with fall, it's evident that the leaf color palette is strictly within the specified shades.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a solid brown rectangular border surrounding the central illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a border around its central elements, which is identified as a rectangular boundary. The border appears solid and brown, encircling the central illustration and separating it from outer elements. By examining the visual composition, the presence of a clearly defined, consistent brown border can be confirmed, reflecting a typical framing mechanism.",

      "question": "Is the background of the card uniformly white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not exhibit a uniform white color. Observing the overall color palette, the space surrounding the central illustration and border shows a cream or light beige tone instead. This suggests variation in the background color. Image A shows a clear white background, but Image B reflects more variation perhaps for thematic effects. Therefore, comparison indicates a deviation from uniform whiteness.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the central illustration positioned centrally within the card, bounded by the rectangular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B positions its central illustration within a bordered frame. The tree and character elements are bounded by a rectangular frame, affirming central placement. However, assessing balance and alignment also considers the specific positioning within space, which appears visually centered. Image A follows central alignment as well, supporting this placement approach. Hence, comparing both images substantiates the reasoning of a central bounding by a frame.",
