        "** Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is visually positioned with both hands placed firmly on the ground, and their body appears parallel to the surface. The toes are the only other point of contact with the ground, indicating a proper plank position. By world knowledge, this is the typical form of a plank, where the body is held horizontally and supported by hands and toes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, clearly shows the subject adorned in a sleeveless top that exposes their arms, alongside shorts that come above the knees. This aligns with common attire for physical activities, providing freedom of movement and comfort.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is enclosed within a transparent display case, which features a gradient background transitioning from a lighter shade at the bottom to darker hues at the top. This gradient, coupled with the simple display surroundings, offers a minimalistic aesthetic by focusing the attention on the subject and maintaining an uncluttered environment.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the subject in a way where their arms and shoulders exhibit noticeable muscle definition. The lighting and positioning highlight the contours and definition of muscles, which commonly suggests physical strength and fitness due to regular exercise or training.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No  \n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face in Image B is blurred, the general posturing and head orientation can be assessed. The subject's head is positioned such that it seems slightly raised from a neutral straight alignment; however, without clear visibility of the eyes or facial expression, it is difficult to conclusively denote it as 'looking upward'. Determination via facial expression in this case is not discernible.",
