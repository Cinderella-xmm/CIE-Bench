      "question": "Are the three large arched windows on the upper level of the building present and arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of three large arched windows is evident.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tall vertical black sign can be observed clearly in Image B, located at the top center of the building facade. Centrally placed signs are a common architectural feature for establishing a focal point, especially in commercial buildings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative cornice with spire-like finials is visible in Image B, running along the roofline of the building. Such features are often used in architecture to add intricacy and draw attention to the roof area.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Walgreens and Marina Theater signs previously present in Image A are missing. The ground floor areas where these signs would have been, based on prior architectural layouts, are blank without specific labeling or script lettering.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features three vintage cars positioned in front of the building, rather than two aligned specifically with each entrance. The presence of an additional car and their shifted alignment suggests a departure from the referenced positioning specific to the Walgreens and Marina Theater entrances.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small figures resembling people are visible near the central entrance area. While not explicitly by the labeled Walgreens and Marina Theater entrances (since those labels aren't present), these figures suggest some human presence near building access points.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
