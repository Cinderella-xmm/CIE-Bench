      "question": "Are the shrimp rendered in a pink-orange color consistent with cooked shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic-like style includes shrimp that are represented using a vibrant and exaggerated orange color. This color is representative of what is generally perceived as cooked shrimp, drawing from common knowledge that shrimp turn a pink or orange shade when cooked. The depiction is intended to highlight their cooked nature in an exaggerated cartoon manner.",

      "question": "Is there visible red spice coating on the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimps are surrounded by stylized symbols indicating seasoning or spices, such as floating spice particles, but the shrimps themselves do not have visible red spice coating. Instead, these spices are artistically implied in the scene around the shrimp with no direct reddish coating visible on the shrimp themselves.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B has visual elements that simulate chopped green herbs sprinkled over the food, consistent with cartoon symbols for herbs as they are liberally drawn around the shrimp and surrounding elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are depicted mostly maintaining a curled posture similar to a 'C' shape, which aligns with a common presentation of cooked shrimp due to the contraction of muscle fibers resulting from cooking.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a cartoon style where the shrimp are placed in a pan which resembles a stainless steel pan as indicated by the comic drawings, but this does not include rivets nor the exact features seen in Image A. Instead, it has a simplified, illustrative design fitting the comic context with no realistic rivet details.",
