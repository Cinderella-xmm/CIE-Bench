    "Question": "Q2: Does the carrot maintain its conical shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot retains its conical shape, characterized by a pointed end at the bottom and a broader top where the leaves are attached. This conical form is typical for most carrots, allowing them to be rooted effectively in soil. The shape can be determined by observing the gradient between the thin bottom and the wider top of the carrot.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the tapered top end of the carrot with visible roots still present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot possesses a tapered top end with visible small roots protruding or wrapping around it. This is a typical feature observed in carrots, where root hairs often emerge from the top surface, contributing to anchoring in the soil.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Is the carrot still positioned upright in the substrate?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the carrot standing vertically in the substrate, as evidenced by its conical alignment from top to bottom without inclination. The upright position is discerned through the directionality in which the carrot emerges from the soil, maintaining a straight axis.",
    "answer": "Yes"
