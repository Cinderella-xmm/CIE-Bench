    "Question": "Q1: Is the brand name \"Karls\" clearly visible on the label of the jar?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are cartoon illustrations representing popcorn, pumpkins, and other elements related to pumpkin spice. This indicates that there are no jar labels present, which would typically display a brand name. Therefore, there is no evidence of the brand name 'Karls' visible due to the entirely cartoonish and illustrative nature of Image B.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the text \"Pumpkin Spice Popcorn\" present on the label of the jar?",
