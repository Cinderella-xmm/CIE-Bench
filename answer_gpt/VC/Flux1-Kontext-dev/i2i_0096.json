      "question": "Is the sofa still black with multiple cushions evenly arranged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa retains its black color and multiple cushions are visible. Visual cues confirm that the placement of these cushions is still orderly and similar to a typical arrangement. This consistent arrangement reflects world knowledge where cushions are typically symmetrically placed for aesthetic and comfort purposes.",

      "question": "Does the painting above the sofa retain its swirling orange-red vortex design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The painting in Image B continues to display a swirling orange-red vortex design. The colors and swirling pattern are distinctive and are a focal point of the artwork. This is supported by common design elements where abstract paintings often include such pronounced and dynamic patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the painting still hung directly above the sofa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting is shown directly above the sofa, occupying a central position. This positioning is typical of interior decoration where artwork is often hung aligned with the main furniture to create a harmonious visual balance within the space, consistent with common decoration practices.",

      "question": "Is the wall behind the sofa a neutral light color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall in Image B appears to be a light, neutral color, such as white or a very light gray. This is deduced from the bright appearance behind the sofa, typical of modern and minimalist interiors which favor such tones to make spaces appear larger and more open.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, sunlight patterns and shadows are visible on the wall, indicating there is a light source, presumably a window nearby. These shadows and light effects indicate the presence of sunlight, common observational knowledge when interiors have adjacent windows.",
