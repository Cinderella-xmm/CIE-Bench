        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the printed texts on the open pages of the book are clearly visible. The photograph is well-focused, and the lighting conditions enhance the readability of the text, ensuring that each line is distinct and legible. This suggests that the image has been captured or edited to prioritize clarity and sharpness of the text. Therefore, based on the visibility of the text, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Is the book cover still visibly pinkish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the book cover retains the pinkish hue. It contrasts slightly against the wooden background, emphasizing its color. The light conditions and perspective allow the pink shade to be distinct, particularly near the edges of the book where the cover is visible. Thus, based on the color visible at the edges, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden background is clearly visible, showcasing natural texture and grain patterns characteristic of wood surfaces. The lighting and shadow effects help emphasize these features, making the wood look authentic and unchanged. The clarity of the grain patterns is evident under the book, despite its placement. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is visibly open and laid flat on the wooden surface. The pages are aligned logically, maintaining the typical spacing and arrangement seen in open books. This suggests thoughtful arrangement and alignment of the book within the frame, maintaining a natural appearance as it rests on the surface. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Do the pages retain their beige color and slightly aged texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pages of the book show a beige color consistent with aged paper, giving the book an antiquated or vintage feel. This coloration is typical of older books, often resulting from factors like exposure to light and air, which contribute to a yellowed appearance over time. The retained beige color indicates that the editing process has preserved the book's original texture and aging characteristics. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
