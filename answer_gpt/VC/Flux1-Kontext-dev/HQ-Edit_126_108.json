      "question": "Are the two large dark boulders positioned in the foreground grassy area near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two large dark boulders positioned distinctly in the foreground grassy area near the cliff edge. The visual cues show the boulders standing prominently in the grass, providing a natural border or transition from the grassy area to the cliff. This aligns with common landscape features where rocks or boulders are often found near such dramatic geographic formations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a visible dirt path curving through the grass toward the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a dirt path which curves through the grassy foreground toward the cliff edge. This path visually guides the viewer's eye from the foreground into the mid-ground and toward the waterfall, adding depth to the scene. The presence of such a path is common in natural settings where foliage and grass are worn down by repeated traversal.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are tree branches extending from the top-left corner into the frame, casting shadows over the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tree branches noticeably extend from the top-left corner into the frame. These branches cast distinct shadows over the grassy foreground, which is a common occurrence when sunlight filters through foliage. The branches and shadows add to the dimensionality of the image, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow in the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sunlight illuminating the scene from the right side, casting warm golden light on the waterfall and mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B suggests that the sunlight is indeed illuminating the scene from the right side. This is evident from the warm golden light observed on the waterfall and mountains, typically indicative of sunlight either from sunrise or sunset. The direction and quality of light create a dramatic and picturesque effect on the landscape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a wide river flowing across a flat plain above the waterfall, with scattered green islands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wide river is visible, flowing across a relatively flat plain above the waterfall. The river is interspersed with scattered green islands, a typical natural feature in riverine landscapes where sediment deposit or vegetation growth forms small islands. This adds to the dynamic nature of the scene above the waterfalls.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there dark, layered mountains visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows dark, layered mountains in the background, situated underneath a partly cloudy sky. This combination of mountains and sky creates a visual boundary and adds depth to the scene. Knowledge of typical landscape compositions supports the interpretation that such a mountainous backdrop is common in expansive sceneries.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there visible mist rising from the base of the waterfall and diffusing into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, mist can be seen rising from the base of the waterfall and diffusing into the surrounding air. This mist is a natural consequence of water cascading from significant heights and interacting with the air, creating a misty effect commonly associated with powerful waterfalls.",
