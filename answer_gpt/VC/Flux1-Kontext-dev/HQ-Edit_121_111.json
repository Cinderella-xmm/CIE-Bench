      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is depicted in an upright stance but not supported by its hind legs, with its front paws raised toward its mouth. Instead, it is depicted with a whimsical look, having wings and holding a pink acorn, suggesting it is part of a fantastical scene. This is consistent with a tilted body but the hind legs are not visibly supporting it.",
