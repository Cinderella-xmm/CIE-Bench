      "question": "Does the edited image retain the skateboarder's black shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboarder's attire is included as part of a toy figure. The toy is wearing a black shirt, which is consistent with the original skateboarder in Image A who is also wearing a black shirt. This suggests that the black shirt has been retained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model that appears as a figure in the edited image (Image B) shows the skateboarder wearing blue jeans. This is consistent with Image A where the skateboarder is also wearing blue jeans. Thus, the blue jeans have been retained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the skateboard and its position relative to the skateboarder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited version shows a toy box featuring the skateboarder with a skateboard in a similar position relative to the person's pose. The position and orientation of the skateboard with respect to the model are consistent with those seen in Image A. Hence, the skateboard and its position have been retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B showcases the skateboarder in the same dynamic pose that is depicted in Image A. This involves a particular arm and leg positioning indicative of a skating maneuver. Thus, the dynamic pose has been retained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the detailed textures and colors of the skateboarder's attire and skateboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B translates the skateboarder and their attire into a stylized toy form that inherently has less detail and texture than a photograph, the colors of the outfit, such as the black shirt and blue jeans, are consistent. Meanwhile, the skateboard's existence is represented in a simplified form. Thus, the detailed textures are not fully retained in the toy's design, focusing more on a stylistic representation.",
