      "question": "Are both corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes present and positioned at the upper corners of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure within the glass dome has two prominent corner towers that are easily identifiable due to their height and placement. Both towers appear to have domed roofs and have weather vanes visible atop, confirming their presence and location at the upper corners of the structure. This observation aligns with typical architectural features of historical towers, where such corner structures add to visual balance and serve practical purposes like enhanced visibility. Image A shows similar characteristics, substantiating their prominence in both images.",

      "question": "Is the crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower intact and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower design incorporates a crenellated parapet along the rooftop. The detail in the edited image shows an intact and continuous parapet, which is typical in historical architecture for defensive purposes, giving an impression of completeness and symmetry. Image A also presents this feature clearly, which reinforces the edited image's depiction as accurate.",

      "question": "Are the arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade, including the triplet groupings above the main level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a façade with symmetrically placed arched windows, including notable triplet groupings visible above the main level. This arrangement reflects a common architectural style where symmetry is used for aesthetic balance and uniformity. Image A displays this feature consistently, showing similar window patterns that confirm the edited image's accurate representation in preserving this style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a central arched entrance at ground level, directly beneath the central section of the façade, with a wooden drawbridge structure extending forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure within the dome in Image B showcases a central arched entrance located at ground level beneath the central façade. A distinct wooden drawbridge, extending forward and visible in a crisscross pattern, further emphasizes the entrance's grandiosity often found in historic towers for ceremonial or defensive reasons. Image A correlates with this design, affirming the edited image's depiction of the entrance and drawbridge.",

      "question": "Are there horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone visible across the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the external design lacks evident horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone. The stone walls appear uniform in coloration, without contrasting bands that might otherwise contribute to visual depth or distinction. Image A similarly shows a consistent stone color, supporting the conclusion that alternating bands are not present in the architectural depiction.",

      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, rectangular mass with two prominent corner towers projecting outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a tower with a tall, rectangular mass, clearly depicted with two corner towers projecting outward. This structural form is typical in the design of defensive architecture, where corner towers enhance structural integrity and provide vantage points. Image A reaffirms this architectural configuration, indicating continuity and prominence of this design across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drawbridge in Image B features a pronounced crisscross lattice pattern of beams, visible from its design extending from the central entrance. Such construction offers durability and aesthetic appeal, often used in historical architecture. Image A confirms the presence of this specific pattern, consolidating the edited image's accurate representation of the drawbridge.",
