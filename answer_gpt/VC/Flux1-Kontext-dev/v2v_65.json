      "question": "Is the helmet equipped with two curved horns and a central white feather-like adornment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet has two curved horns that are positioned symmetrically on each side, which is a typical design for certain fantasy or medieval helmets. However, upon close examination, there is no visible central white feather-like adornment at the top of the helmet. My reasoning is based on matching the visual description to common helmet styles and combing through the details without spotting the adornment.",

      "question": "Does the character hold a round shield with a central boss and rivets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is holding a shield that is round in shape with a visibly defined central boss, which is a raised part in the middle, and the surface of the shield shows multiple rivets around it. My reasoning is based on identifying the distinct characteristics of shields, particularly those used in various periods of warrior equipment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a sword sheathed at the characterâ€™s back with a visible hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back of the character does show a handle, which suggests a sword hilt, protruding over the shoulder. This is a classic positioning for a sheathed weapon carried by warriors or adventurers, which supports the understanding that the character has a sword on the back.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the shoulder pauldron feature a swirling Norse-inspired engraved pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoulder pauldron in Image B shows detailed engravings, and with familiarity of Norse or Viking motifs, the design indeed reflects swirling patterns common in such styles. This is identified by focusing on the artistic embellishments characteristic of Norse influences.",

      "question": "Does the tunic have fur trim along its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tunic seen on the character in Image B has edges that are lined with fur, an element often used for warmth and decoration in colder climates and historical contexts. This observation considers the specific texture and material appearance described visually.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the armor exhibit a metallic texture or finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor does not exhibit distinct metallic textures or shine but rather shows a more matte finish typical of leather, fur, or other non-metal materials. This conclusion is drawn from interpreting the surface appearance lacking the reflective sheen common to metal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the horns on the helmet curved outward and upward, positioned symmetrically on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The helmet's horns in Image B are curved upward and outward, placed symmetrically on each side of the helmet. This can be inferred from the scene by analyzing the identical design and alignment relative to the central axis of the helmet, a style used in depicting Viking-inspired helmets.",
