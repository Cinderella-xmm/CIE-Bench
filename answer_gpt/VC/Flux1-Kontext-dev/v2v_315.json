      "question": "Does the echidna retain its detailed spines and naturalistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the echidna is depicted with detailed spines, which are sharp and distinct. The overall shape and positioning of the spines are maintained, contributing to a somewhat naturalistic appearance, although the style appears more animated or stylized compared to a purely realistic depiction. This is contrasted with Image A, where the echidna's spines and overall texture appear more refined and realistic in detail. Nonetheless, Image B retains the detailed spines within a stylized context.",

      "question": "Are the warm, golden hues and lighting of the surreal landscape retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains warm and golden hues that suggest a surreal atmosphere similar to Image A. The lighting in Image B remains soft and warm, with a predominantly golden color palette which reflects a desert-like, surrealistic setting. These visual cues indicate that the warm lighting and color scheme have been retained.",

      "question": "Is the echidna still positioned near the girl's feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the echidna is positioned on the ground right next to the girl, near her feet. This placement of the echidna is similar to Image A, where the echidna is also close to the girl's feet, suggesting continuity in positioning across both images.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tall, angular rock formations in the background retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature tall, angular rock formations in the background, contributing to the surreal environment. In Image B, these rock formations are angular and stacked, retaining the characteristic look from Image A, reinforcing the impression of a fantastical or otherworldly landscape.",

      "question": "Does the girl retain her confident pose and overall scene composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl stands with her hands on her hips, legs apart, and a slight forward lean, which conveys a sense of confidence and assertiveness. This posture is very similar to the girl's stance in Image A, where she also exhibits a confident pose. The overall scene composition, with the girl as a central figure interacting with the echidna in a stylized environment, is maintained, pointing to consistency between the two images.",
