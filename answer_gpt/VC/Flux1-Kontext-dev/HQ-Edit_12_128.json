    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the clock face circular and positioned in the center of the wooden frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the clock face is circular and clearly positioned in the center of the frame. World knowledge tells us this is a typical arrangement for wall clocks to ensure symmetry and balance in design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals arranged in clockwise order from I to XII around the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Roman numerals are placed around the circumference of the clock face, logically following the traditional sequence from I to XII in a clockwise fashion. This setup is consistent with standard clock arrangements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pendulum hang directly below the clock face, supported by two vertical rods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pendulum positioned directly below the clock face. It is connected to the clock through a single rod, not two. This understanding is enhanced by common knowledge of pendulum mechanisms in clocks where typically only one rod is used.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two fluted columns, one on each side of the clock face, extending from the top to the bottom of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two columns flanking the clock face do not extend to the very bottom; they appear to support the structure around the clock face primarily at its top half. These columns are fluted, as informed by architectural styles and designs featuring vertical grooves.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a decorative crest with leaf-like carvings located at the top center of the clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a decorative crest with intricate leaf-like carvings centrally positioned at the very top of the clock frame. This decorative element is typical for antique or classical style clocks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a circular medallion located at the center of the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, instead of a circular medallion, the central area of the clock face features ornate designs that are integrated with the hour and minute hands. Common knowledge of clock design suggests medallions are separate entities, making this configuration incompatible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there two small rounded feet extending downward from the bottom corners of the clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any features such as rounded feet extending from the bottom corners. The clock design in Image B slants directly into the wall without additional support at the base. Understanding clock structural norms informs this observation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
