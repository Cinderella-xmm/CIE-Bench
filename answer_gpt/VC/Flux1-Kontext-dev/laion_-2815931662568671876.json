    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tortilla chips appear to be smooth with a cartoon-like appearance, lacking the detailed texture and visible salt crystals that would be expected from a coarse, slightly cracked texture. This suggests that the realistic elements have been replaced with stylized, simplified forms typical of cartoon imagery.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the golden-brown color of the largest tortilla chip preserved, with natural tonal variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coloring of the tortilla chip is uniform with a more illustrative style, lacking the nuanced tonal variation and golden-brown color that would suggest natural lighting and variation. This uniformity aligns with the stylized representation seen in animation or illustration.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chunky, uneven texture of the guacamole mound preserved, showing visible avocado pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the guacamole mound with a realistic chunky texture or visible avocado pieces; instead, it features a character holding an avocado and a mound that appears more like smooth mashed potatoes, lacking detail and texture. This indicates a departure from photorealistic features to a more cartoonish aesthetic.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the green-yellow gradient of the guacamole preserved, showing natural avocado color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors associated with the guacamole and the avocado character are simplified and less gradient-driven, leaning into the solid colors typical in illustrations rather than the natural green-yellow gradient found in mashed avocado. This aligns with a cartoon form rather than a focus on natural color representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the chip and guacamole rendered with realistic material properties, avoiding glossy or plastic-like finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays chips and guacamole with a glossy, plastic-like finish typical of animated scenes, differing from realistic material properties where textures and reflections mimic real-world counterparts. The edited aesthetic focuses on clean lines and simplified visuals, characteristic of animated properties rather than true-to-life representations.",
