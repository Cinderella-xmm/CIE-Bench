      "question": "Is the dancer depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee, while her right foot remains planted on the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is clearly depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee, suggesting a classical pose where one leg is elevated, often seen in dance movements. Her right foot is grounded, providing the necessary support and balance. This stance is common in dance, where one leg is used for motion or pose while the other maintains stability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned on the right side of the image, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is centrally positioned, not leaning towards the right side of the frame. Her body orientation, including the direction her face is turned towards, indicates she is facing forward rather than distinctly to the left. Typically, body alignment and posture are used to discern direction, but here, positioning doesn't strongly suggest she is facing left.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skirt of the dancer appear to be flared outward and upward due to motion, suggesting a spinning or leaping movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is wearing a long white skirt which is flared outward with clear folds and waves, indicating movement. Such outward flaring is typical in dance when spinning or leaping, as centrifugal force causes clothing to billow and extend outward. The skirt's spread suggests dynamic action consistent with dance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, with a group of animals in the midground and trees in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition shows the dancer prominently in the foreground. Behind her, there are animals that appear smaller, indicating they are positioned in the midground. Further back, the trees, rendered with less detail, indicate their background placement, creating depth in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the right side of the image, illuminating the dancer and casting shadows to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting suggests that the source is on the right side, as the dancer's right side is more brightly illuminated compared to the left side. This type of lighting typically results in shadows falling towards the left, which is consistent with the illumination effects observed in the image.",
