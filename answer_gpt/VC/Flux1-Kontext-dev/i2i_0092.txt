    "Question": "Q1: Is the main subject of the new scene (seaside café elements) centrally positioned on the table?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject is the phone resting on its stand. It is positioned near the center of the table, which suggests that the seaside café elements are presented centrally. Given the phone is the focal object, it is positioned in a central location relative to the circular table, making it seem central to the new scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the new scene retain a clean and minimalistic style with no extraneous objects or clutter?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the phone on a stand against the backdrop of a seaside café. The table is clear, except for the phone, stand, and a chair in the background. The setting feels clean and minimalist, focusing on the phone and its stand without additional clutter.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the perspective and composition of the new scene consistent with the original, providing a clear view of the seaside café tabletop?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the view clearly places the phone stand on a round table, with some seaside background visible through a window. The perspective presents a clear focus on the phone and the tabletop, similar to Image A where the phone stand is clearly viewable and central to its composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there distinct sunlight reflections visible on the table surface in the new scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, sunlight reflections are visible both on the table surface and on the stand of the phone. These reflections suggest sunlight is streaming in from the windows, highlighting the objects placed on it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Can you see subtle sea wave reflections in the background or on the table surface in the new scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly displays the seaside view through the windows, but the table surface itself does not have noticeable reflections that resemble sea waves. The reflections are more related to sunlight rather than wave patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
