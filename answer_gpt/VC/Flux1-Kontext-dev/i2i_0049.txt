    "Question": "Q1: Is the large red text 'START' above the skier still visible and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area that would have displayed any text above the skier is filled with solid, bright green, which contrasts with any notion of text visibility. This suggests that any original text content, like 'START', visible in Image A is obscured or replaced entirely in Image B. Thus, the large red text 'START' is not visible and is changed.",
