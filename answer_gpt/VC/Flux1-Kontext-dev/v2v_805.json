      "question": "Is the text \"STORY PAGES\" present in uppercase serif font above the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a crystal ball with text within it. The text 'STORY PAGES' is clearly visible at the top of the sphere, written in uppercase letters. The font used has distinct serif characteristics, identifiable by the small decorative lines at the end of strokes. This aligns with known serif font features, which are often considered to give text a classic or formal appearance.",

      "question": "Does the book have a visible spine and two cover edges forming an open structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an opened book depicted under the text 'STORY PAGES'. The book appears open with two visible cover edges to suggest an open structure. However, there is no visible spine in Image B due to the style of illustration used within a spherical glass, which intentionally omits realistic details like a spine for a more iconic representation.",

      "question": "Are there multiple curved horizontal lines on both left and right sides of the book representing stacked pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the opened book under the text 'STORY PAGES' shows multiple curved horizontal lines on both the left and right pages. These lines are commonly used in illustrations to represent the presence of multiple pages, suggesting a stack of pages typical of an open book.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is depicted within a glass sphere. The book and the text above it appear to be centrally aligned both horizontally and vertically in relation to the sphere. This centering creates a balanced composition and is visually appealing, which is likely the intention within a decorative setting like this.",

      "question": "Is the book and text rendered in dark navy blue on a light beige background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the text and book elements in a dark color within the illuminated scene of the crystal ball. While the exact hue of the dark navy blue is difficult to ascertain due to the glowing effect, it can be inferred from common design use and the original image (which appears rendered in dark navy blue against the light beige of the paper). However, within the context of the glowing sphere, the surrounding environment alters the color perception, but it maintains a dark hue consistent with the design choice in images like the original.",
