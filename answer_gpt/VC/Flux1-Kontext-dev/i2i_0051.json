      "question": "Does the image retain the gesture of both women shaking hands over the tennis net?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show the two women extending their arms in a handshake gesture over the net, signifying the end of a tennis match. This is a common practice in tennis for players to shake hands after a game, and the visual elements such as the posture and positioning of their arms support this interpretation.",

      "question": "Are both women holding tennis rackets in their hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both women are visibly holding tennis rackets. This can be inferred from their posture and the shape of the objects in their other hands, which are consistent with the design of tennis rackets. Each player has a racket, one of which is held upright while the other is more relaxed at the side.",

      "question": "Is the tennis court depicted with green surfaces and white boundary lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis court is not depicted with green surfaces; instead, it has a brownish tone which resembles a clay court. The boundary lines are still visible, typically marked in white, as is common in tennis to mark the playing areas. This color palette is different from a traditional hard court which usually exhibits green surfaces.",

      "question": "Is there a tennis ball visible on the court near the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible tennis ball on the ground of the court. The ground appears clear, without any objects resembling a tennis ball, which is usually noticeably round and of a bright color such as yellow. The absence of such an object suggests that there are no balls on the court surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tennis net is clearly visible between the two women, symbolizing the division of the court into two halves, which is characteristic of tennis courts. The net is an essential component in tennis, used to separate the opponent's sides, and the depiction remains consistent with this setup.",
