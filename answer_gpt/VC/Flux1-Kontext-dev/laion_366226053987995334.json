      "question": "Is the overall shape of each earring a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no earring visible. Instead, the image shows a bird holding an object that somewhat resembles a feather, but it is not an earring. The object has an eye design which doesn't match the description of a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends as described in the question. This depiction in Image B deviates from the concept of an earring with a defined feather shape as described in the question.",

      "question": "Does each earring contain a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is holding an object that resembles a feather or a similar shape, but not an earring as described. The object does not have a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel. Instead, it has an eye-like design with segments resembling parts of the feather and an eye within a circular frame. This indicates a different design from what was originally described in the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there fine, parallel engraved lines extending outward from the central spine on both sides of the feather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object's design held by the bird includes elements that mimic a feather-like structure with what appears to be lines or grooves, suggesting a resemblance. However, these lines are part of a more stylized or abstract design created for the object which is not an earring. The context of the object's design does not fulfill the criterion of being part of an earring. Despite the feather motif, it is altered from its basic representation in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the metal of the earrings rendered in a silver tone with a matte or slightly oxidized (antiqued) finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, since there is no depiction of an earring in the usual sense, but an abstract object being held by a bird, the representation of metal characteristics, such as being silver-toned or having a matte or oxidized finish, is not directly applicable. The object is depicted in a cartoonish style and lacks sophistication of metallic rendering, thereby not fulfilling the criteria for an earring description.",

      "question": "Does each earring include a curved hook earwire connected via a small spherical bead to the main feather body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict earrings; hence, no specific features such as a curved hook earwire or a spherical bead are visible. The object shown is part of a fictional scene involving a bird, and does not include earwires as described in traditional earrings. This abstract representation does not align with the earring component specifications given in the question.",

      "question": "Are the two earrings identical in shape, size, and orientation, mirrored across a vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no earrings depicted, thus making the comparison of identical features or mirroring across a vertical axis impossible. The single object presented does not translate into a pair of earrings to assess symmetry, size, or orientation. This lack of depiction directly implies that the question's criteria about mirroring does not apply.",
