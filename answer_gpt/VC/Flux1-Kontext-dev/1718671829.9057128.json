      "question": "Is there a bench positioned on the left side of the porch, facing inward toward the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the porch includes an object resembling a bench on the left side, oriented to face the interior of the building. The position and orientation are visually identifiable by the representation of a chair-like silhouette with armrests highlighted on the left of the porch. This setup typically implies a seating arrangement positioned outward or toward another directional focal point, confirming the presence and orientation of the bench.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large vertical glass panel or sliding door on the front face of the cabin, emitting warm light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an area on the left side of the cabin which seems to be a vertical opening. The visual depiction lacks distinctive transparency or any indication of light emission. It appears to be solid and decorated, rather than transparent or glass. This representation in the edited image suggests a more opaque structural element rather than a light-emitting glass panel or door.",

      "question": "Is there a bright circular moon located in the upper right portion of the sky, above the distant hills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a circular moon is clearly depicted in the upper right portion of the scene. Its position is above the horizon line, which features a sequence of dark silhouettes that are representative of hills or mountains. The bright quality and position confirm it as a moon.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a porch structure that is supported by several vertical beams visible in the foreground. These beams are integral to the architectural design, providing structural support typical of a porch construction.",

      "question": "Is there visible warm interior lighting emanating from within the cabin through the glass wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear indication of light emanating from within the cabin through a glass wall. The edited image does not show any warm light emission or a glass wall that would allow it to be visible. The colors and details of the porch suggest a nighttime scene with illumination not originating from the porch area.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground features vegetation, but it appears stylized without any explicit depiction of small white blossoms that one would identify as flowers. The emphasis is on the artistic representation rather than botanical accuracy, devoid of detailed blossom characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a line of dark shapes at the horizon, which can visually be interpreted as silhouettes of hills or mountains. These features are typical of landscapes and positioned below the moon, creating a natural scene that is consistent with typical visual depiction of distant terrains at night.",
