    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the silhouetted tree branches in the foreground clearly visible and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of tree branches are visible in the foreground. However, due to the altered presence of the dragon and overall image editing, these branches do not appear to retain the exact same shapes and positions as might be expected from a natural scene without added elements. World knowledge indicates that digitally manipulated images often adjust foreground elements to integrate new objects effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small green hilltop with sparse vegetation visible just above the mist layer in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a scene dominated by the large dragon built into the mountain, altering the landscape depiction. The hilltop with sparse vegetation is not visibly discernible above the mist layer, primarily because the dragon feature changes the landscape, affecting visibility of specific details previously present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky retain its original gradient from deep blue at the top to soft pink and lavender near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky maintains a gradient effect with a mix of colors transitioning from deeper blues to softer pinks and lavenders near the horizon. The visual cues, combined with world knowledge about atmospheric perspectives, suggest that these color transitions remain largely unchanged even after significant edits like the addition of the dragon.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous layer of mist or fog extending horizontally beneath the mountain, obscuring its lower slopes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a layer of mist that extends across the scene beneath the dragon-themed mountain formation. This horizontal layer of fog obscures the lower slopes of the digital mountain, which is a common effect seen in natural and edited scenic representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground trees, mid-ground hill, and background mountain arranged in their original relative positions, maintaining the depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B significantly alters the original composition with the dragon mountain dominating the scene and changing the relative positions of scenic elementsâ€”foreground trees, any previous mid-ground hill, and the background mountain. Thus, the original depth and arrangement are not retained, even visually.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the tree branches retain their original fine details, including individual twigs and leaf clusters, in silhouette form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouetted tree branches in Image B maintain details, but not necessarily the exact fine details of individual twigs and leaf clusters as might have been present initially. The presence of dramatic elements like the dragon can overshadow such details, altering the perceived precision of the silhouettes based on the visual scene manipulation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the peak of the mountain still positioned at the highest point in the scene, serving as the central focal point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central focal point shifts to the dragon's head and overall form positioned atop the digital mountain structure, making it the highest point in the scene. This design alters the previous focal point and elevates the dragon's placement as central to the new composition.",
