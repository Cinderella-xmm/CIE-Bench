        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon drawing depicting two characters in tennis attire, so there are no sheep shown. The cartoon style typically doesn't include natural wool textures, which are evident in Image A where the sheep's curly and fluffy appearance is visible. Thus, there is no depiction of sheep in Image B to retain any natural attributes, including wool texture.",
