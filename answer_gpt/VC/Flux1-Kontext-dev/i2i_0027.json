      "question": "Is the dog's pose still focused on the tennis ball, with the ball near its nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is sitting on a green mat and holding the tennis ball. The pose is different from a focused stare with the ball near its nose as seen in Image A, but rather playful and attentive. The ball is in contact with the dog's paws rather than its nose, indicating a more playful posture than obsessive focus.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is depicted with a consistent green color and a prominent pink stripe. This color scheme matches the description provided, indicating no alteration in the color attributes of the tennis ball compared to Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dog still depicted as observing or interacting with the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is clearly interacting with the tennis ball as it is holding it with its paws and sitting attentively, suggesting a playful engagement. The dog's large eyes and focused posture indicate active engagement and curiosity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dog's posture still reflect a prone, ball-focused position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted in a sitting position rather than a prone one. Sitting suggests alertness but not the same level of focus as lying down near the ball. The posture conveys attentiveness but not a prone, focused position as seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball looks smooth and artistically rendered, suggesting a more stylized and less realistic representation compared to the felt texture evident in Image A. While the color is consistent, the texture is simplified and less tactile in Image B.",
