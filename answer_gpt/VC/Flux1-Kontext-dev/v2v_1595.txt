    "Question": "Q1: Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball appears with yellow panels and black pentagonal panels. However, the image appears stylized, possibly altering the panel count or configuration. The original ball in Image A clearly retains the standard number of panels configured typically for a soccer ball. Based on common knowledge and the artistic depiction style of Image B, the panel count is likely altered or unverified.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a cartoonish pop-art style that emphasizes bold lines and flat coloration that generally doesn't represent depth in a realistic way. In contrast, Image A shows a realistic depiction of a three-dimensional sphere. Image B likely does not depict the soccer ball as three-dimensional due to the artistic style.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a goalpost that, despite being stylized with bright colors and bold lines, maintains a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar akin to standard goal shapes. Based on visual cues and knowledge of typical goalpost structures, it seems to retain its standard configuration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the net of the goalpost composed of a visible grid pattern of intersecting lines forming square or rectangular cells?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the net is depicted as having intersecting lines forming a grid pattern. This representation aligns with common perceptions of a soccer goal net, even in its stylized form. Image A similarly depicts a grid pattern of intersecting lines, confirming this attribute in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the soccer ball positioned in the foreground, in front of the goalpost, with part of the goal visible behind it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is clearly situated in front of the goalpost, indicating its placement in the foreground with the goal behind it. This setup is a typical composition for images depicting soccer themes. Image A shows similar positioning, confirming consistent layout across both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the seams between the black and white panels of the soccer ball clearly visible and aligned with the edges of the pentagons and hexagons?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a stylized design where defining seams may be obscured or altered given the heavy artistic influence. In Image A, the seams are clearly visible and align with the panel edges. However, Image B's pop-art style likely modifies or simplifies this feature, making seams less defined.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the soccer ball centered in the foreground and the goalpost positioned directly behind it in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is placed centrally within the composition, with the goalpost directly behind it, suggesting consistency with typical foreground-background alignment in such images. Image A reflects similar placement, showing congruence in layout between edited and original images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
