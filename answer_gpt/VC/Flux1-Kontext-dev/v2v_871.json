      "question": "Is the bite mark present on the right side of the pear-shaped animal, exposing white flesh with an irregular edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a pear with a noticeable bite mark on the right side. The bite has exposed the inner white flesh, and the edges of the bite are irregular, suggesting a natural bite. Typically, when a pear is bitten, the flesh underneath is revealed, and the irregularity of the bite mark is typical due to the uneven pressure exerted during the bite.",

      "question": "Does the interior surface of the glass cube display a visible wood grain pattern with a warm brown color matching the original wooden backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior surface of the glass cube displays a clear wood grain pattern. This pattern is visible as lines across the wooden base, and the warm brown color complements the pear's wooden backdrop, which is consistent with the natural warm tones often seen in wooden textures. Upon examining Image A, the same warm brown wooden surface is evident.",

      "question": "Does the pear-shaped animal retain the small brown speckles across its outer surface, mimicking the original pear’s skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pear-shaped object still adorned with small brown speckles across its surface. These speckles are detailed and mimic the texture commonly found on the skin of real pears. Multiplying elements like speckles can help identify specific fruits like pears because of their distinctive patterns; they can give indication about the fruit's type. Image A demonstrates the same speckled texture.",

      "question": "Is a brown stem present at the top of the pear-shaped animal, extending upward from the narrow end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pear-shaped object features a brown stem protruding upwards from its narrow end. The presence of a stem is typical for fruits like pears as it connects the fruit to the tree and is located traditionally at the narrower end of the pear. The stem is visible as a defining characteristic of pears in Image A as well.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the pear-shaped animal maintain the classic teardrop silhouette with a narrow neck and broad base, matching the original pear’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals the pear-shaped object has retained the classic teardrop silhouette that pears are known for, with a broad base tapering to a narrower neck. This shape is natural to pears and helps distinguish them from other fruit shapes. Image A portrays the same teardrop silhouette typical of pears.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features lighting with warm tones, exhibiting golden-brown highlights and soft shadows. Such lighting fits with the color palette typically seen in cozy and natural settings, emphasizing warmth and homeliness. When comparing to Image A, these warm tones are consistent, presenting both image environments as having similar lighting conditions.",
