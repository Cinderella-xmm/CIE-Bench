      "question": "Is the radish character’s body still a white oval with a pointed bottom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has the body of a radish, which is visually represented as a white oval with a pointed bottom. This shape is characteristic of a radish and aligns with common depictions of this vegetable in art forms. The white color and the tapering shape convey the typical appearance of a radish, indicating that the character maintains its original form in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are there exactly three green leafy sprouts growing from the top of the radish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the radish character indeed has green leafy sprouts emerging from the top. Counting these, there are exactly three individual sprouts. This matches well with the conventional idea of leafy greens sprouting from a radish, and thus, the depiction maintains the typical three-sprout appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the radish character include two small black circular eyes, a simple curved smile on its face, and two distinct pink blush marks on its cheeks. These cartoonish features are present and clearly visible, retaining the character’s original charming expression.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the radish character is wearing a frilly tutu, identifiable by its texture and form around the character's midsection. The tutu maintains a pink hue, providing a consistent and innocent whimsical style associated with the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, a red leash extends visibly from the radish character’s right hand, connecting to the collar of the dog. The leash is depicted as a continuous line with an unbroken connection between the two characters, reinforcing their interaction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog appears to have a light brown body, which matches the previous image depiction. However, the dog is now wearing a blue sweater instead of just a red collar, and there are no darker brown ears and tail tip visible, distinguishing its appearance from the original specifications for this question.",

      "question": "Are the sidewalk tiles still visible as large rectangular shapes with grout lines, even if partially covered in snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is different: the ground is entirely covered with snow, with no concrete tiles or grout lines visible. The snowy environment suggests a shift from the earlier sidewalk setting, where rectangular tiles were clear. All visual cues of the sidewalk have been obscured by the snow.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the radish positioned ahead of the dog, with both characters moving forward along the sidewalk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, it is observed that the radish and the dog are both walking in a snowy landscape rather than a sidewalk. The positioning has the dog leading, with the radish character slightly behind, walking parallel rather than ahead. This refutes the radish being positioned ahead of the dog and indicates they are moving in harmony within the winter setting.",
