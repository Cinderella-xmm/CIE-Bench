      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust of the pie slice present with visible crumbly texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration labeled 'Solo fise' represents a slice of pie. The crust depicted is brownish-yellow and visibly crumbly, suggesting a texture similar to a homemade crumbly crust. This conclusion is drawn from the common visual characteristics of a pie crust illustrated in cartoons or animated images, which often emphasize texture for clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark purple-blue berry filling with visible burst spots present in the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon-style illustration of a pie slice labeled 'Solo fise' with a filling that appears dark purple-blue. The illustration emphasizes the berries and uses color and shading to suggest fullness and texture similar to berries that might burst during baking, which is a typical trait of berry fillings.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Solo fise' includes a visible green leaf placed on top of the pie slice. This matches the common culinary practice of adding a mint leaf for garnish, enhancing visual appeal and possibly suggesting flavor elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pie slice served on a white circular ceramic plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the pie slice on a circular plate depicted in a simplified manner consistent with cartoon-style images. The plate is a light blue, not white, which differentiates it from usual ceramic plate color assumptions but matches the style of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Tea Miug' shows a mug with its handle on the right side and a string hanging over the rim, which is commonly how a tea bag is illustrated to suggest tea steeping. This is in line with typical mug representations in such graphic styles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide background details suggestive of a specific tabletop surface. Instead, it focuses on individual items without environmental context that would describe texture, color, or material of a tabletop usually depicted in plain backgrounds typical of illustrated infographics.",
