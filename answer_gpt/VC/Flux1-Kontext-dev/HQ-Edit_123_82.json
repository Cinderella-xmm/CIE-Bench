        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman's hair appears as a short straight bob that neatly frames where her face is blurred.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in the edited image is wearing a sleeveless dress that appears to have a bright red color. The texture visible on the dress resembles that of a knitted or crocheted fabric, with an apparent pattern typical in crafted textiles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly wings in the edited image show a clear color pattern where the center of the wings has a blue shade, the borders are brown, and there are orange accents at the tips.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman's hands are positioned in front of her chest in a way that suggests she might be in a restful or posing stance. However, the fingers do not appear interlocked; instead, her fingers are brought together in a prayer-like pose rather than being interwoven.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a strap that crosses her body diagonally from what would be her right shoulder to her left hip, which is a common way to wear a crossbody bag or purse. The strap looks light in color compared to the rest of her outfit, providing contrast.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman’s fingernails in the edited image are painted with a solid, vivid red color. Red nail polish is often used to stand out or match with garments, and here it complements the red dress she's wearing.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the woman’s face is intentionally blurred in the edited image, specific features like a smile, lipstick, or dark eyes are not discernible. This prevents any accurate assessment of her facial expression or makeup detail.",
