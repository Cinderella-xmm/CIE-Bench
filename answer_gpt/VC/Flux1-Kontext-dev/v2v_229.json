      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bed is depicted prominently in the center of the image, marked with clear outlines, colored using sections with bold lines. This representation signifies that the bed is still the central object, comparable to Image A, where the bed is also central but shown with more realistic textures and depth. The essence of the object as a bed remains consistent in both images.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the warm glow from the lamp and candles?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements resembling a lamp and candles are presented with simplified outlines and bright colors like yellow and orange, signifying light sources. This mirrors the concept in Image A, where the warm glow from a lamp and candles is achieved through a realistic play of light and shadows. While the execution differs, Image B still represents the essence of ambient lighting using a color palette reminiscent of warmth.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the soft texture representation of the bedding?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies the depiction of bedding by using bold outlines and flat colors, which do not explicitly convey texture. In Image A, soft textures are highlighted using detailed visual cues like shadows and subtle textural nuances. Therefore, the impression of softness from textures in Image A is not retained in the graphic, texture-less representation of Image B.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the arrangement of pillows on the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the pillows are arranged similarly on the bed. Image B uses bold outlines and distinct sections to indicate multiple pillows arranged across the top of the bed, echoing the arrangement seen in Image A, although with simplified visuals. This reflects a consistency in pillow arrangement, despite the change in artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the position of the bedside table relative to the bed?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedside table is shown as a simplified shape placed to the left of the bed, which parallels the positioning of the bedside table in Image A, creating a spatial relationship that remains consistent across both portrayals. The simplified depiction in Image B maintains the table's relative positioning to the bed seen in the more detailed Image A.",
