    "Question": "Q1: Does the cake retain its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe a cake with a cross-sectional view showing two layers of dark chocolate sponge. This structure is maintained as per the standard design of a layered cake, where filling separates each layer. The layers are clear and distinct, which indicates the cake retains its original layered construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the top of the cake covered in a glossy, reflective chocolate glaze?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, when observing the top of the cake, a smooth and shiny chocolate glaze can be seen covering it. This glossy appearance indicates the glaze has a reflective property, consistent with what is expected of a well-applied chocolate glaze.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there three visible streams of chocolate glaze dripping down the front face of the cake?",
    "explanation": "The visual in Image B clearly shows three streams of chocolate glaze that have dripped down the side of the cake. These drips are quite distinct and evident, indicating the presence of more than one stream.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the cake layers exhibit a dark brown, moist, and porous sponge texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cake layers display a dark brown hue and appear to have a porous texture, as evidenced by the small holes and overall spongy appearance typical of a cake sponge. This texture suggests the cake would be moist, aligning with expectations for a chocolate cake.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the cake placed on a white circular plate?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cake resting on what appears to be a flat, white circular plate. The simplicity and color of the plate are clearly visible and match the expectation of a typical serving plate for a slice of cake.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the cake maintain its triangular cross-sectional shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is viewed from the side, showing a triangular cross-section. This shape is characteristic of a traditionally cut slice of cake, where the base is the widest part and tapers to a point at the top, confirming consistency in shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
