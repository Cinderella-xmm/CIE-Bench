    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the wide open mouth with visible white teeth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visible part of the object reveals no features resembling a mouth with teeth. The edited image shows puzzle pieces that don't convey the presence of a mouth or teeth, unlike Image A which clearly has these features.
