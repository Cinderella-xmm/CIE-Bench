    "Question": "Q1: Does the robot still have two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot within the globe possesses two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head. These antennae are visible and clearly form part of the robot's design. The spherical nature of the globe does not obscure these features, allowing them to be seen distinctly. This observation is similar to the robot's depiction in Image A, where the antennae are also prominent. The presence of these antennae aligns with typical depictions of robotic designs in media, often used to suggest communication features or added sensory capabilities.",
    "answer": "Yes"
