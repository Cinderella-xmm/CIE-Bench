    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the octopus has multiple tentacles extending outward. Counting each tentacle visible in the image reveals that there are precisely eight, which is common as octopuses typically have eight tentacles. The visual cues, like the arrangement and the depiction of each tentacle, clearly indicate this number.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two distinct, large eyes visible on the octopus’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The octopus in the edited image has a distinct head where two large, round eyes are prominently visible, positioned symmetrically on its body. This characteristic matches the typical representation of octopuses in illustrations where their eyes are emphasized to convey personality or emotion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are suction cups visible along the underside of at least some of the octopus’s tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the tentacles of the octopus depict details such as rounded shapes along their length, suggesting they are suction cups. Even though the illustration style is more cartoon-like, these details are consistent with the common depiction of octopus tentacles which feature suction cups.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the octopus positioned on or adjacent to the beach, with part of its body in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the octopus positioned on the shore next to the water, with its body adjacent to the beach. Palm trees and waves indicate this setting is part of a beach location, typical for octopus habitats near water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image emphasizes the octopus as the central and most prominent figure, with it facing towards the viewer, suggesting engagement or interaction. Its positioning in the center and size in comparison to the surrounding elements highlight its importance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a stretch of sandy beach is represented in the foreground meeting the ocean water, complete with waves and indications of sand texture. This detail sets the scene for a coastal environment typical for this illustration style.",
