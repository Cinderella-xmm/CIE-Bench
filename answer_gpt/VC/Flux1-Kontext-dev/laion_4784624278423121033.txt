    "Question": "Q1: Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the atomic design in the central image retains three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus, similar to an atomic model with electron positions around it. This is evident from the consistent atomic shape in all the depictions of cookies and cutters displaying three loops intersecting at a central point, indicating the nucleus.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
    "explanation": "Image B does show plastic cookie cutters, but they are not white; they are colored, representing different parts of an atomic structure. The concept of three elliptical loops around a central nucleus appears consistent across these models and is retained.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, multiple cookie cutters are depicted, illustrated to demonstrate various atomic components with no physical positioning or overlapping with dough as in Image A. Instead, they are shown separately but alongside their imprints to explain their function in the educational context.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see a representation of an atomic imprint shown as part of an illustrated guide, with smooth and consistent edges in the focused example image. The illustration here serves to represent the clean edges seen in a well-formed imprint.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
    "explanation": "The central nucleus in the atomic design shown in Image B's guide illustration has a central feature symbolized by a heart shape cut-out as opposed to a traditional hole, used to reflect an educational emphasis on components like protons, electrons, or neutrons, rather than a specific physical dough impression.",
    "answer": "No"
