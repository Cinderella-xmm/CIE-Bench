        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each chibi-style sticker features a small character depicted in a consistent outfit. The visual elements show that the character in all stickers is wearing a white lab coat, which is common attire for someone in a scientific or medical role.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style stickers in Image B consistently show the subject with a white lab coat, and beneath it, a glimpse of a light blue shirt can be seen. This repeated visual element suggests that the subject is adorned in this shirt in each depiction. Given the uniformity in character design, it is reasonable to conclude that the light blue shirt is visible in all stickers.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the character in each sticker has a uniform appearance, featuring short, brown hair. This characteristic is consistent across all the stickers, seen as a common design choice for depicting the subject in these chibi-style depictions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In reviewing the visual elements in Image B, notably the chibi-style representations, it can be observed that none of the stickers depict the subject with a beard. Instead, the subject is characterized by a clean-shaven or youthful appearance without facial hair, indicating the absence of a beard in these representations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features six chibi-style stickers, each showing subjects involved with scientific activities. Upon examination, it is clear that at least four stickers prominently feature scientific props: the top left and top center stickers include beakers, the top right includes a clipboard, and the bottom right showcases a microscope. These elements serve as clear indicators of the scientific context within the stickers.",
