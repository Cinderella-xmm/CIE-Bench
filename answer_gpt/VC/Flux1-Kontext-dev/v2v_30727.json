      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black and white stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is clearly visible with its characteristic black and white stripe pattern. Zebras are known for their distinctive stripes, which are a key feature of their identity. The pattern on the zebra in Image B appears consistent with this description, as the stripes run parallel and in a typical manner along the body and legs.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's body structure, including its legs and torso, intact?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body structure of the zebra, including its legs and torso, appears normal and complete. This can be judged by the visible shape and posture of the zebra, which matches the common stance of zebras in their natural environment. It is standing beside a watering hole, as one would expect from a live zebra, reinforcing its intact body structure.",

      "question": "Is the watering hole still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a zebra near a body of water which appears to be a watering hole. The water is discernible at the bottom right corner, confirming the presence of a natural water source where animals, such as zebras, often drink.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment includes rocks and dry earth, which form the background and surroundings typical of a zebra's habitat. These elements can be observed around the zebra, maintaining the desert or savanna-like setting from the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although partially obscured by the person added in the edit, the zebra's tail can be seen in a natural position. Zebras typically have tails with a tufted end that hangs down, which is consistent with what is observed in the image.",
