      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the classical archway with ornate carvings present and maintaining its original shape and position in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a plush toy pigeon surrounded by sandcastle structures, which does not feature any classical architectural elements like an archway. The absence of such elements indicates a different context from the classical designs in Image A. Therefore, the classical archway is not present in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the Corinthian column capital with acanthus leaf detailing visible and correctly positioned beneath the spherical perch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any architectural elements typically associated with Corinthian columns, such as acanthus leaf detailing. Instead, the image features sandcastle structures and a plush toy pigeon, which differ significantly from the original design motifs. Thus, the Corinthian column capital is not visible or positioned similarly in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the perch located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital, maintaining its original vertical alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no architectural perch or column capital present. Instead, the setup involves sandcastles and a plush toy pigeon, not resembling any classical architecture alignment. Therefore, the perch is not located directly on top of the Corinthian column capital in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tall fluted column on the left and the distant spired buildings visible in their original positions and silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene consists of a plush toy pigeon with sandcastle structures, lacking any tall fluted columns or distant buildings like those in Image A. These elements are replaced by castle-like decorations fitting the toy theme, differing in both shape and location.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky depicted as bright blue with scattered white cumulus clouds, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an indoor scene with shelves, a plush toy, and sandcastles, without any sky or cloud features. This contrasts with Image A, where the sky is vividly depicted. Therefore, the sky is not depicted similarly in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the floral and scroll carvings on the arch and column frame present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any architectural features such as floral and scroll carvings. It instead focuses on a plush toy and decorative items that do not include architectural carvings. Hence, these details are not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the pigeon oriented sideways with its head turned slightly toward the viewer, maintaining its original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy pigeon is facing forward directly towards the viewer, unlike the sideways orientation of the real pigeon in Image A. The posture is not maintained as in the original image, which had a more naturalistic orientation.",
