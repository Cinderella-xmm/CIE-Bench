    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed sculpture retain a central tall spire flanked by multiple smaller turrets arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a central tall spire surrounded by smaller turrets, indicating a symmetrical arrangement similar to architectural styles found in traditional castles. The visual symmetry suggests a deliberate design choice often seen in artistic representations to evoke grandeur and coherence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small red flags positioned at the tip of each turret of the crystal sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there are no visual indicators of red flags at the tips of the crystal turrets. In the context of crystalline structures, these details are often replaced with transparent or iridescent accents to maintain aesthetic harmony.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shovel located in the foreground, angled toward the base of the castle, and partially submerged in reflective water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel does not appear. It is replaced by a pristine platform holding the crystal sculpture, suggesting a modification where typical beach elements are removed for a more minimalistic display.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gemstones (replacing seashells) grouped in a cluster at the foot of the crystal castle, similar to the original shell arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a cluster of gemstones or any equivalent at the base of the castle. The display focuses on the castle itself without additional decorative elements, suggesting a shift toward simplicity in presentation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the frosted glass slab feature a continuous horizontal wave pattern that mimics the original oceanâ€™s rolling motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background lacks any wave pattern akin to the ocean seen in Image A. Instead, the glass has a simple, light design which does not replicate the motion of rolling waves, suggesting a transition from natural to abstract representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located centrally within the crystal sculpture, rising above all other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the central tall spire as the most prominent feature in the sculpture, rising above surrounding structures. This design choice mirrors architectural hierarchies seen in historical and imaginative castle designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the shovel retain a red blade and yellow handle, even if rendered in crystal or another material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shovel is absent in Image B, indicating it was removed in the sculpture transformation. The focus shifts from beach-themed accessories to sculptural purity, removing elements that are incongruent with the crystal aesthetic.",
