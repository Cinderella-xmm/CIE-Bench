    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's arrangement of six wheels over three axles is clearly visible. This is a typical setup for large trucks, where the front axle is near the cab for steering, and two rear axles support the weight of the cargo body, enhancing stability. The visual appearance of these wheels includes the distinct tread and spacing which matches the description. This indicates that Image B retains this structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cargo body is maintained directly behind the cab, aligning horizontally. This alignment is common in vehicular design for optimal balance and aerodynamics. Comparing it with Image A, the cargo body in both images appears to take the same relative space and positioning directly behind the cab, confirming proportional maintenance.",

      "question": "Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two rectangular windows can be identified on the cargo body. These windows are positioned along the length such that one is situated roughly at one-third of the way down and the other two-thirds down the side of the cargo body. This arrangement supports standard designs for ventilation and lighting in cargo vehicles. The positioning remains consistent with Image A.",

      "question": "Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a vertical slatted grille is visible at the front of the vehicle, found between the headlights and maintaining alignment with the hood, contributing to the truck’s cooling system and aesthetic front-facing design. This is a design element seen in many vintage and classic trucks, providing ventilation and a distinctive look. The configuration remains consistent with Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a side mirror attached to the driver’s side door, extending outward from the upper portion of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the driver’s side door in Image B, there is a lack of a visible side mirror extending outward from the upper portion. This visual cue is a standard feature for rearward visibility but is missing here, contrasting with Image A where such a mirror might be present.",

      "question": "Is there a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body, running parallel to the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual inspection of the lower side of the cargo body shows no presence of a horizontal ladder affixed parallel to the ground. Such a ladder, if present, would assist in accessing higher points of the vehicle, yet it appears to be absent in this edited depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of the driver’s side door in Image B shows no visible silver-colored door handle midway down the door. The absence of this element suggests a deviation from standard automotive door design, where a handle is typically used for entry. Compared to Image A, where a door handle might be expected, it is clearly absent in the edited image.",
