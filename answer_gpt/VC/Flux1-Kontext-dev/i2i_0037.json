        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheesecake appears to maintain its original triangular shape and creamy texture.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both whipped cream piled next to the cheesecake and banana slices placed on the plate, identical to what is seen in Image A. These elements are significant features of the dessert presentation, which have been retained in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape of the plate in Image B appears to still be oval, resembling what is commonly used for serving food items like cheesecake. The color remains white in both images, as evidenced by the visual cues in Image B that match those in Image A.",
