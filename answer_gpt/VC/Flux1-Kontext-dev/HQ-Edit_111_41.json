      "question": "Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the chair is clearly composed of a central column with radiating legs that terminate in casters. They are evenly spaced and are typical of a five-star office chair design. Observing the layout and symmetry, I can determine that there are indeed five legs. This is consistent with the common structure of office chairs which supports stability and ease of movement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a separate headrest cushion positioned directly above the main backrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visibly distinct section at the top of the chair which appears slightly protruded or separated from the rest of the backrest. This section resembles a headrest both in shape and positioning, which is above the main continuous part of the backrest, suggesting it's not part of the main backrest. This design is typical for modern office chairs aimed at providing neck support.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side, extending horizontally from the chairâ€™s midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two identical structures on either side of the chair. They start from the midsection of the chair and extend outward horizontally, serving as supports for the user's arms. This kind of design is quite standard for office chairs, aiming to provide comfort and support.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the backrest vertically aligned behind the seat, rising from the same central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest is positioned directly behind the seat in a straight vertical alignment. The attachment point at the base central axis ensures that the backrest is not offset but rather follows the same line as the seat, providing a typical ergonomic design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chair maintain a tall, high-back silhouette with the headrest significantly higher than the seat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a structure where the backrest extends upwards significantly beyond the seat level, culminating in the headrest, giving it a tall silhouette. This is indicative of a high-back chair that supports the user's upper back and neck.",
