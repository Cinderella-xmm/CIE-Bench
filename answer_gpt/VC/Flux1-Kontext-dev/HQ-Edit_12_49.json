    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the baroque-style scrollwork and acanthus leaf motifs present and accurately reproduced in the same positions and forms as in the original clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch's packaging design reflects a simplified version of the original clock's decorative elements rather than a direct reproduction of the baroque-style scrollwork and acanthus leaf motifs visible in Image A. The motifs on the clock frame are intricate and prominently featured, while the detailing on the packaging is more subdued and does not offer the same complexity or placement. This indicates that while the essence of such designs may be incorporated in Image B, they are not accurately reproduced in the same positions and forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the symmetrical arrangement of the top and bottom finials and side scrollwork preserved exactly as in the original clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a watch within a jewelry box, and while it may contain design elements inspired by the original clock, the symmetrical arrangement seen in Image A—such as finials and side scrollwork—is absent. These elements are part of the clock's ornate frame, which is not directly carried over to the watch packaging design, suggesting a deviation in preservation.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rich mahogany tone and visible wood grain texture of the frame preserved in the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the packaging with a rich mahogany tone and visible wood grain texture that reminds one of the warm color palette and material observed in Image A's clock frame. The jewelry box in Image B appears to align in terms of tone and grain pattern with what could be assumed from Image A’s frame, indicating preservation.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the distressed gold finish of the clock face preserved in the watch face within the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face does reflect the appearance of distress in the gold finish—alluding to Image A's clock face. The continuity of the finish suggests an attempt to maintain that aged and historical appearance, as seen in the clock face, within the watch design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black Roman numerals (I–XII) present in the same positions and style as in the original clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a watch face that features black Roman numerals positioned similarly to Image A's clock face. The numerical style and arrangement appear consistent across both images, indicating preservation of these elements in the transition from clock to watch.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"2010\" and \"2012\" present in the same positions on the clock/watch face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the watch with the inscriptions '2010' and '2012' in corresponding positions to the clock face in Image A. The top and bottom placements of these inscriptions on the watch mimic their positioning on the clock face, maintaining consistency between the two designs.",
