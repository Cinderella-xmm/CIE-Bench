      "question": "Does the edited image retain the alternating tan and dark brown pattern on the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle, now part of a stylized character, retains an alternating tan and dark brown pattern on its shell, mimicking the natural pattern observed in real turtles. The edited image artistically reproduces the shell pattern found in Image A, which helps identify the character as a turtle by using cartoonish representations of real-world turtle shell textures.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's limb structure, even if the limbs are stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle appears to have stylized limbs with distinct segments that mimic the natural structure, maintaining a recognizable form even though they are simplified into a cartoon style. This mirrors Image A, where the turtle's limbs are reptilian with visible segments.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the textured appearance of the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the turtle's shell without the detailed, rough texture seen in Image A, as it uses a smoother, more polished cartoon rendering style. This shift from texture to smoothness in cartoon-style artwork is typical when aiming for simplification while retaining key characteristics like color and shape.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's head structure, including its visible eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B keeps the basic structure of the turtle's head as seen in Image A, including the presence of visible eyes. Although stylized, the cartoon turtle in Image B maintains features like a prominent head and large, expressive eyes, which are signature marks of turtle anatomy, making it traditionally recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the turtle's limbs have been smoothed and lack the detailed texturing found in Image A. This is characteristic of cartoon stylization, where real-world textures are often omitted for clean lines and simplified presentation. Thus, Image B presents limbs that are streamlined compared to the original.",
