      "question": "Are the Colosseum and Big Ben still recognizable as iconic symbols within the snow globe design?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the Colosseum and Big Ben are clearly depicted inside the snow globe. The shapes, architectural features, and details that are traditionally associated with these landmarks are still present and identifiable. The Colosseum is depicted with its iconic structure of arches and tiers, while Big Ben is recognizable by its clock face and tower. These elements make them standout symbols of Rome and London, respectively, making them recognizable despite being in a different artistic context.",

      "question": "Do the shapes and details of the Colosseum and Big Ben remain intact within the snow globe depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B depicts the landmarks with their notable features intact. The Colosseum maintains its series of arches and textures resembling its historic ruin structure, and Big Ben retains its distinct clock face and tower with its pointed apex. The detailed architectural representation allows them to maintain their historic integrity even within the confines of the snow globe.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cup and saucer are visible, acting as the base for the snow globe. The original white saucer is still identifiable as it serves as the globe's foundation, showing continuity from the original setting in Image A where the cups and saucers were separate but integral parts of the visual composition.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden table surface is visible and forms the background upon which the white cup and saucer holding the snow globe rests. The warm brown tone of the table is consistent with the table surface visible in Image A, thereby maintaining the setting in which this creative depiction is presented.",

      "question": "Are the brown tones of the latte art preserved in the snow globe design?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme shifts to a snowy, neutral palette primarily composed of white and light brown to mimic a snow globe effect, differing from the distinct brown tones of the latte art in Image A. While the structures themselves remain visually detailed, the overall color treatment in the edited image does not preserve the brown tones as vividly as the latte art did.",
