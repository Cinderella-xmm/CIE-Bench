      "question": "Is the owl perched on a moss-covered branch with visible green moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl appears digitally illustrated and is perched on a branch. However, the branch is depicted with a digital artistic style that includes glowing blue elements instead of a realistic representation of moss or texture as you would find in nature. In this imaginative context, the green moss texture is not visibly present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small green plant with slender leaves growing next to the owl’s left side on the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, which is artistically rendered, there are glowing blue elements on the branch near the owl rather than natural green or slender leaves. The details are stylistic, with glowing plant-like structures, but actual green plants with slender leaves typical of a real branch setting are not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of dark, out-of-focus green foliage typical of a forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is digitally created, showing a dark, fantasy-inspired environment, primarily composed of blues and greens, suggesting a forest-like setting. It uses an illustrative style that is not out-of-focus but rather part of the digital artwork. This portrays a magical forest feel, although not typically natural.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the owl facing directly toward the camera with a slight head tilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl in Image B, which is digitally drawn, is facing directly towards the viewer with both eyes positioned at the same level, conveying a straightforward gaze. There is no visible tilt of the head in the illustration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the branch have a rough, textured surface covered in green moss with visible patches and crevices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the branch is present, it does not have a realistic rough, textured surface covered in green moss. Instead, it features an imaginative design with glowing blue elements and lacks natural texture that would include mossy patches and crevices.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting dim and natural, with subtle highlights on the owl’s feathers and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is part of the digital and imaginative style which includes bright luminous elements and glowing effects rather than a naturalistic, dim light setting. Highlights are more pronounced and stylized on the owl's features to fit the artistic theme.",
