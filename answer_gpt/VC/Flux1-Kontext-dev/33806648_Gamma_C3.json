      "question": "Is the fallen log still present in the foreground, lying diagonally across the cave floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fallen log is still visible in the foreground, laying diagonally across the cave floor. This observation is based on the visual cue of an elongated, narrow object crossing through the rocky surface area that matches the typical appearance of a log in color and texture. The presence of the log matches Image A, confirming that no changes were made to this element in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does sunlight still enter from the arch opening and illuminate the right side of the cave interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight does enter from the arch opening and continues to illuminate the right side of the cave interior. The visual clues indicating bright light patterns on the rocky surfaces are consistent with how sunlight naturally behaves in such environments. Image A depicts similar sunlight patterns, confirming the illumination is maintained in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the rocky, uneven ground surface visible beneath the arch and extending toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) clearly shows the rocky and uneven ground surface that extends from beneath the arch toward the foreground. This is evidenced by the visible textures and shadows that suggest rough terrain. Comparing Image A, the ground appears similarly rocky and uneven, indicating the ground surface remains unchanged in the edit.",

      "question": "Is the bright sky and distant tree-covered hillside still visible through the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the bright sky is visible through the arch opening, but the tree-covered hillside is not as clear due to the presence of a spectral, blue creature. The sky remains bright, yet the creature obscures part of the view. In Image A, both the bright sky and the hillside are clearly visible. The comparison shows that while some of the sky is visible, the hills are partially obscured in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cave interior structured with converging rock walls and a clear path leading toward the arch opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the cave's interior structure of converging rock walls, which form a natural path leading toward the arch opening. This is evident by the rock formation and path that remain discernible despite the added blue spectral figure. When compared to Image A, this structural aspect is consistent, showing minimal alteration to the caveâ€™s layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the surrounding rock walls still composed of layered sedimentary rock with natural weathering patterns and beige-to-brown coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rock walls in Image B maintain their appearance of layered sedimentary rock, complete with natural weathering patterns. Their beige-to-brown coloration remains visible, as the spectral figure added does not cover all areas of the rock surfaces. Comparing with Image A, the rock wall composition appears unchanged, ensuring continuity in these geological features.",
