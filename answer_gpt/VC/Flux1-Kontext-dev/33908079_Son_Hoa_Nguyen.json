      "question": "Is the orange circular logo with the white animal figure clearly visible on the sack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the sack in Image B, we can identify an orange circular logo with a distinctive white figure that resembles an animal. The logo is prominently displayed on the sack, suggesting its purpose or brand identity. World knowledge indicates such logos are often designed for easy recognition and identification. Thus, based on its visibility and clarity in the image, we can affirmatively determine the presence of the logo.",

      "question": "Is the worker’s right hand visibly reaching into the tea bush to pick leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker's right hand is protruding into the greenery, positioned in such a way that suggests she is engaged in the act of picking. The posture of the hand aligns with common practices of manually picking leaves from plants. Therefore, based on visual assessment and contextual understanding of agricultural practices, the worker's right hand is indeed reaching into the tea bush to pick leaves.",

      "question": "Is the worker leaning forward with her upper body angled downward toward the tea plants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the worker extending her upper body toward the plants with a forward bend, indicative of an active engagement with the plants below her. This posture is typical for tasks like picking, where closer access to the plants is required. Understanding typical body mechanics during such tasks supports the conclusion that the worker is indeed leaning forward with her upper body angled downward toward the tea plants.",

      "question": "Is the sack positioned on the left side of the worker’s waist and hanging downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visually analyzing Image B, we observe the sack tied around the worker's waist, specifically resting on her left side. The attachment suggests a functional design allowing the worker to collect or store the picked items conveniently. The downward hang of the sack is aligned with gravity and typical carrying styles. Consequently, the sack is confirmed to be positioned on the worker's left side and hangs downward.",

      "question": "Are the tea plants arranged in distinct diagonal rows across a sloped terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts clear lines of demarcation among the tea plants, creating distinct diagonal rows across the field. The visual perspective suggests a sloped terrain, which is common in tea plantations to facilitate water drainage and sunlight exposure. The strategic arrangement not only supports such farming practices but is visually evident as diagonal patterns within the image. Hence, there are distinct diagonal rows across a sloped terrain.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing the attire in Image B, the worker is depicted in a shirt characterized by its long sleeves and olive-green color. Such apparel might be chosen for protection against environmental elements during fieldwork. The clothing visually complies with these characteristics, affirming the presence of a long-sleeved olive-green shirt.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hairstyle in Image B shows the worker's hair pulled back, forming a low ponytail, which indicates practicality for fieldwork to keep hair securely tied and out of the way. Some stray strands visible near the face add further detail to the style, suggesting a natural tendency when securing hair in such manner. Therefore, the description of the worker’s dark hair in a low ponytail with some loose strands is accurate.",
