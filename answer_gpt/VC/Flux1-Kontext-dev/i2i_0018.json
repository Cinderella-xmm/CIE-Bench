      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clock tower depicted with clear clock faces, visible on the upper part of the tower. These clock faces indicate the functionality of the tower as a clock tower. By combing visual cues with world knowledge, the presence of these faces can be confirmed.",

      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly positions the clock tower in the center of the illustration, making it the focal point. The symmetrical arrangement of surrounding elements like flowers further supports this central positioning, emphasizing the tower's prominence in the composition.",

      "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative floral arrangement around the base of the clock tower, consisting of multiple colors.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has an illustration style that utilizes bold colors and defined outlines, similar to artwork found in metal badges with glossy enamel coloring. This can be deduced from the shiny appearance of the colored elements, such as blue stones and flowers, and the simplistic yet stylized rendering of the clock tower.",
