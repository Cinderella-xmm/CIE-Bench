    "Question": "Q1: Is the tabletop still circular in shape?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a tabletop that is indeed circular, as evidenced by its shape and symmetry visible in the image. Circular tabletops are common for tables, providing a balanced surface area for placing items.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does a single vertical column extend from the center of the tabletop to the base?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals a more complex structure connecting the tabletop to the base. Instead of a single, simple column, there is a steampunk-themed design with multiple components including arms and a detailed base. Hence, the concept of a single vertical column does not apply here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the base consist of five symmetrically arranged legs forming a star shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base features four legs connected to a central body, which is visually more mechanical and elaborate compared to the simple central column and the five-legged base in Image A. The star shape formed by five legs is not present in this edited version.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small black rubber feet at the tip of each leg?",
    "explanation": "There are no visible rubber feet at the tips of the legs in Image B. Instead, each leg is designed in a way characterized more by a metallic and articulated look, consistent with the steampunk style.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the height of the central column approximately equal to the diameter of the tabletop?",
    "explanation": "Image B's design shifts away from the classic table structure found in Image A. The column is replaced by a more rounded, elaborate body and arms that connect the tabletop to the base. The height compared to the diameter of the tabletop is visually less, setting aside the conventional ratio link.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the main body of the table still made of a shiny, silver-colored metal?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a main body featuring steampunk motifs, predominantly in a bronze and green color palette, contrasting the shiny silver look of Image A. This stylistic shift highlights an intricate vintage design rather than the plain contemporary metal style.",
    "answer": "No"
