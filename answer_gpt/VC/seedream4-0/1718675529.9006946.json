      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are ocean waves present and breaking onto the sandy shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays stylized ocean waves that appear in a geometric shape. These waves, depicted in a continuous curved line, suggest movement toward the shore. Common wave patterns, such as cresting or breaking onto the beach, are represented abstractly in this artistic form, indicating that waves are indeed part of the composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sandy beach present and curving from the foreground toward the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a stylized sandy beach is depicted, which extends and curves from the prominent foreground toward the right side of the image. This design choice is typical in landscape representations to provide depth and perspective, indicating a continuation of the beach.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are palm trees visible along the coastline on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays palm trees along the right side of the coastline. These iconic tropical trees are positioned to enhance the beachscape, affirming the inclusion of palm trees in the scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there three distinct rock formations visible in the foreground sand, clustered together near the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an abstract representation of rock formations with geometric shapes. Three distinct shapes resembling rocks are present on the sandy shore, contributing to the designed beach environment, so these can be interpreted as rocks in the given context.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are footprints and ripple patterns visible in the wet sand near the waterâ€™s edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not illustrate footprints or ripple patterns in the sand, as the image subscribes to a stylized, geometric approach. Such details are typically omitted in abstract representations, focusing instead on larger forms and shapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the coastline visible as a curved line extending into the distance, with green hills rising behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coastline is represented by a series of linear geometric shapes extending into the background, creating a visual sense of distance. Hills are abstractly depicted behind the coastline, using dark tones which suggest elevation without specific color realism.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky visible above the horizon, featuring clouds with warm orange and pink tones near the horizon and transitioning to blue higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a sky above the horizon, with stylized clouds and a prominent sun. The sky does not feature a gradual color transition or warm tones; instead, it adopts a solid color scheme that is typical of stylized art, focusing on shapes and contrasts over color gradients.",
