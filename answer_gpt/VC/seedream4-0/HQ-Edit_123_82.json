      "question": "Is the woman’s hair styled in a short, straight black bob that frames her face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair is depicted in an illustrated style, clearly shown as a short, straight black bob that frames her face. This is visually similar to the depiction in Image A, albeit in a more animated style. A bob haircut is typically characterized by its length being around chin level and straight, which matches the appearance here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the woman wear a red sleeveless dress with visible knitted texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is illustrated as red and sleeveless, but it lacks the visible knitted texture that is present in Image A. Instead, it has a smooth and decorative design with floral embroidery. The knitted texture from Image A is not portrayed in the edited version.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings behind her back colored with blue centers, brown borders, and orange tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings retain the same color scheme as seen in Image A, with blue centers, brown borders, and orange tips. These colors are consistent even in the transition from real to illustrated depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands clasped together in front of her chest with fingers interlocked?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the woman’s hands are shown in front of her chest. However, in Image B, her hands appear to be placed together rather than interlocked, similar to a prayer pose. This is consistent in both images despite the stylization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a light-colored strap crossing diagonally from her right shoulder to her left hip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light-colored strap is visible in Image B crossing diagonally from her right shoulder to her left hip. This is similarly depicted in Image A, indicating the presence of a strap from a bag or accessory.",

      "question": "Do the woman’s fingernails have bright red polish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's fingernails are not specifically detailed to show bright red polish, which is clearly seen in Image A. The animated style and lack of distinct detailing in the illustration do not emphasize the nail color.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman smiling with red lipstick and dark eyes visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, including lipstick and eyes, are not discernible due to the blurred face. Thus, it is impossible to determine if she is smiling with red lipstick and visible dark eyes based solely on this image.",
