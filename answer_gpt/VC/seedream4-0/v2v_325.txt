    "Question": "Q1: Is the blue car in the upper left position still rendered in blue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the upper left car is a caricature-style vehicle with a face and smiley features. It retains the same relative position as in Image A.

    "Question": "Q2: Does the red car in the upper middle position retain the compact sedan body shape with a sloped roofline and four doors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car in the upper middle position appears to have a cartoonish rendition with a face and exaggerated facial features. The overall shape retains some attributes of a compact sedan, but due to the stylized presentation, elements like a sloped roofline and specific door placements are less pronounced. Compared to Image A, where these elements are clear, Image B takes on a more comedic, less realistic shape while still alluding to a compact sedan style.",

    "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the cars are rendered with the standard vehicular wheel configuration of two wheels at the front and two at the rear.
