        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding appears as flat LEGO blocks without any intricate patterns or motifs. The nature of LEGO, comprising uniform colored blocks, limits the inclusion of detailed designs like botanical patterns. Without distinct designs visible on the LEGO blocks, it indicates that the bedding lacks any specific pattern.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding shows white and light blue LEGO blocks. The bed frame itself is primarily constructed using white blocks, while the bedding, including the blanket part, features light blue LEGO blocks. Therefore, the LEGO version maintains a color scheme of white with light blue accents.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO pillows are positioned on the left side of the bed. They consist of distinct layers and appear to be made up of several LEGO blocks, approximating the shape of two stacked pillows. It appears to have a structure indicative of exactly the same two pillow shapes stacked vertically.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the blanket constructed from blue LEGO blocks, clearly positioned on the right half of the bed, covering part of this area. Although LEGO elements can't perfectly recreate a folded blanket's texture, the positioning mimics a folded blanket.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is uniformly neutral gray, lacking visible textures or additional elements. The photograph's gray background is consistent without varied patterns, indicative of a LEGO setting to focus on the bed composition.",
