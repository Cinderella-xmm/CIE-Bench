      "question": "Is the kite depicted in the shape of a diamond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is distinctly shaped like a diamond, which is characterized by its elongated quadrilateral shape. This conclusion is drawn from observing the symmetrical angles and the pointed top and bottom edges of the kite, adhering to the common depiction of a diamond shape for kites.",

      "question": "Does the kite retain its bright yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B is indeed bright yellow. This is noticeable from its vivid color that stands out against the blue sky. The color is consistent with typical kites made of lightweight materials that attract attention through their bright colors.",

      "question": "Are two strings visibly attached to the kite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of Image B, there's only one string visibly attached to the kite leading downwards. This conclusion is based on the observation that the kite's design includes a single line, which is typical for kites as one string provides the tension needed to control the kite's movement in the air.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the kite against a sky backdrop, although it is part of a paper cut illustration. The elements such as clouds and sun are depicted, creating the impression of a clear sky â€” a setting often associated with activities such as kite flying, which requires favorable weather conditions.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B comes with a yellow tail. This is evident from the visual cue of a flowing yellow strip attached beneath the kite, which is commonly used to provide stability and balance while enhancing the aesthetic of the kite.",
