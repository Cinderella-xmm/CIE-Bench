      "question": "Is the main subject of the new scene (seaside café elements) centrally positioned on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central focus is on the unique tabletop, which has an overlay of water waves, with sunlight reflections creating an interesting visual effect. The table is positioned prominently in the foreground of the image, and the wave effect is centered on the table, making it the main subject of this artistic scene.",

      "question": "Does the new scene retain a clean and minimalistic style with no extraneous objects or clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clean and minimalistic aesthetic, focusing on the table and the wave effect on its surface. The surrounding elements, such as chairs and the beach view, are present but do not create clutter, maintaining an open and uncluttered composition.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the perspective and composition of the new scene consistent with the original, providing a clear view of the seaside café tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perspective in Image B provides a clear and direct view of the tabletop with the wave effect. While Image A features a phone on a stand, Image B opts for a café setup that is entirely different. Nevertheless, the tabletop is fully visible, showing that the perspective provides clarity and unobstructed view of the new elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight reflections are prominently displayed on the tabletop, blending with the effect of waves to create a shiny, reflective surface. This is a distinctive and intentional part of the composition, adding to the aesthetic impact.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an imaginative depiction where waves appear on the table's surface, giving the impression of the sea merging with the café setting. These waves are the central artistic addition that defines the scene, making them quite visible on the surface of the table.",
