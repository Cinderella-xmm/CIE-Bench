    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original grayish stone texture of the pyramid’s surface retained, including visible weathering and erosion patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid is visually altered with the integration of a dragon-like creature. While the stone texture is still visible, it is greatly modified with added elements such as scales and vines. The weathering patterns are not distinctly observable due to the transformation into a fantastical theme. The dragon's presence overpowers typical stone surface markings, indicating alteration from the original stone texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid preserved as a flat, rectangular structure with defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a pyramidal structure influenced by fantasy with transformative design elements like the dragon's head replacing the original top flat surface. The defined edges and flat structure are gone, replaced by the creature's morphology, which disrupts the rectangular platform typical of the original pyramid. Comparing this to Image A, we see the complete replacement with fantasy elements indicating a change in structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central staircase remain aligned along the front face of the pyramid, extending from the top temple to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central staircase visible in Image A is not evident in Image B due to the design change involving the dragon-like creature and additional decorative elements that redefine the pyramid's structure. In Image B, there is no staircase visible as the creature occupies the forefront, highlighting the change in orientation and accessibility of the structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly nine distinct tiers visible in the pyramid’s structure, decreasing in size from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original tier-based step pattern of the pyramid is obscured by the fantasy element, the dragon incorporated into the structure. The classical tier-based format appears transformed or integrated into the creature's body, obscuring the definitive nine-tier design from Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are patches of moss and small vegetation visible along the edges and steps of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is less indication of natural overgrowth, such as moss and small vegetation, along the steps and edges of the pyramid. The incorporation of fantastical elements contributes more to a mythical design than a naturally weathered one, reducing visibility of natural vegetation compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow cast by the pyramid positioned to the lower right, consistent with sunlight coming from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears more fantastical with the presence of glowing elements and enhanced colors. The overall shadow direction or consistency isn't as clear or typical of sunlight reflecting from a natural angle as in Image A; the scene is highly stylized with less emphasis on natural light behavior. Sunlight source orientation may not effectively reflect realistic shadow placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the pyramid located in the center of a dense tropical jungle, with trees surrounding it on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, like Image A, the pyramid remains in a jungle setting surrounded by dense foliage, consistent with the original depiction of a tropical environment. The fantastical changes affect the pyramid's surface and elements but not the surrounding landscape, which remains consistent between both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the top platform of the pyramid covered with dry soil and patches of moss, indicating natural overgrowth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top platform of the pyramid in Image B is transformed by a mythical creature configuration, negating the visibility of natural overgrowth such as dry soil or moss patches observed in Image A. The fantasy theme removes the original detailing of overgrown elements on the pyramid's surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there multiple white vehicles parked on the grassy area near the base of the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fantastical context provided does not include elements like vehicles that belong in a realistic setting seen in Image A. Image B converts the area into a more mythical landscape with no evidence of modern technology or vehicles present around the pyramid.",
