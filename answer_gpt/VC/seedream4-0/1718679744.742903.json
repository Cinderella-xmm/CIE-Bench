      "question": "Is the crocodile's snout with two visible teeth present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B (the edited image), the snout of the crocodile is depicted with intricate patterns resembling a stained-glass or mosaic style illustration. Through these patterns, two distinct teeth prominently stand out at the front of the snout, much like in the original image, even though the artistic style is different. By recognizing the characteristic reptilian snout and teeth in this artwork, it can be concluded that the snout with two visible teeth is present.",

      "question": "Is the colorful knitted hat with a red pom-pom still present on the crocodile's head in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is portrayed wearing a hat with apparent streaks of bright colors, including a noticeable red pom-pom on the top. This artistic rendering faithfully retains the colorful and whimsical style of the hat from Image A despite the shift in art style. The presence of these elements confirms that the colorful knitted hat with a red pom-pom is indeed present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the orange-framed sunglasses with reflective lenses still positioned over the crocodile's eyes in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is illustrated with orange-framed sunglasses that feature reflective lenses. The artwork captures the same vibrant color and reflective quality present in the original image (Image A), where the sunglasses rest over the crocodile's eyes. This suggests that the orange-framed sunglasses with reflective lenses are accurately represented.",

      "question": "Is the crocodile's head oriented forward with a slight leftward turn in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the crocodile's head shows a forward orientation with the snout and eyes slightly turned to the left side of the image. This perspective is consistent with how the crocodile's head was oriented in the original Image A. Therefore, it can be concluded that the head's orientation is indeed forward with a slight leftward turn.",

      "question": "Is the crocodile partially submerged in water in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile appears to be in a watery environment, with the lower part of its body partially surrounded by water depicted with colorful reflections. Although the art style is illustrative and abstract, it successfully conveys the idea of the crocodile being in the water based on positioning and surrounding colors. This aligns with Image A's depiction, where the crocodile is partially submerged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there reflections visible in the lenses of the sunglasses in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts the sunglasses with reflective lenses, showing simplified but clear reflections. These reflections are artistically consistent with how light or environment might reflect off sunglasses in a realistic scenario. Therefore, although abstract, the visual representation suggests the presence of reflections in the lenses, akin to what is seen in Image A.",
