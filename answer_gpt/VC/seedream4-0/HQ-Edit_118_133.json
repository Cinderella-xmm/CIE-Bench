      "question": "Is the complex scrollwork and floral engraving pattern visible on the body, lid, and spout of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has an intricate design with scrollwork and floral engravings clearly visible on the body and spout. The lid, however, is replaced by an open top with a visible candle, so the lid portion does not have any engraving. We can note these patterns by observing the elegant and detailed spirals and floral motifs that are common in ornate designs.",

      "question": "Does the object have a domed lid topped with a small finial at the apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object does not have a domed lid with a finial. Instead, it is replaced with an open top for a candle and wick to be placed, indicating it has undergone modification from a typical teapot to a candle holder. Whereas, Image A has a domed lid with a finial.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the object supported by a three-legged pedestal base with decorative feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the object features a single round base with decorative floral patterns around the bottom edge, rather than a three-legged pedestal. It indicates a more stable, typical base for an object like a candle holder. In Image A, the object indeed stands on three decorative feet characteristic of traditional teapot designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a curved handle attached to the left side of the object, extending upward and backward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a handle with smooth, elegant curves extending upwards and backwards, connected to the left side of the object. This shape is typical for handles designed for ergonomic and aesthetic purposes, often seen in ornate teapots or decorative items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spout is long and elegantly curved, extending from the right side of the object's body. This feature maintains the traditional teapot appearance and aesthetic, even though the top has been modified for a candle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the object placed on what appears to be a polished wooden table, featuring visible reflections underneath. This is deduced from the shiny appearance and the reflection of the object's base on the surface, similar to reflective surfaces commonly used for showcasing decorative items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any metal fittings where the handle attaches to the body. The handle appears to be seamlessly integrated into the design without any additional fittings, which is distinct from Image A where decorative metal fittings are present.",
