    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bust oriented in a side profile facing to the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bust of Apollo is oriented straightforward, facing slightly to the left, not in a side profile. The visible angles of the shoulders and the drapery position confirm this orientation. A side profile would typically show a more pronounced view of the side of the head and a single shoulder, which is not the case here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there an inscribed plaque on the base with the word \"APOLLO\" visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bust clearly shows an inscribed plaque with the word 'APOLLO.' The plaque is easily readable and centrally placed, indicating the identity of the figure represented by the bust.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest consistent with the original sculptural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the proportions of the neck, shoulders, and chest appear consistent with classical sculptural standards, similar to Image A. The edits made do not alter these anatomical elements. The form maintains a realistic proportion typical of human anatomy in art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows drapery that begins at the left shoulder and extends across the chest in a diagonal manner, similar to a classical toga style, consistent with many busts of ancient figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bust is still cylindrical. However, the steampunk modifications add gears and dials to the base, which is not typical for a classical cylindrical pedestal, which usually has a simple round shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small circular medallion or button-like ornament on the left shoulder of the drapery. This element is consistent with decorative details often added to emphasize garment embellishments in sculptures.",
