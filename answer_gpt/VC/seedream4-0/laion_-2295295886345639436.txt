    "Question": "Q1: Is the mouth wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the figures are depicted with facial expressions that traditionally convey exertion or strength. The modern-era figure, while lifting weights, has a face that suggest such expressions. Given the posture of displaying strength or effort, it's plausible the mouth is wide open in a roaring expression, though the depiction may not show detailed features like teeth and tongue due to illustration style, but the open mouth fit with the roaring expression expected from visual knowledge of exertive poses.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the head have a balding crown with hair along the sides and back?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the modern-era figure appears to have a full head of hair, as does the antiquity figure. The character wearing a helmet in the medieval setting typically would have shaved or kept short hair for practical reasons, but the illustration doesnâ€™t show a balding crown. Using the visual cues of the illustration style, there are no markers or design callbacks to the visual trope of balding crowns.",
