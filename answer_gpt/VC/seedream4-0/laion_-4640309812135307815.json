      "question": "Is the woman’s hairstyle still platinum blonde with shoulder-length soft waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman has been replaced by a large red fragrance bottle, which completely obscures any view of her hairstyle. Therefore, it's impossible to deduce anything about the hairstyle based on Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the woman has been replaced with a fragrance bottle in Image B, her lips and any makeup such as lipstick cannot be observed. Thus, there's no evidence of bright red lipstick.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background still shows black vertical slats with copper horizontal lines, similar to those seen in Image A, indicating that this element remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's right hand and the red clutch are not visible as the fragrance bottle takes their place, hence the clutch is no longer visible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, a hand is shown reaching behind the fragrance bottle (in place of the woman) and holding hands with the man. This suggests continuity with the original gesture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fragrance bottle in Image B is designed with an elongated and slightly curved shape, which mimics the flowy silhouette of the woman's dress in Image A, suggesting a retention of the silhouette style.",

        "No"
      ],
