      "question": "Is the central touchscreen still positioned in the center of the dashboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edit converts the image into a calligraphic style representation. Despite the stylistic changes, the central region of the dashboard retains the touchscreen's position. The touchscreen is still positioned in the center, evident from its relationship to the other elements in the cabin such as the steering wheel and dashboard, which remain consistent in placement. By leveraging spatial awareness and common automotive design elements, we can conclude that the touchscreen remains centrally located.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dashboard retain its general structure and placement relative to the steering wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the dashboard is rendered in a calligraphic style, its structure and relative placement to the steering wheel can still be discerned. The general outline and spatial arrangement are maintained, allowing us to use context about typical vehicle design to understand that these elements have remained in their original positions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the steering wheel still partially visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even with the stylized transformation, the steering wheel is visibly present on the left side of the image. The recognizable shape and placement in relation to the dashboard support the conclusion that the steering wheel's visibility is unchanged.",

      "question": "Does the overall spatial arrangement of the vehicle's interior remain consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylized transformation in Image B, the relative arrangement of the elements, such as the dashboard, touchscreen, and steering wheel, are consistent with typical car interior layouts. These relationships are maintained, indicating that the spatial arrangement hasn't changed from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the screen's display has been transformed into a calligraphic style, yet the airflow graphics are still represented, albeit in a stylized manner. The general positions of these graphics on the screen allow us to deduce the intended representation, showing that they are still discernible despite the artistic rendering.",
