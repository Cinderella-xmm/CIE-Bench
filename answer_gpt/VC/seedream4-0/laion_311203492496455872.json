      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red circular insignia still present on the left lapel of the suit jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket maintains the red circular insignia on the left lapel, consistent with visual elements common on formal attire. Despite the transformation into a digital art style, the insignia remains recognizable. Comparison with Image A confirms the presence of the insignia, indicating continuity across both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ear clearly visible on the left side of the head in its original anatomical position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear can be seen on the left side of the head. It appears well-defined and positioned in an anatomically correct location despite the stylized representation. This matches Image A, where the ear is also visible and in its natural position.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth open in a natural smile showing the upper row of teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the edited imageâ€™s style and the facial area being blurred, no discernible features such as a smiling mouth or visible teeth are present. Without reference to Image A, it's logical in Image B there is no visible smile due to the stylization and the visibility issues caused by its blurred face.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the nose retaining its original shape with a distinct bridge and rounded tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nose area is not discernible due to stylization and blurring. Typically, noses would have a distinct bridge and rounded tip, but these features cannot be confirmed here. Image A shows a nose in expected anatomy, but Image B does not provide clear visual information.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head turned to the right in a three-quarter profile view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the head facing directly forward, characterized by symmetrical features relative to the viewer. A three-quarter profile would typically show the side of the face more prominently, which is not the case here. Image A supports a similar frontal viewpoint.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly off-white with no additional textures or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is uniformly off-white and plain, with no discernible textures or objects interfering with the plain appearance. Image A similarly fits this description, maintaining consistency between the images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the shadows under the chin and along the jawline soft and consistent with even frontal lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are minimal shadows under the chin and along the jawline due to the stylized art format. The lighting suggests a smooth transition consistent with even frontal lighting. Comparison with Image A shows similar lighting, though natural shadows occur.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the shirt collar properly aligned and connected to the neck beneath the suit jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shirt collar aligned and connected appropriately to the neck area beneath the suit jacket. Despite the stylistic alterations, the alignment remains intact. Observations in Image A reinforce the proper collar arrangement and connection.",
