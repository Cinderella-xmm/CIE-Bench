      "question": "Is the feathered plume still present on top of the knight's helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is shown as a chibi character encased in a glass dome, and the helmet is simplistic and lacks intricate details such as a plume. The design focuses on a minimalistic style, which often omits detailed accessories like plumes for simplicity. Therefore, the visual cue indicates that there is no feathered plume on top of the knight's helmet.",

      "question": "Is the rampant lion emblem clearly visible on the shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight's shield is depicted as a simple round shield with no intricate designs or emblems such as a rampant lion. The style prioritizes simplicity over detailed heraldic symbols, common in such art styles. Therefore, the rampant lion emblem is not present or visible on the shield.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knight holding a long spear or lance in their right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight is holding a sword, not a long spear or lance. The design choice here is influenced by the chibi style, where exaggerated and simplified forms are used, making traditional knight armaments, like swords, more common than spears or lances. Hence, the knight is not holding a spear or lance.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the knight's pauldrons and greaves visibly present in the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight's armor includes visible pauldrons (shoulder guards) and greaves (shin protection), which are common features in knight armor design, even in simplified or stylized versions like a chibi character. These elements help maintain the recognizable form of armor despite the simplified art style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the castle's main turret with a conical roof and flagpole still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a castle with a turret design similar to that in Image A is visible in the background. The turret has a conical roof, and a flagpole is present at the top. This maintains continuity with the castle design from Image A, indicating that the main turret's key features are still visible.",

      "question": "Are strands of ivy hanging down from the top of the archway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, strands of ivy can be seen hanging down from the top of the glass dome within which the chibi knight and castle are encased. This mimics the appearance in Image A, where ivy hangs from the archway, suggesting continuity in the environmental elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the knight positioned facing toward the right side of the image, with the shield on the left arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight character is facing towards the front, roughly towards the viewer, with no clear directional orientation like facing right or left. This differs from Image A, where the original knight is facing towards the right with the shield on the left arm. Therefore, the position is not the same as described in the question.",
