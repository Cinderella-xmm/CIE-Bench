      "question": "Are the eyes almond-shaped and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred in the cartoon character, making it impossible to discern specific details about the eyes. However, the cartoon style typically features simplified and exaggerated facial features, such as large, symmetrical eyes, but due to the blurring, we cannot confirm their shape or positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small gold hoop earrings present in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character design includes the presence of small, gold hoop earrings which are clearly visible in both ears of the character. This is a common accessory choice in stylized cartoon designs, and the round shape and gold color are distinguishable.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right hand placed inside the front pocket of the trousers with fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character holds an object with one hand, and the shorts do not have a pocket for the character to place a hand in. Therefore, there is no depiction of the right hand being placed inside a pocket with fingers visible, unlike the placement of the hand in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation of the character shows hair that mimics a wavy curl pattern commonly stylized in cartoons. The curls are voluminous and shaped clearly, resembling a natural wave pattern, which is consistent with the design choice for stylization in cartoons.",

      "question": "Is the head slightly tilted forward toward the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cartoon character does not show any tilt in the head orientation; it is facing directly forward. This is typical for simple cartoon illustrations where the head is often positioned straightforwardly without much tilt.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing details of the cartoon character include a blouse that features a V-neckline. This is a common design detail that matches the attire in Image A. Additionally, buttons running down the center are visible, consistent with both images.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character wears shorts with suspenders instead of trousers, which do not exhibit a high waist design with a waistband seam and belt loops. This differs from Image A where high-waisted trousers were depicted.",
