      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a chibi-style figurine, which is smooth and features minimalistic and cartoonish facial textures, lacking the realistic, deep wrinkles and cracked texture seen in Image A. Chibi designs prioritize simplicity and cuteness over detailed textures.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
