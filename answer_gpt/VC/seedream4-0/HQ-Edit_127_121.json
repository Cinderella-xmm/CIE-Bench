    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the circular orb-web with clearly defined radial and concentric threads still present and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the web is visible and maintains a structure with radial threads and concentric circles, typical of an orb-web. The spider sits at the center, which suggests the web is still intact and functional. This structure has not been altered significantly from typical orb-web designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches positioned in a natural arc around the web, supporting it from multiple directions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches exhibit a natural curvature that surrounds the web, indicating a supportive role from several sides. This positioning mirrors natural spider webs which utilize surrounding structural elements for support.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leaves retain their oval shape, visible venation, and glossy surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves remain oval-shaped and appear to have a subtle sheen, indicating a glossy texture. The venation isn't sharply visible, but the overall shape and texture are consistent with typical leaves of this type.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, clear water droplets visible on the surfaces of some leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves do not display any small, clear water droplets. The surface of the leaves appears clean and dry, indicating an absence of such droplets.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a soft, uniform pale blue-gray sky without additional elements such as clouds or sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears as a soft, pale blue-gray, and it lacks any distinct elements like clouds or the sun. This uniformity helps the designed web and branches stand out distinctly against it.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the webâ€™s radial threads visibly connected to the branch ends at multiple points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the web's radial threads seem to be reaching toward the branches, but the exact connection points are not overtly visible. However, for a structurally intact web, these connections are crucial and likely present even if not explicitly depicted.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
