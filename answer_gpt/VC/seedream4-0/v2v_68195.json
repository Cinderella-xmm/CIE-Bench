      "question": "Are the gingham accents on the cuffs and back bow still present and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingham accents are visible on both the cuffs and the back bow. The gingham pattern is composed of small, even squares, which are visually discernible and maintain their crispness, indicating they have not been blurred or significantly altered. This is consistent with a clear and defined checkered pattern commonly associated with gingham.",

      "question": "Does the dress retain its original structure with long sleeves, a gathered waistline, and a flared skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress shows long sleeves, a clearly gathered waistline, and a flared skirt, all of which align with the structural elements described. This is evident from the visible seam where the top meets the skirt, causing a slight gathering effect, and the sleeves which appear long due to the placement of the cuffs further down.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Nebraska Huskers\" text area still located in the same position on the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Nebraska Huskers' text, although modified with additional elements like wheat, is located around the chest area. This is the same position as standardized for text placement in most dresses, typically meant for central visibility at eye level, suggesting that the positioning logic remains the same.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dress predominantly red, even if the shade has been deepened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B appears to be predominantly red, although the tone appears deeper and richer, as seen in velvety or more saturated materials. This deeper tone still aligns with the color red but in a darker hue, which is not uncommon for fabric to achieve a more elegant or vivid appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dress still have a gathered waistline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gathered waistline is apparent, as indicated by the slight pleating effect where the top of the dress connects with the skirt portion. This gathering creates volume in the skirt, evident from the folds and collected fabric, characteristic of a gathered waist design.",
