      "question": "Are the characteristic forehead wrinkles of the pug present and accurately represented in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a wooden sculpture of a pug, the forehead wrinkles are represented as grooves on the sculpture, suggesting an emphasis on the characteristic wrinkles of the breed. This is discerned by observing the carved grooves where the pug's forehead would be. Forehead wrinkles are a known feature of pugs, contributing to their distinctive look. However, the depth and texture of the wrinkles in the sculpture are simplified due to the nature of the medium (wood), but they do capture the essence of a pug's forehead wrinkles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black muzzle and surrounding facial marking (including under the eyes and around the nose) preserved in the same location and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, the sculpture, depicts a pug with a smooth wooden finish, lacking color differentiation characteristic of a real pug, such as the distinct black muzzle and facial markings seen in Image A. The sculpture focuses on form rather than color, and the facial markings defined by color in a real pug are absent in the sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the large, round, dark eyes with clearly defined pupils preserved in the same position and shape as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pug with large eyes, consistent with the typical pug appearance. The eyes in the sculpture are round and prominent, similar to Image A, with pupils; however, the detailing and depth in the clear definition seen in Image A are reduced due to the wooden sculpture's simpler nature.",
      "weight": 3,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floppy black ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head and shaped as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears of the pug sculpture are carved symmetrically on top of the head, resembling the shape and position seen in Image A. The sculpture captures the general form of the pug's ears, though lacking color differentiation (black) due to the wooden texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted in an upright sitting position with both front paws placed forward, matching the original stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the pug in an upright sitting position, similar to Image A, with both front paws placed forward. The sculpture reflects the common posture of a pug sitting, consistent with the stance observed in the original image.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the fawn-colored body area preserved in the same region as the original, contrasting with the black facial mask?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a wooden sculpture, does not portray the color contrasts present in a real pug like Image A. The fawn-colored body and contrasting black facial mask of a pug are a result of its natural coloring, which isn't represented in the monolithic wooden texture of the sculpture.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the typical pug proportions, with a broad head compared to its compact body, aligning with the breed's standard features. The sculpture successfully captures this aspect, similar to what is seen in the original image.",
