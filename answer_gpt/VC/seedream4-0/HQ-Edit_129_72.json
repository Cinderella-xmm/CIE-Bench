        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the branch is depicted in a side-facing profile with the head clearly turned towards the left. This is evident from the visibility of only one eye and the direction of the beak pointing left, indicating a left-facing profile.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch appears to extend diagonally from the lower part towards the upper area of the image.
