    "Question": "Q5: Is the lighting in the image coming from above, casting a warm golden glow over the butterfly and flowers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to come from above, but instead of a warm golden glow, there is a cooler, softer light with a slightly magical or ethereal quality. Image A features a distinctly warmer, golden illumination evident across the butterfly and flowers. This contrast indicates that Image B does not have the same warm golden glow as Image A, although both have light coming from above, their temperature and effect differ.",
