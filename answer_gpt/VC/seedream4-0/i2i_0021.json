      "question": "Are the three sheep positioned near each other, with one adult sheep interacting closely with the two younger ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three chibi sheep appear close to each other with an adult sheep positioned slightly apart and two younger ones interacting with a fence, indicating proximity but not direct interaction between the adult and younger sheep. Meanwhile, in Image A, the real sheep are in close proximity with one appearing to interact with each other near the fence. Thus, comparing both images suggests close positioning but less explicit interaction in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original postures, with the adult sheep standing upright and the younger ones leaning towards it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the adult sheep appears to stand more upright with accessories, whereas the two younger sheep maintain a posture leaning towards the fence. This contrasts with Image A where the sheep seem more naturally engaged with one looking slightly towards the adult. The chibi representation simplifies postures yet maintains the leaning stance.",

      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain identifiable sheep-like body proportions, such as a rounded body and small legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi sheep in Image B are stylized but retain distinct sheep-like features: rounded bodies and noticeably small legs compared to their bodies, consistent with cartoon representations. Image A presents real sheep with realistic proportions that translate to a simplified animated form in Image B maintaining these recognizable proportions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible interaction displayed between the adult chibi sheep and the two younger ones, suggesting care or attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the adult chibi sheep is wearing a scarf and looking ahead, not directly interacting with the younger ones who are engaged with another object. The styling and positioning suggest attentiveness but not direct interaction. In Image A, the real sheep show more direct interaction. The chibi representation simplifies interactions visually, indicating less clear direct engagement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi sheep retain a representation of their woolly texture, even in a stylized or simplified manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep are depicted with a stylized rounded shape and simplistic lines suggesting a woolly texture, common in cartoon illustrations. This contrasts with Image A where the real sheep show detailed woolly fur, the chibi form abstracts this into a smooth rounded, yet clearly sheep-like representation.",
