      "question": "Is there a river running down the center of the image from the foreground to the distant mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main feature is a wide pathway with blue and white stripes leading from the foreground to the background. The structure and orientation suggest that this is a representation of water, resembling a river. It maintains a central position, connecting the foreground with the distant background, consistent with how rivers often appear in landscape art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two large mountain peaks visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts two prominent triangular shapes in the background, each on opposite sides. These shapes use angular forms and shading, characteristic of mountains in stylized art, suggesting that they represent mountain peaks located on the left and right sides of the image.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Is there a bright circular light source positioned near the center of the horizon line in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a bright circular shape situated near the center, hovering above the horizon. This shape, given its position and brightness, can be interpreted as a stylized representation of the sun or a celestial body. Its placement near the horizon line is typical in landscape imagery to signify daylight or sunset.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there trees present on both sides of the river, extending along the banks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple geometric shapes along both sides of the blue pathway, resembling stylized trees. These shapes are concentrated along the edges, suggesting a representation of trees lining the riverbanks, stretching from the foreground towards the background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible rock formations or landmasses within the river, breaking the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is highly stylized, with the river represented by a continuous, unbroken expanse of blue and white lines. There are no distinguishable shapes or interruptions within this area that suggest rock formations or landmasses breaking the water surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the river reflect the trees and sky above it, maintaining a mirrored image across the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a geometric and abstract style where the river is represented by striped patterns without any visible reflection on its surface. The artistic choice in this image avoids mirroring elements of the sky or trees, which differs from traditional landscape art where reflections are common.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are depicted using geometric forms in a variety of warm colors, including reds, oranges, and yellows. These colors are indicative of autumn foliage, while some dark green elements are present, resembling conifers commonly found alongside deciduous trees in fall landscapes.",
