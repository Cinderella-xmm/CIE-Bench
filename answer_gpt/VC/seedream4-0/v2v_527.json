      "question": "Does the LEGO-style dog retain the golden color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog constructed from LEGO-like bricks appears to have a golden hue. This conclusion is drawn from the use of yellow and tan bricks that simulate a golden color scheme similar to that of a golden retriever. Such colors visually communicate the golden appearance, leveraging world knowledge that associates yellow and tan bricks with golden coloring.",

      "question": "Is the stop sign still octagonal in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stop sign beneath the LEGO-style dog remains clearly octagonal, maintaining the universally recognized shape of stop signs. This conclusion is drawn from the image showing eight distinct sides, a standard feature of stop signs used globally for traffic control.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the stop sign retain the white \"STOP\" text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the LEGO-style stop sign continues to display the white 'STOP' text on its red surface. This observation comes from the arrangement of white LEGO bricks forming the word 'STOP,' consistent with the original stop sign design found in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style dog is positioned sitting atop the stop sign. This is evident as the dog is made of LEGO blocks and is placed at the top center of the octagonal sign, mirroring its position in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question": "Is the background represented with gradient shading to depict the blue sky and clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background representation uses a gradient of light to deeper blue tones indicating the sky, retaining a realistic depiction with clouds. While the clouds appear slightly stylized due to LEGO aesthetics, the overall gradient shading serves to simulate a sky with white cloud formations, aligning with how skies are commonly depicted.",
