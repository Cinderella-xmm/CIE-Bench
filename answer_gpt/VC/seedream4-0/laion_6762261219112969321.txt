    "Question": "Q1: Are there two separate, cushioned backrest sections positioned side by side?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a fantastical creature that looks similar to a cloud-like formation with swirls and appendages. There is no indication of any backrest or seating arrangement, as the creature does not exhibit any furniture-like features. This is clearly a surreal entity rather than a sofa with backrest sections.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there two armrests, one on each side of the sofa, aligned with the seat cushions?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cloud-like creature has structures resembling branches or antlers but no discernible armrests that would be part of a sofa design. Instead, its form is more organic and not indicative of a sofa with seat cushions or armrests.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the sofa have four legs, one at each corner of the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the creature exhibits puff-like legs but does not have legs resembling those of a sofa, nor are they placed at the corners in a way typical for furniture. The arrangement reflects an animal-like quality, not of a structured piece of furniture like a sofa.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the sofa symmetrically arranged along a vertical centerline, with identical features on the left and right sides?",
    "explanation": "Image B does show a level of symmetry with features like swirling clouds and tree-like appendages; however, this symmetry is reminiscent of an animated or mythical creature rather than a sofa. Thus, it can't be assessed in terms meant for furniture symmetry.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the seat cushions positioned directly beneath the backrest cushions, forming a continuous seating surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks any features resembling cushions or a seating structure. The whimsical design is that of a fantastical fluffy entity rather than any seating arrangement involving cushions beneath a backrest.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there small black circular fasteners visible on the wooden frame, particularly near the armrest joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible wooden frame or any component that resembles fasteners typically used on furniture. The creature's design does not include structural elements associated with furniture like armrest joints or fasteners.",
    "answer": "No"
