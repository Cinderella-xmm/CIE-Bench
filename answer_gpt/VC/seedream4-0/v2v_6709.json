      "question": "Is the faceted star-shaped pattern covering the body of the perfume bottle preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the perfume bottle retains a complex, faceted pattern that closely resembles the star-shaped design seen in Image A. This suggests that the intricate pattern was preserved in the Lego version, maintaining its decorative appearance.",

      "question": "Does the perfume bottle maintain its cylindrical shape with tapered sides and flat base in the Lego construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the body of the bottle displays faceted details, it retains an overall consistent shape with tapered sides and a flat base similar to that in Image A. Thus, the overall shape is maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a gold faceted spherical cap is visible at the top of the bottle, similar in appearance and position to that in Image A. This suggests that the gold faceted design is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle located on the side of the bottleâ€™s neck, with a visible mist plume extending diagonally outward, preserved in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spray nozzle is positioned on the bottle's neck, with a mist plume extending outward, identical to the configuration in Image A. This indicates that the placement and function of the spray nozzle are maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the undulating folds of the fabric background beneath the bottle preserved in form and position in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background beneath the bottle shows extensive use of Lego bricks, altering the fabric's visual appearance. This suggests that the fabric's form and position are not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the perfume bottle positioned directly on top of the fabric background, maintaining contact and alignment with the folds, in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle appears placed on a Lego surface instead of fabric, altering the direct contact and alignment observed in Image A. Therefore, the bottle is not positioned directly on the fabric as before.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the size of the gold cap proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle in the Lego version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold cap appears proportionally consistent with the body of the bottle, similar to how it appears in Image A. The proportional relationship is preserved in the Lego version.",
