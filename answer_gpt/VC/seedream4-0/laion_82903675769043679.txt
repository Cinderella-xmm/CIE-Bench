    "Question": "Q1: Is the curved contour of the fairway, leading from the foreground toward the green, preserved in its original shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fairway is visually depicted using a checkered pattern that follows a similar curvature to a natural golf course terrain. The original shape involves slight undulations typical of golf course fairways, which can still be perceived despite the artistic transformation. Through the shapes and arrangement of the colored squares, the contour seems consistent with what would be expected on a real fairway.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the sand bunkers located in their original positions along the fairway, particularly near the green and on the left side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, sandy areas are clearly visible as lighter colored zones within the checkered pattern, corresponding to the typical location of sand bunkers near the green as seen in golf courses. The position of these features remains identifiable despite the artistic style. In Image A, they are positioned strategically near the green and the left sideâ€”locations that Image B maintains visually.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the water hazard present in the foreground, directly bordering the fairway, and reflecting the sky and structures?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a colorful abstract surface representing the water hazard, situated in the same foreground location as Image A. The reflection of the surrounding area, although stylized, suggests an attempt to maintain the idea of a water surface reflecting both the sky and structures, a characteristic common in water hazards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the AT&T GOLF tower and the white event tents located in the right midground, adjacent to the spectator area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there's a section on the right side that visually corresponds to a tent-like structure with colors resembling those of shelter or event tents, in a similar location as Image A, which denotes the typical placement for such structures during golf events. The AT&T GOLF tower, represented by a colored section resembling its original form, appears in a nearby location consistent with the Image A layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the green area elevated at the back, forming a slight incline from the fairway?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transition area towards the end of the checkered portion inclines slightly upwards, suggesting elevation typical of a green area on a golf course, providing the necessary depth semblance and terrain realism. Image A also represents the green with a gentle slope rising at the back edge.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a dense group of spectators visible along the edge of the fairway, especially near the green?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows color block representations that symbolically and visually suggest the presence of a crowd along the fairway edges, similar to how spectators gather to watch golf. In Image A, spectators are prominently grouped near the green, reflecting their most likely gathering point for optimal viewing, which Image B abstractly preserves through arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
