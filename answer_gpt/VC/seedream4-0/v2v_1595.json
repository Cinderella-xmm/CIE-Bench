      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain exactly 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels arranged in a spherical configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the soccer ball, it features a distinctive arrangement of panels typical of traditional soccer balls. Soccer balls typically consist of 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons, which are arranged in a consistent pattern that forms a spherical shape. By visually inspecting Image B, it is apparent that the ball maintains this arrangement, confirming the presence of 12 black pentagonal panels and 20 white hexagonal panels creating a spherical configuration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball depicted as a three-dimensional sphere with curved surfaces and proper perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the soccer ball clearly as a three-dimensional sphere. The shading, highlights, and alignment of the panels provide a strong indication of depth and curvature, which give the ball a realistic spherical appearance. These visual cues help convey the three-dimensional form and the correct perspective of the ball as it appears in the foreground.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the goalpost maintain a rectangular frame with two vertical posts and one horizontal crossbar forming a standard goal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goalpost is depicted with two vertical posts joined by a horizontal crossbar, forming the recognizable rectangular frame of a standard soccer goal. The arrangement of these components is consistent with the typical structure one would see on a soccer field.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the net of the goalpost composed of a visible grid pattern of intersecting lines forming square or rectangular cells?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, the goalpost net consists of intersecting lines creating a grid pattern, forming square cells. This setup is customary for soccer goalposts, where nets are used to catch the ball and often feature square or rectangular grid patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball positioned in the foreground, in front of the goalpost, with part of the goal visible behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the soccer ball clearly positioned in the foreground, directly in front of the goalpost. Part of the goal is visible behind the ball, establishing a layer perspective where the ball occupies the foremost space and the goal recedes into the background.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the seams between the black and white panels of the soccer ball clearly visible and aligned with the edges of the pentagons and hexagons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seams between the black and white panels are distinct and align accurately with the geometric edges of the pentagonal and hexagonal panels. This alignment is expected as it contributes to the characteristic look and structure of a soccer ball.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the soccer ball centered in the foreground and the goalpost positioned directly behind it in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the soccer ball is centrally placed in the foreground, with the goalpost situated directly behind it as part of the background. This positioning ensures an orderly visual composition where the ball and goal are focused and symmetrically aligned.",
