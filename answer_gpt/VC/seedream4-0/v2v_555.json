      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no white cups or saucers visible. Instead, the focus is on the snow globe containing miniatures of the landmarks, with the cups from Image A replaced by the snow globe. Visual inspection shows that no elements related to cups and saucers are present in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a wooden table surface clearly visible where the snow globe is placed. This matches the original context where the cups were placed on a wooden table in Image A, confirming that the table surface continues to be an element within the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B incorporates depictions of the Colosseum and Big Ben, it does not preserve the brown tones from the latte art seen in Image A. The snow globe provides a different context, focusing on the snowy scene without emphasis on the brown tones that were a part of the latte designs in the original image.",
