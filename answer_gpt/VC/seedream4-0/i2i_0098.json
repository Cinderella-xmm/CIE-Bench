      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a white oval-shaped sink that can be clearly seen sitting on a wooden vanity.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden faucet is visible, positioned centrally over the white oval-shaped sink.
