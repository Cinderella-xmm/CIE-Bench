      "question": "Is the white star with the number \"4\" visible on the turret of the tank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the turret does indeed show a white star followed by the number '4'. This is evident from the appearance and typical markings found on military vehicles. This is similar to what is seen in Image A, confirming consistency.",

      "question": "Are the markings \"31 64A\" and \"A-14\" visible on the lower sides of the tank’s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are altered markings, with different numbers and letters on the front side, notably 'Q 014'. This differs from Image A, which displays '31 64A' and 'A-14' on the lower sides of the tank’s hull. The discrepancy suggests changes made to the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show the tank barrel oriented straight forward from the turret in a direct line. This indicates a frontal orientation typical of tanks meant for direct forward engagement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the museum sign with all the specified text and illustration, identical to the sign visible in Image A. The legibility and consistency across both images affirm the presence of the sign.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a motif with a tiger constructed from smaller pieces, placed in the blue-and-white checkered area on the tank's front hull. This contrasts with Image A, which features a more traditional depiction of a tiger face. Both are indicative of tiger motifs but presented differently.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, like Image A, shows the tank positioned to the left of the museum sign. This spatial arrangement is straightforward based on visual placement within the frame.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s turret is made with block-like structures simulating a cylindrical shape and a single gun barrel. While this reflects a different aesthetic from the cylindrical look in Image A, it maintains a similar functional form, albeit stylistically distinct due to its construction.",
