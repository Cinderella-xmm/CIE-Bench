        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cups are visibly transparent, as you can see the brown liquid inside them. The shape of the cups is cylindrical, as indicated by their round base and evenly shaped sides. This transparency and shape are characteristic of standard drinking glasses.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beverage inside the cups appears to have a consistent brown color, typical of coffee or tea with milk. The surface of the liquid looks smooth, as expected in a calm beverage that has not been stirred vigorously.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam in Image B can be seen rising from the cups in wispy, undulating trails, which appears natural. This steam effect is consistent with hot liquids like coffee or tea when exposed to a cooler environment, creating visible vapor.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are placed on a round table, and their shadows are cast on the surface, indicating a solid and stable placement. The shadows align with a natural light source, likely the background lighting, adding to the realism of the setting.",
