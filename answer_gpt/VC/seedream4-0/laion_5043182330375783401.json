      "question": "Is the mustache present and clearly defined above the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, focusing on the portrayal of the facial hair area above the upper lip, there are no visual cues indicating a mustache. The edited image has a stylized, geometric design, emphasizing bold shapes and colors without detailing facial features such as a mustache. Based on this visual information and the common association of defining mustaches through distinct lines or shading, there is no presence of a mustache.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both eyes closed in the facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without addressing the blurred face, we focus on the characteristic features around the eye region. Image B presents a geometric, abstract style without explicit representation of eyes or expressions, resulting in the absence of visible eyes that could depict any specific expression or state, such as being closed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric design shows the figure with an arm positioned over a chair in a manner that suggests a resting pose. Based on common visual interpretation of postures, this positioning aligns with an arm resting on the chair’s back, characterized by angles suggesting support or relaxation.",

      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a seated position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B gives the impression of a figure in a seated position due to the way the figure is oriented in conjunction with the chair, a common item associated with sitting. The portrayal of the lower body and chair elements supports the interpretation of a sitting pose, even in an abstract context.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the bottom right corner, there are no numbers visible. The composition focuses on colorful and geometric aesthetics without including textual or numerical details, unlike what a scan of a drawing might show.",
