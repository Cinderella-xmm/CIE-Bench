        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the book is open, showing printed text on both pages. The clarity and visibility of text are generally dependent on factors like focus and lighting. The image shows that the pages have a uniform focus and adequate lighting helps in keeping the text legible. Therefore, based on these visual cues, the printed texts are clearly visible despite the angle change.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals the edges and side of the book, indicating its cover. The visible color of the book cover remains pinkish as seen on its spine and edges.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden surface in Image B exhibits texture and grain patterns typical of natural wood, including variations and lines that follow these patterns. The lighting highlights the texture and natural imperfections on the surface, which are characteristic of unaltered wooden backgrounds.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book in Image B is depicted resting on a wooden surface. Its pages are spread out logically, indicating the book is open and aligns naturally on the surface. The positions of the pages reflect how they would typically lay when a book is opened without any external disturbance, maintaining logical orientation and alignment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the pages of the open book exhibit a beige color that usually indicates aging in paper material. The texture and coloration are visible under the lighting conditions, which accentuates their slightly aged appearance. Therefore, the book pages keep this beige, somewhat aged look.",
