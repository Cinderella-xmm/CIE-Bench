      "question": "Is the full white beard present on the figureâ€™s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted wearing attire typical of European upper-class fashion, possibly from the 18th or 19th centuries, including a top hat. The attire and style evoke historical contexts where facial hair might be present. However, due to the lack of visible facial features other than attire, the presence of a beard cannot be confirmed. Based on the attire and historical knowledge, these styles often go with a clean-shaven look or a beard; however, without visual evidence in the image, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is there a red or dark tilak mark positioned between the eyebrows on the forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire is reminiscent of Western formal wear rather than traditional Indian clothing where a tilak might be appropriate. The headgear, cravat, and style signify Western influence, making the presence of a tilak unlikely as it is typically absent in Western fashion history. Therefore, without visual evidence of a tilak, combined with world knowledge about such styles, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the figure displaying an open-mouthed smile showing teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature the figure's facial expression visible due to the style and content of the image. Given the blurred face, it's impossible to confirm an open-mouthed smile. However, the attire reflects a formal demeanor typical of the 18th/19th century Western paintings, where figures usually have composed expressions. Hence, the world knowledge supports 'No' for an open-mouthed smile.",

      "question": "Is the figure standing upright with arms relaxed at the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted standing in a formal posture, characteristic of traditional painted portraits where the subject is standing upright. The visible hand placement indicates a relaxed position, potentially at the sides or holding something. This is consistent with the norms of portraiture of the depicted style. Thus, the answer would be 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Is the figure shown in full-body view and centered in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is represented from about mid-thigh upward, typical for a traditional portrait aimed at showcasing attire and presence. The framing suggests a formal half-body view rather than a full-body shot, which focuses on a clear view of the garments and posture. Thus, the answer is 'No' as it is not a full-body view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred rendering of facial features in Image B, neither the skin tone nor facial textures such as wrinkles are discernible. Hence, the preservation of these details cannot be assessed from the altered image. Using world knowledge about portrait treatment and the visible image, the answer is 'No'.",
