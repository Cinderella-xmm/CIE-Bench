    "Question": "Q1: Is the U.S. $20 bill with its distinctive green color, '20' numeral, and architectural design visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of banknotes is in sketch form with lined drawings rather than actual colors, obscuring the distinctive green hue commonly associated with the U.S. $20 bill. The numeral and architectural designs are indistinct due to the abstract representation. Without color and detail, it is challenging to confirm its presence confidently.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the Indian Rupee 50 note with the lion capital symbol and yellow-brown color clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "The edited image presents banknotes as diagrammatic outlines without displaying the original colors or specific symbols such as the lion capital. The lack of color and detail renders it impossible to visually confirm features specific to the Indian Rupee 50 note.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the U.S. $1 bill with the portrait of George Washington and 'ONE DOLLAR' text present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all banknotes are represented schematically with minimal detail, obscuring any portraits or specific text like 'ONE DOLLAR' found on the U.S. $1 bill. These absent details lead to the conclusion that the U.S. $1 bill is not identifiable.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all four banknotes (U.S. $20, Qatari Riyal, Indian Rupee 50, U.S. $1) present together in the same visual space?",
    "explanation": "Although Image B outlines different banknotes, it does so in a gray-scale schematic form lacking specific identifiers such as color, text, or symbols. Therefore, the presence of the four distinct banknotes can't be verified as being uniquely represented together in this manner.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the original dominant colors of the banknotes (green for USD, pink-orange for QAR, yellow-brown for INR) preserved?",
    "explanation": "The edited image represents the banknotes entirely in gray-scale. The absence of color means that any distinct hues associated with the respective currencies are nonexistent. Thus, the original dominant colors are not preserved in this representation.",
    "answer": "No"
