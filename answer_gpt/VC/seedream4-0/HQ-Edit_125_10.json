      "question": "Is the dragon-headed prow with detailed carvings and open jaws present at the front of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the box art depicts a Vikings ship with a dragon-headed prow at the front. The dragon head is intricately carved, showcasing details typically associated with Viking ships, such as stylized designs on the dragon's head. This is supported by common representations of Viking ships in historical depictions. Therefore, the dragon-headed prow with detailed carvings and open jaws is present.",

      "question": "Is the dark red and black circular knotwork emblem centered on the beige sail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rectangular box art of the game, 'Voyage of the Vikings' features a ship sail with detailed designs. In the center of the sail is a circular emblem with knotwork. However, the emblem does not have a distinct color pattern of dark red and black, as it visually seems more generalized in color. Therefore, the circular knotwork emblem is present, but not distinctly dark red and black.",

      "question": "Are multiple circular shields with distinct symbols mounted along the side of the ship beneath the oars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the box art with shields featuring symbols mounted along the sides of the Viking ship, beneath the oars. This design element is typical in Viking ship representations, where shields were often painted with distinct symbols. Therefore, multiple shields with unique symbols are illustrated and mounted along the side under the oars.",

      "question": "Are there multiple oars extending outward from the hull, each connected to a small human-like figure representing a rower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the depiction of the board game on Image B, there are rowers represented by small figurines on the game board, but these are separate from the main image of the ship where the oars simply extend from the hull without being directly connected to figures representing rowers. This separation makes it clear that oars are not connected to rowers on the ship depiction on the board game box art.",

      "question": "Does the hull consist of clearly defined horizontal wooden planks with visible grain and layered construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box art in Image B shows a Viking ship that has a hull made up of layered wooden planks, typical of historical Viking ship construction. The planks appear clearly defined, with visibility of wood grain patterns. Such details are indicative of traditional ship construction methods involving layered planks with grain visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mast of the Viking ship holds a square sail, which aligns with conventional Viking ship designs. The sail appears attached via ropes, reflecting typical rigging methods from historical maritime practices. Therefore, there is a single central mast supporting an unfurled square-shaped sail.",
