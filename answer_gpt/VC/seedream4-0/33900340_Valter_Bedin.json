      "question": "Is the central archway positioned at the center of the main structure, forming a passageway between the two vertical pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the main focus is a large, towering figure rather than a conventional architectural structure. The central area of this figure has illuminated glyphs or runes, but there is no traditional archway or set of pillars forming a gateway. Therefore, based on visual analysis and world knowledge that refers to traditional architecture, the answer is 'No.'",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two vertical pillars standing symmetrically on either side of the central archway, forming a tall, narrow gateway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not depict a traditional architectural gateway. Instead, it features a colossal humanoid figure that does not have structures resembling an archway or pillars. The humanoid figure's arms may resemble pillars, but they are not arranged to form a gateway. Therefore, the answer is 'No.'",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the battlements along the top of the structure composed of repeating rectangular merlons and gaps (crenels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of the edited image, the figure portrayed does not include architectural features such as battlements, merlons, or crenels. It is purely a giant figure with runes, without any battlements visible in a recognizable wall structure. Thus, the answer is 'No.'",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a long, low brick wall running parallel to the main structure on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this edited image, there is no visible parallel brick wall alongside any main structure. The scene is dominated by the giant humanoid figure and an expanse of landscape. Common elements of a brick wall are absent from the scene, leading to the conclusion of 'No.'",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a paved pathway extending from the foreground toward the central archway, running between the low wall and the main structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a pathway leading towards the giant figure, but not between a low wall and a main structure. Instead, the path leads up to this figure and is part of an open landscape. There is no archway between which the path extends. Thus, the answer is 'No.'",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there additional arched openings visible to the right of the main central archway, integrated into the same wall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this edited image, no traditional architectural elements such as archways are present. There are no arched openings integrated into a wall structure because the focus is on a humanoid figure with runes. Therefore, it leads to the conclusion that the answer is 'No.'",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is indeed a small figure, but they are moving towards the giant humanoid figure, not a central archway. The small figure is a glowing, ethereal figure moving along a pathway, but without any reference to an archway in the scene. The answer is 'No.'",
