    "Question": "Q1: Does the car retain the distinctive angular LED headlights and central grille intake characteristic of the McLaren 720S?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car has distinctive rounded LED headlights and a central grille intake that are trademarks of the McLaren P1, not the McLaren 720S which typically has more angular and flared designs. The McLaren P1 features organic curves and distinct styling elements typical of its model. By comparing these design elements with common sports car knowledge, it's evident that this is not a 720S.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the road still a curved two-lane highway with continuous double yellow lines running down its center?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car is displayed inside a glass case. Hence, the road depicted in Image A, a typical highway with double yellow lines, is not present surrounding the car but only visible as part of the backdrop of the display within the box.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the left-hand hillside still present with its reddish-brown slopes and scattered autumnal vegetation?",
    "explanation": "Image B, while it features a backdrop that includes a landscape, presents this within a glass box backdrop rather than the natural landscape surrounding the car as in Image A. Thus, the reddish-brown slopes are part of this display backdrop, but they are not present as an actual hill.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a concrete guardrail along the right side of the road, separating it from the ocean?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the complete road setting is replaced by a showcase environment where the car is placed inside a glass box with a backdrop. No concrete guardrail is physically separating an open road from the ocean as it might have in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the car positioned centrally on the right side of the road, facing forward toward the horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car is inside a display glass case, not on an actual road, so there is no relevant road positioning such as described. The car is depicted inside a controlled display environment rather than positioned on a road.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are rocky outcrops visible in the distant sea, with mist or spray rising near the shore?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rocky outcrops and mist/spray are present as part of the scenic backdrop inside the glass display case. This mimics a coastal landscape setting, but these elements are not naturally occurring or directly captured from an outdoor scene as in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the red racing seats with black accents visible through the windshield inside the car?",

    "answer": "Yes"
