    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly six wheels arranged in three axles, with the front axle near the cab and two rear axles supporting the cargo body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited truck is crafted in a crystal-like appearance but maintains the original structure in terms of wheel arrangement. It has six wheels: two in the front near the cab and four in the back supporting the cargo body, arranged in three axles. This pattern aligns with the realistic design needed for such trucks to distribute the load effectively.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cargo body positioned directly behind the cab, maintaining the same horizontal alignment and proportional length as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation into a crystal-like model, the cargo body remains directly behind the cab with a similar horizontal alignment and proportional length. This suggests that the transformation focused on material rather than altering the structural or positional elements of the design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two rectangular windows visible on the side of the cargo body, located approximately one-third and two-thirds along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B displays two rectangular windows on the side of the cargo body. They are placed in positions that seem roughly one-third and two-thirds along the cargo body's length, mirroring typical placement for such windows in utility vehicles to allow for ventilation and light.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vertical slatted grille present on the front of the vehicle, centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the vehicle maintains a vertical slatted grille, which is still centered between the headlights and aligned with the hood. This typical design feature is prominent in utility trucks for engine cooling and has been retained even in this crystalline transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a side mirror attached to the driver’s side door, extending outward from the upper portion of the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a side mirror visible, which is attached to the driver's side door and extends outward at the upper portion. Preserving features like side mirrors is crucial for visibility and safety, which are key components of functional vehicle design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body, running parallel to the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a horizontal ladder affixed to the lower side of the cargo body. The crystalline structure focuses more on the aesthetic transformation and might have excluded non-essential functional features such as ladders.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a silver-colored door handle visible on the driver’s side door, positioned midway down the door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, there is no silver-colored door handle visible on the driver’s side door. The focus on a crystal-like structure means some traditional features like distinct colored handles might have been omitted or styled differently for the desired aesthetic effect.",
