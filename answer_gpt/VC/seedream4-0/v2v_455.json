        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a rust-orange jacket across all illustrations. This color consistency is evident through the distinct orange hue associated with the character's upper body clothing. The character is seen performing various activities, and each time the jacket maintains its rust-orange color. Therefore, based on visual cues and consistency, it can be determined that the character wears a rust-orange jacket.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown in several scenarios with a snowboard under their feet. The snowboards are colorful and are depicted consistently beneath the character in various snowboarding poses. This is evidenced by the position and alignment of the snowboard in relation to the character's standing or squatting posture, suggesting that the snowboard is consistently shown under the character’s feet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown wearing a black helmet in the last row's first illustration. The character also has goggles that are tinted, but primarily seem to be of a reflective or varying color rather than distinctly red-tinted. Therefore, from the imagery available, while a black helmet is evident, the goggles do not clearly appear red-tinted across the various depictions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited images of Image B, the character is consistently portrayed with short black or dark brown hair. None of the illustrations show the character with long brown hair. The hair length and color remain consistent with short dark hair, often barely reaching the character's neck or remaining above it.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Throughout Image B, the character is shown wearing black pants in the different snowboarding illustrations. The color consistency in the illustrations indicates that the pants are depicted as black, which can be confirmed by looking at the consistent dark hue of the lower body attire worn by the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In every illustration of Image B, the character is fully visible with no body parts obscured or cut off. Each drawing is complete and shows the character in full, from head to toe, performing different actions such as snowboarding or interacting with the background elements. Thus, the character is fully visible in each image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is illustrated wearing black gloves in some scenes, notably in the lower row, where the character is shown snowboarding. The gloves are depicted in a dark hue consistent with the black color, particularly evident in the scenes where the character is actively engaged in winter sports.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B does not depict any snow-covered evergreen trees. Instead, the background consists of simple snowy landscapes or other elements without detailed depictions of evergreen trees with snow. As a result, the visuals do not support the presence of snow-covered evergreen trees in these illustrations.",
