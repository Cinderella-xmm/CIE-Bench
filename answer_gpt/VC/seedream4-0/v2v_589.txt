    "Question": "Q4: Do the nesting dolls reflect the elongated shape of the soccer cleat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls possess the classic rounded and cylindrical shape inherent to nesting dolls, without any elongation characteristics.

    "Question": "Q5: Do the nesting dolls incorporate the rounded shape of the tennis ball?",
    "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B exhibit a rounded shape, particularly at the top, which is a common feature of nesting dolls.
