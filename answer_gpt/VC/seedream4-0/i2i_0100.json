      "question": "Are the cabinet doors and drawers designed in a shaker style in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side view shows cabinet doors and drawers with a recessed panel, characterized by straight lines and a simple design, which is distinctive of the shaker style. The top-down view, despite being more abstract, follows the same uniform style with similar recessed paneling. This consistency indicates a shaker style throughout.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do both the top-down and side views show two rectangular sink basins with consistent dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's side view, there are two rectangular sink basins evident and positioned under two mirrors. In the top-down view, there is only one singular sink basin shown. This discrepancy in quantity and arrangement indicates inconsistency in dimensions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's side view, two black faucets are visible above each sink basin. The top-down view shows only one pair of faucets over a single sink basin. The orientation is identical in both views, but the quantity differs, showing a mismatch in consistency.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts light-colored marble countertops in both the side view and top-down rendering. The texture and color appear consistent in both views, suggesting that the countertop shares the same design material.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the compartments in the side view is a set of cabinets flanking drawers in a central position. The top-down view illustrates a similar setup with emphasis on the symmetrical distribution of cabinetry, consistently reflecting the original layout.",
