      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a large, fully bloomed white rose positioned in the bottom-right area of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-right area showcases a rose mosaic. The mosaic suggests a fully bloomed rose through the complete arrangement of petals but is stylized rather than a natural white rose. The edited image replaces natural elements with mosaic depictions, changing the original color and form. Initially assessing Image B, we see a mosaic style flower in the bottom right, which fits the representation of a fully bloomed white rose when comparing to Image A's natural rose. Thus, considering the complete arrangement of petals in mosaic form can be interpreted as mimicking the original fully bloomed flower.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a pointed arch window with decorative tracery visible on the upper part of the brick building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows architectural features in the upper part, with a visible pointed arch window characteristic of a distinctive outline and decorative tracery, which remain consistent from Image A to B. Without an apparent change to these architectural elements, the presence of such windows is indicative of Gothic or neo-gothic design, common knowledge regarding historical constructions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have a visible corner formed by two intersecting brick walls meeting at a right angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a building section is shown to have two walls coming together at a right angle. The tiles mimic the original red brick but maintain the architectural structure, including corner angles between construction segments as identified in Image A. Understanding common building styles and their geometric formations helps affirm the perception of right-angled intersections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct rose buds visible along the stems, including one with pink tips near the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B closely reveals numerous rose buds in the mosaic design along the stems. Direct observation indicates at least two to three buds distinct in form, even in a stylized representation. The differentiation by size and placement suggests more than one bud is visible. The inclusion of pink in certain buds parallels the natural mimicry, which upon comparing to Image A shows a realistic depiction with visible pink tips. This suggests Image B has enough detail to maintain such a characteristic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there dark green, serrated leaves present along the stems of the rose bush?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the flora is stylized in mosaic, leaves are present along the stems with darker green mosaics, indicating the intention to represent natural serrated leaves. When compared with Image A, which naturally contains these leaves, it displays continuity in visual narrative even when transformed into a mosaic form, maintaining accurate botanical characteristics from origin to rendition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the roses positioned in front of the brick building, creating a clear foreground-background separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains perspective with foreground roses against the backdrop building. The visual positioning demonstrates roses in the foreground through the mosaic representation, creating depth. Aligning this with Image Aâ€™s natural setting shows that architectural and botanical layers remain consistently separated, providing proper depth separation typical in a photographic composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a tall, vertical brick structure (buttress or tower) extending upward on the left side of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a vertical extension on the building's left side using mosaic tiles, creating the appearance of a tower or buttress. Image A's original structure also showcases such architectural features, verifying through vertical extensions common in large edifices. This feature remains distinct, affirming knowledge of typical architectural elements associated with historical buildings with vertical impressions.",
