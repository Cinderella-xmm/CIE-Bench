      "question": "Is the McLaren logo present on the front hood of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is enclosed in a glass display case, which allows a clear view of its front features. Observing the hood area closely, the McLaren logo is not visible or prominently displayed. Without the logo being apparent in Image B, this indicates its absence. In Image A, the McLaren logo is clearly seen on the front hood. Comparing both images, Image B lacks the McLaren logo visible in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the front headlights shaped as narrow, trapezoidal units with sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car's front headlights as narrow with trapezoidal shapes and sharp edges, which is characteristic of many modern sports cars. The design features clean lines and geometrical forms, consistent with the description. In Image A, the headlights continue to exhibit these characteristics, allowing a valid comparison. Therefore, the answer is affirmed by the visual shape and design evident.",

      "question": "Are red brake calipers visible behind the black multi-spoke wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels of the car are easy to observe. Behind the black multi-spoke wheels, red brake calipers are distinctly visible, contributing to the car's sporty appearance. Image A also confirms the presence of red brake calipers behind similar wheel designs, ensuring consistency between both images.",

      "question": "Is there a black angular side air intake vent running along the door line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a black angular side air intake vent running horizontally along the car's door line, enhancing its aerodynamics and styling. Image A shows a similar feature, validating the design choice consistently viewed in high-performance cars.",

      "question": "Is the car painted in a metallic silver finish with visible surface reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B exhibits a metallic silver paint finish, enhanced by visible reflections on its surface, suggesting a shiny and polished paint job. These reflections indicate a high level of craftsmanship typical of luxury sports cars. Comparing Image A further confirms its metallic silver appearance with similar reflective qualities, affirming the observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the car have a visible dihedral door line extending from the front fender to the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's design is scrutinized for this structural feature. The visible door line on the car suggests the presence of a dihedral door, as seen in many sports models, which typically run from the front fender towards the rear. However, upon careful observation, the specific door line characteristic of a dihedral door is not prominently visible, unlike what is typically expected. Comparing with Image A shows similar lines but does not confirm the dihedral door signature.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the car proportioned with a long front hood and short rear deck, characteristic of a mid-engine layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car with well-balanced proportions. The design features a relatively longer front end and a shorter rear, aligning with the characteristics of a mid-engine sports car layout. This gives the car a distinctive performance-oriented stance. Observing Image A, it mirrors these proportions, further confirming the mid-engine configuration.",
