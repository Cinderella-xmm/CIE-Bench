    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there exactly one tree positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B shows a single tree in a stained glass style, prominently displayed in the center. The geometric arrangement and clear division in the stained glass panel emphasize the presence of this one central tree. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree have a clearly defined layered canopy structure with multiple horizontal tiers of foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is depicted through stained glass artwork, which portrays multiple segments of foliage in distinct tiers. The geometric divisions represent different layers that mimic the tiered structure observed in real trees. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tree positioned in front of the mountain range in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass illustrates the tree in the foreground with mountain shapes distinctly placed behind it. This indicates that the tree is indeed positioned in front, based on the overlapping design elements and foreground-background composition. Thus, the answer is Yes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible shadow extending from the base of the tree onto the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass art style does not include elements like shadows, as the focus is on the geometric design and color segmentation. Shadows are not represented in this medium, and hence, the answer is No.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat grassy plain beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom portion of Image B depicts a flat area with greenish hues in the stained glass, suggestive of grass or a plain. This portrays the idea of a flat grassy terrain below the tree, and the geometric representation aligns with the world knowledge of grass plains. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there mountains visible in the background behind the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, behind the geometric portrayal of the tree, blue and brown triangular shapes are evident, symbolizing mountains. These are indicative of the mountain range that forms the backdrop in the stained glass representation. Thus, the answer is Yes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
