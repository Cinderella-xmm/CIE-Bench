      "question": "Does the edited image retain the three-masted structure of the ship, with one mast at the front, one in the center, and one at the rear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ship that is encased within a glass dome. It maintains the visible three-masted structure similar to many historical sailing ships. The positioning of masts follows the traditional arrangement with one near the bow, one towards the center, and one closer to the stern. My reasoning combines the visual cues from the image and common nautical knowledge about ship design.",

      "question": "Are the sails of the ship still dark blue in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails appear much lighter in color compared to Image A where they are dark blue. In the edited image, the sails have a more natural or light beige hue. Using color perception and comparing with typical sail color variations, it's evident there is a change from dark blue to light beige or white.",

      "question": "Is the bow of the ship decorated with intricate carvings and scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays a ship with intricate decorations along the bow. These decorations resemble carvings and scrollwork, common in historical ships known for ornate detailing. Observing closely, these details are consistent with styles from a bygone era that often featured embellished motifs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible portholes along the side of the shipâ€™s hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, if we look closely at the ship's hull, there are openings that resemble portholes. This visual cue, combined with knowledge about the structural design of traditional sailing ships, especially those meant for passenger transport like galleons, supports the presence of portholes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all three masts have multiple square sails stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, all three masts indeed show multiple square sails stacked one over the other, maintaining a distinct tall layering style that is typical of square-rigged ships. This verification comes from observing the sail arrangement and recognizing common practices in historical sailing vessels.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a ship that retains a narrow hull with a tall appearance, along with a pointed bow, maintaining the original silhouette seen in Image A. This follows historical ship designs often made narrow for speed and sharp to cut through water more effectively.",
