    "Question": "Q1: Does the zebra retain its black-and-white stripe pattern without significant alteration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the zebra still has a stripe pattern, the material appears to have been altered to look metallic or reflective, which is a significant change from the typical natural appearance. From examining the visual cues, the zebra's surface reflects light in a way that resembles metal, not fur, indicating an alteration. In Image A, we can recognize the zebraâ€™s stripes as natural black-and-white without reflective qualities. Comparatively, the zebra in Image B has experienced significant visual changes in terms of texture and appearance, despite the stripes being present.",
