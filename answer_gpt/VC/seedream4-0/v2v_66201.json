      "question": "Is the monkey's face and expression clearly visible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monkey's face is intentionally covered and not clearly visible. The covering suggests an alteration that prevents distortion assessment. Therefore, the monkey's face and expression are not visible or assessable.",

      "question": "Does the background still feature a spiral galaxy with stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background retains the visual elements of a night sky, including a prominent spiral galaxy and multiple stars, similar to Image A. This suggests that the background remains mostly unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the alterations around the monkey's body due to the dust-like effect, the posture, including the upward extension of the tail, remains recognizable and similar to that in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the brass scientific instrument on the table in front of the monkey, consistent with its position in Image A. The instrument is untouched by the dust effect, confirming its continued presence.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though there's a transformative effect around the monkey in Image B, the wooden surface beneath the brass instrument remains visible and unchanged, similar to Image A.",
