      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a manga-style scene where a cat character interacts with a bag character. The bag in Image B is drawn with the same earthy tones and brown leather straps as seen in Image A. This is evident from the coloring and design consistency in the manga representation. Comparing the two images confirms that the visual style has been maintained in terms of color and materials.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag character's structure is consistent with detailed aspects from Image A. The visible stitching along the sides of the bag is illustrated in the manga panel, indicating attention to detail and consistency with the original imageâ€™s design aspects.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl character is seen as a manga representation alongside the cat and bag character. It retains its white color and is drawn in a similar shape to Image A, reminding us of a plain white bowl. Although it now has legs and interacts actively, the color and basic shape are maintained, showing consistency from the original image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a wooden floor as background, consistent in color and texture with the floor in Image A. The illustration in both manga panels maintains the wood grain appearance, suggesting continuity of the interior setting, which helps to establish familiarity and context between the objects and characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bag and bowl are adjacent on the wooden floor. Image B shows them still near each other in both panels, as the interactions between the cat character and the objects occur in close proximity. The similarity in placement is evident through both images, providing a seamless transition between real-life depiction and animated narrative.",
