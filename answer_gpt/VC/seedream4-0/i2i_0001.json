        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is designed with a distinct stylized pearl earring on her left ear.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character wearing a style of headscarf that has been distinctly designed in two colors, blue and yellow, which are easily identifiable.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is depicted wearing a brightly colored garment, styled similarly to what could be considered a coat or dress, in a yellow hue along with a striking white collar.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
