    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the woman's facial structure, including her eyes, nose, and mouth, preserved in their original form and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face features the characteristics typical of chibi art style with exaggerated large eyes and a small, simplified mouth and nose, differing significantly from realistic proportions in traditional portraits. In chibi art, facial features are simplified and not positioned according to realistic human anatomy. Therefore, comparing to a more realistically styled portrait in Image A, the facial structure in Image B is not preserved. Thus, the positioning and form are altered from realistic proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark hair arranged in an updo with a blue ribbon placed on the left side of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman has dark hair styled in an updo with a blue ribbon noticeable, but it appears on the upper part of her head rather than distinctly on the left side. Considering common positioning descriptions, being 'on the left side' typically implies the ribbon is discernibly placed marginally more on one side of the head. Given the displayed central positioning of the ribbon in Image B, the specific description does not align.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dress designed with an off-the-shoulder neckline that exposes the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman in a dress that has the hallmarks of an off-the-shoulder neckline, which means the shoulder area is uncovered by cloth, displaying the aesthetic style. Through the dress visual features, this confirms the shoulders are revealed in the design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a golden necklace with a pendant visible around the woman’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted wearing a golden necklace that includes a round decorative element, which serves as a pendant. The necklace's design and placement affirm its presence around her neck. Despite rendering simplification, the pendant form is clear.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a ring visible on the woman’s right hand, specifically on the ring finger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a ring is indeed present on the ring finger of the woman's right hand. Observing the right hand from a proper anatomical position, the ring adorns the designated finger correctly, consistent with traditional ring naming conventions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a heraldic crest in the upper-right corner. It maintains a red-and-gold color scheme, mimicking traditional heraldic symbols. This visual placement and color scheme make it distinctly noticeable in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the woman seated with her arms crossed across her chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the woman with hands resting on her lap, not crossed in front of her chest. Traditional descriptions of crossed arms involve positioning them horizontally in a defensive or closed posture over the upper chest, which is not observed here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's eyes are indeed depicted as open and drawn to face forward directly, resembling a gaze toward the viewer. This stylistic direction is common in chibi representations to convey engagement or attentiveness.",
