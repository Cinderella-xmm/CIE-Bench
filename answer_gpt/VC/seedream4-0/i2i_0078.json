        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch exhibits a design consisting of black and silver elements.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual examination of Image B shows the watch's face remains white, with prominent black hour markers. This color combination, known for its high contrast and typical design in watches, aids in the ease of time reading.

      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the metallic bracelet of the watch, characterized by its silver hue and shiny surface. This type of bracelet is commonly used in high-quality watches for durability and aesthetic appeal. The analysis shows no alteration to this feature in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the wristwatch on what appears to be the same white surface as seen in Image A. While the background setting has changed, the watch's position relative to the surface remains constant. This is evident from the consistent angle and layout of the watch in both images.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the watch with lighting and shadow patterns that are slightly modified, indicating the editing impacts. Although the watch's surface and position remain unaltered, shifts in background context in Image B slightly alter the distribution of light and shadow on the object. Recognizing subtle differences in illumination and shadow placement indicates changes.",
