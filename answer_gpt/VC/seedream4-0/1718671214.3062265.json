      "question": "Is the metallic mask with horn-like protrusions at the temples present and retaining its original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region where the face and mask should be is blurred, preventing any analysis of the presence or the shape of the metallic mask. Without visible cues, it cannot be determined whether the mask is present or its shape is retained. Therefore, the answer is based on the fact that no mask can be distinguished in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red lips and visible lower face (including chin and jawline) clearly present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the lips and lower face would typically be is blurred, making it impossible to discern any details about the lips or the chin and jawline. With no clear visual information about these features, it cannot be confirmed that they are present and unchanged.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black hair styled in an updo with floral branches positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black hair is styled in an updo, and floral branches are seen positioned symmetrically on both sides of the head. This arrangement matches expectations for such a hairstyle, supporting a conclusion of symmetry based on both the spatial arrangement and common hair styling practices.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are cherry blossom branches visibly integrated into the hair on both sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the presence of floral branches integrated into the hair on both sides of the head. These branches resemble cherry blossoms due to their pink color and clustered appearance, consistent with common depictions of cherry blossoms.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subjectâ€™s facial skin tone fair and uniformly lit, matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial area is blurred, preventing any assessment of skin tone or lighting conditions. Thus, without clear visibility, it cannot be confirmed that the skin tone is fair, uniformly lit, or matches any original.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a symmetrical pose and centered composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair and floral arrangement suggest a direct forward-facing position with symmetry and centered composition. This conclusion is based on the positioning of the hair and accessories, which align with expectations for a centered and symmetrical look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the mask retain a textured, metallic surface appearance rather than becoming smooth or cartoonish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the mask area in Image B is blurred, no textured, metallic surface appearance can be confirmed. Without visibility of the mask, there is no evidence to determine its surface appearance.",
