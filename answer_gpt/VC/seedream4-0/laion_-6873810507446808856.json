      "question": "Are there two vertically stacked pancake layers, with the bottom one slightly larger than the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two pancake characters are depicted side by side rather than stacked. On the left, the pancake character consists of multiple layers stacked vertically, but this is different in context from what Image A depicts, where there are clearly only two pancakes stacked vertically. In Image B, the narrative and anthropomorphic design focus on creating a story with characters, so the literal stacking is altered into a narrative design rather than a literal food stack as seen in Image A. Therefore, the structure does not maintain the same layout as described in the question.",

      "question": "Do the pancakes retain a dominant golden-yellow color throughout their visible surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents pancakes that are animated and heavily stylized with a golden-yellow color, emphasizing a cartoonish and lively theme. This color choice mimics the typical appearance of pancakes, helping to convey their identity easily within the animated context. In comparison, Image A also clearly depicts pancakes with a golden color typical for cooked pancakes. Despite the artistic alterations in Image B, the color integrity is maintained, focusing on their recognizably golden-yellow hue consistent with real pancakes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a solid, rectangular pat of pale yellow butter placed on the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animated depiction includes a clear pat of butter on top of the multilayered pancake character, maintaining its classic representation even in a fictional, animated form. This resembles the actual lifestyle practice and design evident in Image A, where a simple rectangular butter pat is traditionally positioned atop the pancakes. The depiction in both images involves butter to clearly signify their identity as pancakes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible stream of amber-colored syrup flowing from a pitcher onto the pancakes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the syrup flows as a large cascade over a pancake character who is joyfully swimming in it, dramatically enlarged and highlighted compared to simple syrup pouring. This animated style elevates the syrup into an active participant of the scene, contrasting with Image A's more straightforward depiction of syrup gently cascading down the pancake stack. Despite stylistic differences, the function and portrayal of flowing syrup remain central to both images, though in Image B, it is part of the world-building rather than just a pour onto the pancakes.",

      "question": "Is the pancake stack placed on a white plate with a light blue rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a typical breakfast setting with pancakes and accompanying foods on a plate, but the presence of a light blue rim is absent or not accentuated due to the image's cartoon style and the full view of the scene. Image A's distinct plate design with blue edging is part of a realistic presentation focus. Image B prioritizes character and narrative over plate detailing, and thus provides no significant emphasis or existence of a blue-rimmed plate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the inner sides of the pancakes visibly porous and airy, showing a spongy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B does not specifically highlight the internal texture of the pancakes in an explicit manner as Image A does. Instead, the imagery focuses on character and interaction, leaving textual and structural details of the pancakes depicted more abstractly. The key intent is on creating an engaging animated scene rather than showcasing food texture with the same realism as in Image A, where airiness and porous structures are more naturally depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream originate from above the stack and flow downward onto the top pancake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the syrup forms a river-like cascade where a pancake character is seen enjoying the syrup flow. Here, the pour isn't from directly above the pancake stack, but rather given a fantastical narrative, as the syrup is incorporated into creating a dynamic setting. Image A, however, depicts syrup being traditionally poured from a straightforward, gravity-driven direction above the pancakes. The imaginative reinterpretation in Image B alters the syrup pour into an animated flow beyond traditional constraints.",
