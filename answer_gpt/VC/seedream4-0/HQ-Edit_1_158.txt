    "Question": "Q1: Is the woman’s silver hair clearly visible and styled in a short, neat manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair is represented in a simplified paper cut-out style, which does not capture details such as texture or styling specifics like neatness. Instead, the hair is depicted as an outline consistent with paper art. By contrast, Image A shows clearly visible silver hair styled in a short, neat manner. Therefore, the edited image does not clearly express these details.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are both hands visibly holding the open book, with fingers wrapped around the edges of the pages?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses cut-out paper shapes to represent the woman holding a book. The paper shapes show both hands holding the book, but due to the nature of paper art, there are no visible fingers wrapped around the edges of pages as one would expect in natural imagery.
