    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small fan inside a snow globe. This fan has three blades attached to a central hub, resembling a standard desk fan rather than a ceiling fan. In contrast, Image A features a ceiling fan with four distinct and larger blades. Therefore, the edited image does not retain the original four blades of the ceiling fan, as it features a fan with only three blades.",
    "answer": "no"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the central hub structure of the ceiling fan still present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fan's central hub resembles that of a small desk fan, typical in snow globes or decorative small fans, suggesting a more simplistic and smaller hub compared to the central hub of the ceiling fan in Image A. The original central hub structure of the ceiling fan is replaced by this different structure, appropriate for the smaller fan in the snow globe.",
    "answer": "no"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the ceiling fan?",
    "explanation": "The small fan inside the snow globe in Image B shows a lighter, more toy-like texture, often seen in decorative or cartoon-styled objects. It has colors that are softer, usually pastel or neutral. In Image A, the ceiling fan is metallic with a stainless steel texture and color. Therefore, the edited image does not preserve the metallic texture and color scheme of the original ceiling fan.",
    "answer": "no"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the blades arranged symmetrically around the central hub in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Both Image A (original) and Image B (edited) feature fans with symmetrically arranged blades around their respective central hubs. Despite the reduction in the number of blades in Image B, the three blades of the small fan are equally spaced around the central hub, maintaining symmetry.",
    "answer": "yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the connection points between the blades and the central hub visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the connection points between the fan blades and the central hub are visible, reflecting a basic desk fan design where the blades attach clearly and distinctly to a central circular hub. This visibility is similar to Image A, where the connection points are clearly defined on the ceiling fan's hub.",
    "answer": "yes"
