    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the recognizable coastline shape of North and South America, including the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow isthmus of Central America?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coastline of North and South America is clearly visible on the map depicted, with identifiable features like the Gulf of Mexico and the narrow isthmus of Central America. This is discerned from the distinct shape and positioning of the continents on the parchment map, which are recognizable forms from common geographical knowledge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the latitude and longitude grid lines still visible or clearly implied in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map retains the grid system typical of latitude and longitude lines, which is visible as intersections of lines that form a uniform pattern over the map. This is indicative of traditional navigation maps and matches the common representation of these geographical markers.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the aged parchment texture, including stains and discoloration, preserved in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a map with an aged appearance; the texture of the parchment including stains and discoloration is evident. This gives the map an antique look, consistent with historical navigation charts, and suggests preservation of these details from the original image.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features sepia tones across the map and parchment, gold is present in the ship’s wheel, and slight green detailing can be seen, reinforcing the preservation of the original color palette as dominant hues seen within these elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains handwritten script labels and ship illustrations on the map. These elements are part of the detailed decor of the map surface, providing visual interest and context. Their presence suggests that the image retains original detailed features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship’s wheel is rendered with a golden metallic finish similar to that of Image A's compass. The intricate pattern detailing on the wheel matches the style originally found on the compass, indicating a consistent thematic and stylistic transition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the map corresponds with the northern direction as visible from the layout of the continents and common navigational orientation norms. This matches typical map orientation where North is directed upwards.",
