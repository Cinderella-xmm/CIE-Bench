      "question": "Is the flowing brown and gray marbled pattern visible on the surfaces of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks exhibit a surface pattern that closely resembles marble. The pattern comprises irregular brown and gray veins that flow across the surface of the bricks. This marbled appearance is created by the distinct coloration and texture visible in the image, which matches common characteristics of marble patterns, providing the impression of natural stone. The visual cues in Image B clearly show the presence of such a pattern, indicating that the bricks do indeed have a flowing marbled pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks rendered with a white base color accented by warm brown and gray marbling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are visually depicted with a primary white base color. Upon close observation, it can be seen that these white bases are accented by patterns that are comprised of warm brown and gray marbling. This observation is based on the blending of these accent colors with the white, which emulates a natural marble effect and enhances the aesthetic of the bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the marbled veins follow an organic, irregular flow rather than a geometric or repetitive pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the veins in the marbling seen on the LEGO bricks exhibit a flow that appears organic and irregular. This is characterized by the non-linear and varying path of the marbling, akin to the natural formation of marble, which does not follow a predictable or repetitive pattern. This irregularity is a key characteristic of natural stone marbling and suggests an organic flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both warm brown and gray veins present together in the marbled pattern of the LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual detailing on the LEGO bricks shows marbled patterns that incorporate both warm brown and gray veins. These are distinctly visible as intertwined elements within the marbling effect on the surfaces, indicating the presence of multiple colors that contribute to the marble-like appearance of the bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks visually appear to be made of a marble-like material based on their surface pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B makes use of a pattern and coloration on the LEGO bricks that mimics the look of marble. The combination of white, along with the brown and gray marbling, creates a visual suggestion of a marble-like texture. This resemblance is achieved not by altering the actual material of the bricks but purely through the visual depiction of a marbled pattern, giving the appearance of marble.",
