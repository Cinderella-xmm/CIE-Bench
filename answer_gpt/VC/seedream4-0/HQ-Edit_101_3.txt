    "Question": "Q5: Are the bird’s feet orange-yellow in color?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not explicitly show the bird's feet, as its feet are either not illustrated or not visible due to the style of the packaging design.

    "Question": "Q6: Are the bird’s feet positioned as if gripping a branch?",
