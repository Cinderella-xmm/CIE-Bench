    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the trunk of each elephant still curved upward in the same manner as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both elephant trunks are still curved upward, similar to how trunks commonly depict in decorative items to symbolize good luck and positive energy. Comparing this with Image A, where the elephants' trunks are also curved upward, the pattern remains consistent in both images, indicating the style has been retained.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ears of both elephants still present in their original flared shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the ears of the elephants are flared and positioned outward, similar to Image A, where the ears are large and prominently flared. These elements often serve aesthetic or symbolic purposes in artistic representations of elephants.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the oval-shaped mosaic pattern located on the back of each elephant, centered and bordered by gold trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pattern on the elephants is comprised of mosaic squares that cover the entire body, rather than being an oval shape on the back with gold bordering as seen in Image A. The design has changed significantly between the two images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both elephants retain golden-colored tusks positioned near the mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden tusks are seen near the mouth of each elephant, consistent with artistic representations using gold to accentuate features like tusks. Comparing with Image A, where the tusks are similarly colored and positioned near the mouth, this detail remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a decorative band with scrollwork pattern around the lower body of each elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a decorative scrollwork band around the lower body, focusing instead on the mosaic design covering the body. Image A includes a band with scrollwork pattern clearly visible. Thus, this aspect has changed significantly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the eyes of both elephants positioned on the sides of the head and colored dark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephants feature eyes colored dark and positioned on the sides of their heads, a typical placement for elephant depictions. Image A also presents these characteristics, maintaining the realistic side-positioning of elephant eyes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the larger elephant positioned to the left and the smaller one to the right, maintaining their original relative size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although there are two elephants represented, they are positioned differently as part of a rounded bottle shape; in Image A, the larger elephant is indeed on the left and the smaller on the right. Thus, Image B does not maintain the same positioning.",
