    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass bulb shaped like a teardrop with visible internal filaments present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bulb is designed with a cartoonish appearance, fitting the style of the illustration. The recognizable shape of a light bulb transforms into a character with a face, arms, and legs. This playful presentation alters the typical teardrop form we associate with standard bulbs. While there are internal filament-like details drawn in a whimsical style, they do not resemble realistic filaments due to the illustration's artistic style. Thus, the standard teardrop shape with clear filaments is not present.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the curved vertical bars forming a cage-like structure around the bulb present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are curved vertical elements depicted around the bulb character, resembling a cage. While they mimic the original cage-like structure depicted in Image A, they serve more as creative limbs for the character, enhancing its playful and animated depiction. This artistic representation implies the presence of a similar structure, but it is used in a fictional and comic context.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dark cylindrical housing at the top of the fixture with a visible screw detail present?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a dark cylindrical top attached to our animated bulb character, reminiscent of the fixture in Image A. This representation stylizes the fixture into a character feature, hinting at mechanical elements such as screws in a simplified comic form. While the exact screw details are not as pronounced due to the artistic style, the design hints at their presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the circular cap at the bottom of the metal cage present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animated bulb has a rounded bottom that introduces legs as part of its character design, rather than a distinct circular cap seen in traditional bulb fixtures. This portrayal diverges from the precise bottom cap structure of Image A, using creative elements to suggest movement instead of static fixture parts.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the glass bulb positioned centrally within the metal cage?",
    "explanation": "In the second image, the bulb is anthropomorphized, taking on a central role within the illustration's scene. While there is a cage-like effect created by the character's arms, the whole design is part of a unified character rather than a practical fixture. Thus, while the bulb form is central, it's not within a separate cage in a literal sense.",
    "answer": "No"
