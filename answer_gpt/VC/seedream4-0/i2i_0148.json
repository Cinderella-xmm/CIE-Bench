      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two cars in the image identifiable as the same models shown in the original, with the same body shapes and design features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both cars retain the same design features and body shapes as seen in Image A. This is determined by the distinctive rear lights, vehicle contours, and visible manufacturer logos, indicating that they are the same models. Identifying vehicle models involves recognizing unique features such as body lines and light configurations, which remain unchanged in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red traffic lights still visible above the cars, maintaining their original function as stop signals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red traffic lights are clearly visible above the cars, indicating that they are actively serving their purpose as stop signals. This can be determined by the illuminated, bright red color of the lights, consistent with their function in any urban environment. Comparing both images, the positioning and function of the traffic lights are unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lane markings on the road clearly visible and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lane markings on the road are clearly visible and remain consistent with those in Image A. The white markings delineate the lanes and direct vehicle alignment, crucial for traffic organization. Visual comparison shows no change in these road features between both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the urban environment around the cars intact, including trees and roadside features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the urban environment surrounding the cars, including trees and roadside features, remain intact as seen in Image A. This is determined by the presence of blurred natural elements and road features in the background, indicating an unchanged environment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both cars still positioned parallel to each other, maintaining their original placement on the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two cars are positioned parallel to each other as observed in Image A. This is concluded from the alignment of the vehicles in relation to the lane markings and the road, suggesting that there is no shift in their parallel placement.",
