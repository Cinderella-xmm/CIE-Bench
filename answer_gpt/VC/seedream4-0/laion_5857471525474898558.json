      "question": "Are the windows aligned vertically in the same columns across all floors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the building is designed with windows that visually appear to be aligned vertically in the same columns across all floors. This alignment is consistent with standard architectural practices for symmetry and balance. By examining the visual structure, we can see that each set of windows is positioned one directly above the other without offset.",

      "question": "Is there a red door located on the left side of the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the front facade of the building. On the ground floor, there is indeed a red door clearly visible on the left side. The red color is distinct against the surrounding structures, making it easy to identify.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark-colored door located on the right side of the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the ground floor, there is a door on the right side of the facade that is dark in color. This is distinguished from the left-side red door by the tone and contrast against the building facade.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the climbing plant cover the central vertical strip of the building, spanning from near the ground floor up to the third floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building is depicted as having an appearance of being made from Lego-like bricks, with a representation of a climbing plant that runs along the central vertical strip of the building facade. This plant stretches from near the ground floor, moving upward and appearing to cover multiple floors, which includes spanning up to the third floor.",

      "question": "Is there a red rectangular outline enclosing a section of the building that includes three stacked windows and a balcony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the building is modified to appear like it's constructed from toy bricks. There is no red rectangular outline present in this depiction like in Image A, which includes highlighted features such as windows and a balcony. The absence of any such outline is clear when observing Image B due to its uniform building facade.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the balconies located directly outside specific windows on the second, third, and fourth floors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, balconies are indeed present on the building's facade, positioned directly outside specific windows. The uniform pattern suggests these balconies align with windows on the second, third, and fourth floors, consistent with a typical multi-story building design where balconies provide outdoor access from adjacent rooms.",
