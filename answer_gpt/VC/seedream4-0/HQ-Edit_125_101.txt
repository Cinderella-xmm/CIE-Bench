    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer depicted in an arabesque leap with one leg extended behind and arms forming a diagonal line?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer inside the snow globe stands on one leg, with the other lifted, but it does not resemble an arabesque leap typical in ballet, where one leg is fully extended behind the dancer. The arms also do not form the common diagonal line of an arabesque. Instead, they appear more gracefully posed as a dancer might when performing in a snow globe rather than leaping.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the Eiffel Tower retain its characteristic iron lattice structure and three-tiered design with a spire at the top?",
    "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower in Image B is depicted as a miniature model inside the snow globe. It maintains the recognizable features of the actual Eiffel Tower, including the iron lattice, three-tiered design, and spire at the top, even though it is a small-scale representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are both feet of the dancer wearing pointe shoes with visible ribbons and box-like structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer depicted as a statue inside the snow globe wears what appears to be pointe shoes. However, given the statue's small scale and material, the detailed structure such as visible ribbons and box-like detail characteristic of pointe shoes might be simplified or not clearly visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the dancerâ€™s head turned to face the Eiffel Tower, indicating forward gaze toward it?",
    "explanation": "The dancer in Image B, portrayed as a figurine in the snow globe, has a head position that suggests a forward gaze and poised pose, rather than a deliberate turn towards the Eiffel Tower within the globe.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the dancer wearing a leotard that is predominantly turquoise in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is a bronze figurine, so the color is not rendered in turquoise or any specific color but instead retains the bronze coloration typical of a metallic statue. Therefore, the leotard is not turquoise.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, clearly in front of the Eiffel Tower?",
    "explanation": "The dancer in Image B, encapsulated within the snow globe, appears to be positioned beside the Eiffel Tower model and not spatially in the foreground in a typical outside environment. In a snow globe, spatial positioning is compact and designed for aesthetic presentation rather than accurate spatial representation.",
    "answer": "No"
