      "question": "Are the broccoli florets in both dishes still composed of distinct tree-like branching structures with dark green crowns and lighter green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the broccoli retains its tree-like structure. The typical structure of broccoli includes a branching stem with a dense, dark green crown, which is present in both dishes, although the right dish's broccoli appears more charred, the structure is still discernible. This characteristic distinguishes broccoli, known for its tree-like appearance.",

      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their compact, rounded, and textured white clusters regardless of size?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cauliflower in the left dish maintains the classic shape of closely packed, textured white clusters, which are characteristics of cauliflower. Despite any changes in color due to slight cooking reactions, the overall structure remains recognizable as cauliflower.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the vegetables in the left dish still bright green (broccoli) and creamy white (cauliflower), without any browning or charring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the vegetables in the left dish show signs of slight discoloration—they are not as vibrant as fresh vegetables. The broccoli and cauliflower are less bright, with the cauliflower having some brown patches, indicating possible cooking or oxidation effects. Therefore, they are not bright without any browning.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli in the right dish indeed shows evidence of a darker level of cooking. The edges possess a more charred, almost black appearance alongside some areas of golden-brown, confirming extensive caramelization and charring.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays both dishes clearly as rectangular, having handles at the top and bottom. They appear consistent in material and design, looking like they are made of white ceramic. This is evident from the typical sheen and appearance of ceramic material.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left dish contains the less cooked or raw vegetables, while the right dish contains what appears to be roasted vegetables. This arrangement aligns with typical kitchen practices of comparing raw and cooked states of the same ingredients side by side.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B closely, there are distinct dark browning marks and possible seasoning specks noticeable within the right dish around the roasted vegetables. Such marks are typically the result of roasting and seasoning processes, leading to caramelization and char.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to be coming from directly above, giving an even exposure across the image. The shadows under the dishes and vegetables are moderated, indicating minimal lateral light sources, contributing to uniform illumination.",
