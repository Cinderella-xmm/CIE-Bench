    "Question": "Q1: Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings are part of a miniature, with visible dark wooden beams creating geometric patterns characteristic of traditional half-timbered architecture, but they do not appear structurally accurate due to the small scale and the artistic representation in the model, deviating from realistic proportions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while there are steeply pitched gabled roofs, the presence of dormer windows positioned at regular intervals is not clearly visible. The miniature representation may omit such details to a realistic extent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a miniature representation of a pedestrian bridge in the mid-ground connecting the two sides of the canal. The bridge is visible, supporting the function of connecting both streets.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the canal's reflection does not show a mirror-like fidelity due to its representation in a miniature rather than a real water body, making the reflections less likely to be clear and mirror-like.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings being a part of a miniature diorama do include details like flower boxes with green plants along the balconies, albeit possibly represented in a simplified manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while there is detail along the canal edges likely resembling stone bases, the inclusion of metal railings is not discernible in this miniature representation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, since the scene is a scaled-down representation of the original, the windows match the classic half-timbered style but do not perfectly follow the realistic vertical and horizontal alignment, deviating due to the miniature scale.",
    "answer": "No"
