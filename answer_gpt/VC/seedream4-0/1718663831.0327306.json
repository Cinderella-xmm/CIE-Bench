        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest that the fur on the dog, which resembles a plush toy or model, is primarily white.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the animal suggests a rounded head with pointed ears. The muzzle is not distinctly visible due to the blur, but based on the overall form and typical characteristics of small toy dogs, the animal likely has a short muzzle, which is common for this style of plush toy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any indication of sunglasses on the dog. It is seated upright without any visible accessories on its face. The animal also seems to be impersonating a plush toy or model, which commonly does not include sunglasses as part of its typical appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is indeed seated upright and positioned directly facing forward. This posture is typical for small plush toys where they are often designed to sit upright on surfaces, facing directly forward for display purposes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the plush animal with a compact and small body structure typical of plush toys. The visible form suggests short legs and a conspicuously fluffy tail. The plush toy's design is intended to emulate a compact, toy-like appearance, aligning with these physical characteristics.",
