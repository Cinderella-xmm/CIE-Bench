    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible wooden ceiling beams as the image is of an underwater scene with a jellyfish. Image A does feature ceiling beams as it shows an indoor setting with a hanging lantern. Comparing this to Image B, the absence of such a setting means that these beams are not present or positioned in any form as they are in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is underwater, focusing on a jellyfish, and does not feature any walls. Image A has a clearly defined indoor wall with texture, but such architectural elements do not exist in Image B's underwater context.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is of an underwater scene with a jellyfish and does not include any shadows or patterns that resemble those from a lantern. Image A shows complex shadow patterns due to the lantern's design, which are absent from the jellyfish-centered image in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the corner where the white wall meets the wooden ceiling clearly visible, forming a sharp right-angle edge at the upper left portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B depicts an underwater scene with a focus on a jellyfish, there is no architectural element like walls or ceilings present to form a corner as described. Image A features this architectural feature, but such a corner is irrelevant in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal chain, consisting of small linked rings, visibly connecting the top of the lantern to the ceiling fixture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on a jellyfish in an underwater setting, without any signs of a lantern or metal chain. Image A shows a metal chain for a hanging lantern, but this context does not apply to Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the light emanate from within the central chamber of the lantern, creating a bright focal point that radiates outward through the perforated panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene involved is underwater with a jellyfish, not featuring any lantern or light source with perforated panels as does Image A. Since there is no lantern in Image B, such a lighting effect cannot be present.",
