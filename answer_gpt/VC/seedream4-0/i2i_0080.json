      "question": "Does the dog retain its reddish-brown fur in both the left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog shown in the top left and top right views, as well as the bottom view, consistently has reddish-brown fur. The fur color is clearly depicted and is uniform across all visible angles of the dog, indicating no change in its appearance. Using world knowledge on visual continuity in illustrations, we conclude that the dog retains the same reddish-brown fur in both the side and back views.",

      "question": "Are the dog’s floppy ears present and maintained in shape in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog’s floppy ears are visible in all the views presented - the left side, the right side, and the front. The ears maintain their distinctive floppy shape across these views. Drawing from world knowledge of cartoon dogs and consistency in animated character features, the ears are consistently illustrated without modifications in each viewpoint.",

      "question": "Is the dog wearing a red collar with a tag in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, regardless of the viewpoint (top left, top right, and bottom images), the dog is shown wearing a red collar with a tag. The collar is visually identifiable due to its color contrast against the dog's fur and its presence is consistent across different angles. World knowledge suggests collars and tags are common details in pet illustrations that remain unchanged to maintain character continuity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted lying on a wooden bed with a green mattress and pillow across all views (both top views and the bottom view). The bed’s wooden frame is visually consistent, as are the green bedding elements. World knowledge informs us that illustration detail continuity is key for recognition, and there’s no change in this setup across the views seen.",

      "question": "Is the dog’s bed set against a pale blue background with green grass around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background surrounding the dog’s bed across all views is pale blue with visible patches of green grass, aligning with the same setting characteristics. World knowledge about cartoon settings suggest these colors and elements ensure a simple and consistent environment. Thus, there is no variation in the background setting.",
