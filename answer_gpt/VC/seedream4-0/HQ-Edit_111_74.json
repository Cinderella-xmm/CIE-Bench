      "question": "Is the floral embroidery on the kimono located along the sleeve and lower back in the same pattern layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral embroidery on the kimono can be observed in intricate gold patterns along the sleeve and continues along the lower back area. Comparing with Image A which also features similar embroidery across the same regions, the pattern is maintained consistently in both images. Thus, they share the same pattern layout based on visible cues.",
