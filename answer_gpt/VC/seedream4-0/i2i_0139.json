      "question": "Is the carrot still bright orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is clearly visible and maintains a vibrant, bright orange hue. This is evident from the saturation and hue of the carrot compared to common natural appearances of carrots. The lighting in the indoor environment doesn't overshadow the color, which distinguishes the carrot's vividness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carrot maintain its conical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the carrot retains its characteristic conical shape. This is indicated by the broad top tapering down toward a narrower end, consistent with the typical geometry found in naturally grown carrots.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the green leaves still present at the top of the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot has green leafy tops that are visibly healthy and attached. These leaves are similar to carrot tops which commonly grow above ground, further confirmed by their fresh green color and upward growth pattern.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tapered top end of the carrot with visible roots still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrot with the top portion where it connects to the leaves. There are remnants of small root strands protruding from the carrot's upper section. These visual details are indicative of the real carrotâ€™s anatomy where roots usually converge before the start of the wider section.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carrot still positioned upright in the substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is positioned upright, but it's not in soil; it is placed inside a high-tech environment on a platform. Despite being removed from natural soil into a different medium, likely for controlled growth or demonstration, the orientation remains upright, maintaining the typical orientation seen during growth or display.",
