      "question": "Is the chair supported by a five-star base with exactly five legs, each ending in a caster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair's base is visible, showcasing a typical five-star base design. Each leg terminates in a caster, which is common for office chairs, allowing mobility. Analyzing the base, we observe that it has precisely five legs, all equipped with casters, confirming the portability feature. This aligns with typical office chair designs, which often use such a structure to maintain balance and offer movement flexibility.",

      "question": "Is there a separate headrest cushion positioned directly above the main backrest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a LEGO version of a chair. The headrest, constructed from LEGO pieces, sits distinctly above the main backrest, suggesting separation. The positioning indicates that it's designed as a separate component rather than a continuous part of the backrest. This configuration is typical in executive-style chairs, providing additional neck support.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two armrests, one on each side, extending horizontally from the chairâ€™s midsection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the chair features two armrests constructed from LEGO bricks extending from the middle section of the chair, horizontally on each side. Such a design is common in office chairs, offering users comfort and support for their arms when seated.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the backrest vertically aligned behind the seat, rising from the same central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the chair's backrest is LEGO-constructed and rises directly upward from where the seat is located. This vertical alignment behind the seat is a typical design for ergonomic chairs, ensuring support for the user's back along the same axis from seat to backrest for stability.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chair maintain a tall, high-back silhouette with the headrest significantly higher than the seat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chair that possesses a tall, high-back design made of LEGO, with the headrest placed above the backrest, significantly higher than the seat. This characteristic creates a prominent silhouette, often associated with executive office chairs, which have taller backrests for added support. The positioning of the headrest indicates its purpose to cater to taller users, providing comfort beyond the mid-back.",
