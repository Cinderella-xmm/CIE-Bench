      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed character's surface retains the wood pattern seen on the two drawers.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the circular brass ring pulls and adjacent escutcheons present on the transformed character’s waist area, matching their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the transformed character with the circular brass ring pulls and escutcheons maintained on the two drawers, which form part of the central body. Since they match the original positions shown in Image A on the drawers, they are evident on the transformed character.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs have been replaced by clawed feet without any visible brass caps, diverging from the original cabinet in Image A which has brass caps at the ends of the tapered legs. This indicates a transformation rather than a retention of the original features.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation in Image B has replaced the tapered legs with clawed feet, which are not consistent with the original cabinet legs found in Image A, indicating a significant alteration in this aspect of the design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed character in Image B exhibits the two drawers stacked vertically, one above the other, similar to their configuration in Image A. This alignment suggests continuity from the original cabinet design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the brass foliate motif visible on the side of the transformed character’s torso, in the same location as the original cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed character in Image B shows an extended claw-like arm and fancy attire which likely covers the area where the brass foliate motif initially appeared in Image A. Thus, the brass ornament is no longer visibly present.",
