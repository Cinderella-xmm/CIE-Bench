      "question": "Is the rosette badge with the text \"GRAND CHAMPION\" and black-and-white ribbon design still present on the chest of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual is seen wearing a costume with floral patterns and a cape. Despite this transformation, the rosette badge is clearly visible on the individual's chest, with the text 'GRAND CHAMPION' and a black-and-white design, which stands out against the bright costume. Comparing this with Image A, the rosette is also present on the same individual, confirming that it has been intentionally retained in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the wristwatch visible on the left wrist of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the costume and accessories of the third individual. The individual's costume is elaborate with long sleeves, and there is no wristwatch visible on the left wrist. In Image A, a wristwatch is visible, indicating that it was removed or hidden in the edited image, possibly due to the long-sleeved costume design.",

      "question": "Is there a ring visible on the ring finger of the left hand of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the third individual's left hand is visible, but the floral costume and gloves cover any original details such as rings. In Image A, a ring is clearly seen on the ring finger of the third individual. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the ring is obscured or not included in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the tattoo visible on the forearm of the third individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the third individual wearing a full-body costume with long sleeves and gloves, which cover the arms entirely. This would obscure any tattoos that were originally visible. In Image A, the tattoo on the forearm of the third individual is distinctly visible. Therefore, in Image B, the tattoo is not visible due to the costume.",

      "question": "Are yellow daffodil flowers visible in the flowerbed behind the group?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a garden with trees and shrubs, and among them are visible yellow daffodil flowers similar to what would be expected in a spring garden setting. This similarity is noticed when comparing it to Image A, where yellow daffodil flowers are also visible in the flowerbed. Therefore, the flowers remain part of the scenery in both images.",

      "question": "Are the five individuals positioned in the same left-to-right order as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals are wearing distinctive costumes but maintain the same arrangement as in Image A. The distinguishing factor in both images is the presence of the leader in the center, flanked by two individuals on each side. Their hands and how they hold signs or cards (in the case of Image A) provide clues to their order. The positioning remains identical in both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background exhibits natural elements such as trees and grass but also visibly includes a stone retaining wall directly behind the individuals. This wall is consistent with the stone structure seen in Image A, confirming it as part of the unchanged background setting.",
