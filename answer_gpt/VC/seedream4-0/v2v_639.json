      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its distinctive brown patches outlined in cream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe is depicted as a LEGO model with the well-known small blocks in characteristic brown and cream colors, illustrating the design of the giraffe. This reflects the giraffe's natural pattern with distinctive brown patches outlined in cream, which is an inherent design choice typically made for LEGO representations of giraffes.",

      "question": "Is the person depicted with extended hands toward the giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure representing the person is designed with one arm extended towards the giraffe, replicating the gesture seen in real-life interactions or poses intended to communicate fondness or familiarity. Understanding the LEGO design style and the typical articulation capacity of LEGO minifigures suggests that the depiction is intentional and mirrors such gestures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the person and giraffe positioned close together, maintaining their original relative distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representations of both the person and giraffe are enclosed in a case together, indicating proximity. This closely parallels their relative positioning in Image A, where the person is in direct interaction with the giraffe, suggesting a deliberate attempt to retain the closeness depicted in the original image, albeit at a smaller scale.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the LEGO giraffe with a notably elongated neck that is a distinctive feature of giraffes. The LEGO model captures this characteristic within the constraints of block design, successfully illustrating the iconic long neck that is a well-recognized attribute of giraffes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO minifigure in Image B is wearing a uniform that is light blue, mirroring the color palette used in Image A. This color choice aligns with common uniform color schemes and effectively maintains consistency from the original depiction, indicating a careful consideration of the character's outfit in transitioning from real-life imagery to LEGO depiction.",
