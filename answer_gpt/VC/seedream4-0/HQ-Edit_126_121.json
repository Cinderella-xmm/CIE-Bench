      "question": "Are the gorilla’s eyes golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's eyes appear to be dark and do not have any golden-yellow hue. The color and light levels in the image suggest that the eyes are natural and without any bright or distinct coloration. Common knowledge indicates that gorillas typically have darker eyes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a prominent silver-colored crest on the top of the gorilla’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays a gorilla with a head that has a uniformly dark fur and does not show any distinctive silver crest. Gorillas often have a mix of dark and silver fur across their heads, however, Image B depicts an absence of any contrasting silver tones.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the banana bunch composed of multiple yellow bananas curving outward from a common stem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a bunch of bananas with several yellow bananas extending outward from a singular stem, which matches the common visual representation of a banana bunch. The visibility of this arrangement is consistent with how bananas grow on a stem.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both of the gorilla’s hands actively holding the banana bunch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's arms seem to suggest that it is holding the banana bunch, but only one hand appears in contact with the bananas securely. This observation from the available visual evidence leads to the conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a gorilla with detailed and textured fur, providing a perception of being thick and dark. This visual depth and texture typically match with the appearance of a gorilla's fur in a realistic portrayal.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is depicted as facing almost directly forward with its eyes pointed towards the viewer, creating a sense of direct engagement or eye contact typical in such illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the bananas have visible brown spots and slight blemishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bananas that feature brown spots and blemishes, depicting them as ripe and realistic, as such markings are common in bananas during certain ripening stages.",
