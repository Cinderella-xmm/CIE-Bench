      "question": "Is the blue herringbone-textured jacket retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited version, the character (an owl with a blurred face) is depicted with a blue feathered outfit rather than a herringbone-textured jacket. The blue color is consistent across both images, but the texture and style have changed from herringbone fabric to feathers, indicating the change in attire.",

      "question": "Are the collar and lapel shape of the blue jacket preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the features of the collar and lapel are not retained. Instead of fabric with distinct collar and lapel elements, the owl is adorned with a feathered arrangement without clear structured lapels or collars.",

      "question": "Are two microphones visible in front of the speaker in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B depict a microphone setup in front of the speaker. For Image B, the presence of two microphones is clear and unaltered from the original setup, showing two microphones in front of the owl figure.",

      "question": "Is the speakerâ€™s right hand raised with an open palm in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right appendage of the owl figure is raised with an open palm-like gesture, similar to the gesture in Image A, where the human has an open right hand. This suggests a retained posture of raising the right hand with an open orientation in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the podium does not display any emblem. This is a change from Image A, where a circular emblem with a blue center, gold border, and star pattern is visible. The absence of this emblem in Image B indicates it has been removed in the editing process.",
