        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the pie has a visible crisscross lattice pattern of pastry strips on its surface, which is a common style for fruit pies.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible dusting of white powdered sugar on the surface of the pie. The pie crust appears plain and lacks the white specks that suggest powdered sugar.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie crust is not uniformly golden brown. The crust appears slightly lighter and more consistently colored than a typical golden brown crust, likely due to the editing of the image.",
