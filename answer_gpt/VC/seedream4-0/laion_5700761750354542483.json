    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the butterfly’s four-winged structure with two large upper wings and two smaller lower wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the butterfly maintains its four-winged structure, which includes two prominently larger upper wings and two smaller lower wings. This is evident from the visual analysis where the wings are clearly distinct and follow a common butterfly pattern.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted with symmetrical wings on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image showcases the butterfly with symmetrical wings. Both sides of the butterfly's wings mirror each other in terms of shape and decorative patterns, suggesting symmetry.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible central body connecting the wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a visible central body connecting the butterfly's wings. This is a common feature in butterfly designs to provide structure and cohesion between the wings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a loop or attachment point at the top of the butterfly’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is a visible attachment point at the top of the butterfly's head in the edited image. This is suggested by the presence of the curved antennae which originate from this region, simulating a common attachment or loop design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned with wings fully spread in a flat, horizontal orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image of the butterfly shows its wings spread out fully in a horizontal fashion. This common butterfly positioning allows for the showcase of wing patterns and decorations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the wings proportionally larger than the body, matching the original scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the proportion where the wings are larger than the body, which is typical of butterfly designs. The ratio appears consistent, preserving the visual balance seen in such representations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the upper wings have a pointed tip and curved outer edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the upper wings have a pointed tip and a gently curved outer edge, typical of many butterfly structures. This design element is visually apparent and aligns with common butterfly depictions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the lower wings visibly smaller and more rounded than the upper wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower wings in the edited image are smaller and more rounded compared to the upper wings, in line with typical butterfly wing structures. This design is visible and clearly differentiates the shape and size of the wings.",
