      "question": "Is the vertical facial split between black and white fur still present, dividing the face precisely down the center?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's face features a vertical split that is primarily between two shades of brown and white rather than black and white. The face is divided down the center, but the colors differ from Image A. Therefore, the altered split does not have black fur, but has brown shades and white instead.",
