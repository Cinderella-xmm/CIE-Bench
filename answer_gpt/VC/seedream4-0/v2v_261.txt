    "Question": "Q1: Is the surfboard depicted with an elongated oval shape and a central stringer running along its length?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see a chibi character inside a snow globe with a surfboard in front of what looks like a sunset scene. The surfboard is depicted as part of a stylized figurine, suggesting it may have a simple and cartoonish design typically associated with chibi art. Such designs do not usually include detailed features like a central stringer. In this miniaturized and stylized portrayal, the surfboard is not an enlarged display as in Image A, where the surfboard has a detailed, elongated oval shape with a visible central stringer.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a small white wax block being held by the right hand and applied to the surface of the surfboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character does not have detailed representations such as holding a wax block, as it is designed in a simplistic style common in chibi figures. The focus is on the cute and stylized representation rather than small detailed interactions with the surfboard, unlike in Image A where there’s a clear action of applying wax.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the right hand positioned so that the fingers are gripping the wax block and making direct contact with the surfboard’s surface?",
    "explanation": "The chibi figure within Image B is styled for simplicity and cuteness rather than realistic actions, and appears not to be engaged in detailed actions such as gripping a wax block. This exact interaction is evident in Image A, where the surfer’s right hand is clearly seen applying wax.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the left hand placed flat on the surfboard, parallel to the board’s surface, providing support?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized representation of the character does not provide enough detail to identify specific hand placements on the surfboard like in Image A. In Image A, the left hand is visibly flat on the board for support during the wax application. Such details are not the focus in the chibi presentation in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the surfboard’s surface show a granular, textured pattern consistent with wax application?",
    "explanation": "Image B, being a chibi-styled depiction within a snow globe, lacks the granular texture detail seen in real-life portrayals. The surfboard depicted does not display a waxed texture, unlike Image A, where you can see the wax application evident in the surface's texturing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the figure positioned in a crouched, forward-leaning posture with knees bent and upper body angled over the surfboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is inside a snow globe in a rather static pose typical of figurines. It does not depict the dynamic, crouched-over, and active posture shown in Image A, where the person is leaning forward and interacting with the surfboard.",
    "answer": "No"
