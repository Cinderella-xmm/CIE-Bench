      "question": "Does the tennis player retain the pose with her right arm holding the racket and her left arm raised in a fist pump?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image (Image B), the tennis player is depicted as a chibi illustration. Her right arm is extended forward holding the tennis racket but the left arm is not raised in a fist pump; instead, it is by her side. Therefore, the pose of a fist pump with the left arm is absent in Image B. In comparison with Image A, the real tennis player indeed has her left arm raised in a fist pump. Considering this discrepancy, the answer regarding Image B is no.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clay court lines are visible with a white outline on the red clay, serving to define boundaries, as commonly done in tennis courts. These lines are retained in the edited image, providing the necessary demarcation of court boundaries, just as in Image A where the real court lines are clearly defined.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the chibi illustration of the tennis player is wearing a red dress and a white visor, which resemble the basic shapes and colors of the real tennis player in Image A, who is wearing an orange dress and a white visor. The dress shows consistency in form regarding the sleeveless top and skirt, and the visor's basic design is preserved.",

      "question": "Is the tennis racket represented as a black-filled shape with minimal detailing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis racket in Image B is depicted as an illustration with outlined strings and seems to have minimal detailing. Instead of pure black, it maintains some semblance of structure but lacks detailed features typical in realistic depictions. This contrasts with Image A, where the racket has visible strings and detailing. Thus, while not entirely black-filled, the edited image suggests simplicity in the detailed representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi illustration does not display a fist pump or any direct tennis-related gestures attributable to a successful play moment. This compares with Image A, where the real tennis player's left arm with a fist pump gesture represents a tennis-related expression common in moments of match success or confidence.",
