      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features bookmarks shaped like famous skyscrapers. The central golden skyscraper in the original image has a curved, tapering silhouette; however, the bookmarks do not display this feature. Instead, they retain straight, rectangular forms typical of classic skyscraper designs like Empire State Building. Therefore, the bookmark does not retain the curved, tapering silhouette of the central golden skyscraper.",

      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has bookmarks representing rather symmetrical skyscraper tops, akin to the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building, with pointed tops typical of recognizable architecture. The leftmost skyscraper in the original image has an asymmetrical, sharp top; however, the bookmarks do not showcase this detail. Therefore, the bookmark does not retain the sharp, asymmetrical top of the leftmost skyscraper.",

      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the stepped, rectangular form of the building next to the central tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image reveals bookmarks of skyscrapers with linear, rectangular, and vertical architecture, including designs similar to the iconic Empire State Building's stepped form. The building next to the central tower in the original image appears to have a stepped, rectangular form. Given the Empire State Building in the bookmarks has a similar form, it can be assumed that the bookmark retains this shape aspect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the vertical light strip pattern on the right-side skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bookmarks feature vertical striped detailing representative of skyscraper architectures like the Chrysler Building. In the original image, the right-side skyscraper features vertical light strips that contribute to its visual characteristics. The bookmarks don't retain specific light strip patterns but instead display symmetrical linear designs associated with classic skyscrapers. Thus, the bookmark does not retain the vertical light strip pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bookmark preserve the height-to-width ratio and tapering proportion of the central skyscraper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central skyscraper in the original image showcases a noticeable tapering proportion, leading to a distinctive height-to-width ratio. The bookmarks in the edited image have more standardized height-to-width ratios typical of famous architectures like Empire State Building, not retaining the unique tapering proportions. Therefore, the bookmarks do not preserve these specific proportions from the central skyscraper.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bookmark retain the wider base of the central skyscraper compared to its upper section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central skyscraper in the original image displays a design where the base is wider compared to its upper section. The bookmarks in the edited image display more uniform and even proportions typically associated with standard bookmarks and conventional skyscraper representation such as Empire State Building. Thus, the bookmarks do not retain the wider base characteristic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the original image, there is a red buoy visible in the water in front of the skyscrapers. The edited image is focused on bookmarks, depicting skyscrapers without any water-related elements, thus omitting the buoy. Therefore, the red buoy is not present in the edited image.",
