      "question": "Is the anvil present with a blocky rectangular base and a pointed horn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is visually depicted with both a blocky rectangular base and a pointed horn. This is a common design for anvils, allowing for a versatile use in blacksmithing. The blocky base provides stability, while the horn is used for shaping metal. This logic applies to identifying standard features of an anvil.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows a red-orange glowing metal object on the anvil in Image B. This coloration and glow suggest that the metal is hot and being worked on, which aligns with the typical blacksmithing process. The luminous appearance indicates that the metal has been heated to a high temperature.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is visibly positioned above the glowing metal on the anvil, as though the blacksmith is either about to strike or has just finished a strike on the hot metal, which is a typical action in the metalworking process to shape it.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The anvil in Image B is shown resting on a circular wooden stump. This is a typical setup in a blacksmith’s workshop to provide a stable, elevated surface for working on metal, utilizing the stump to absorb impact and reduce vibrations.",
