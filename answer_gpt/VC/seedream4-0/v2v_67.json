        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine features a brown coat and a distinct white blaze running down its face. This matches the typical coloring seen on horses and is visually similar to that of Image A, where the horse also has a brown coat and a white blaze.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine stands in a composed position, with a gentle expression that suggests calmness and serenity. Its features do not depict any stress or agitation. Image A shows a horse with no signs of distress, relaxed posture, and calmness in its stance. The comparison shows that both are portrayed in a relaxed manner, bit given that this is a figurine, it lacks expression depicting emotion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a small depiction within a circular frame inside the box, showing a background scene with what appears to be a rustic barn set against a sunset. In Image A, the horse is positioned in front of a barn structure during sunset, indicating a rural setting.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, warm colors are evident in the backdrop of the figures within the box, portraying a sunset with orange and yellow hues.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B exhibits simplified, stylized features with circular black eyes and an abstracted nose, contrasting with the more detailed and realistic depiction of the horse's eyes and nose in Image A. Despite this simplification, the placement and form of these features correlate with the horseâ€™s typical facial structure.",
