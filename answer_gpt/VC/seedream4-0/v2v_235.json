        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted with a simple chibi-style design where the hair appears to be short and dark. Chibi characters typically have minimalistic and stylized features, including simplified hairstyles. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the dancer does have short dark hair.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is wearing a black outfit similar to a sleeveless leotard, which is commonly worn in ballet. The simplicity and color match the typical representation of a leotard used for ballet performances.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's left arm is extended outward, but the hand does not show fingers splayed forward towards the viewer as typical of certain dance gestures. The hand position seems relaxed rather than direct towards the viewer.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
