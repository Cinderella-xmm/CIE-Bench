    "Question": "Q2: Is there visible red spice coating on the shrimp?",
    "explanation": "The comic-style illustration in Image B features shrimp engaging in a 'spicy adventure' narrative. In the last panel, the shrimp are depicted in a pile with some form of seasoning, and given the context of spices, it is reasonable to infer that the depicted small red particles represent seasoning, possibly spice. Therefore, there are red elements suggesting the shrimp are depicted with a red spice or seasoning coating.",

    "Question": "Q5: Do the shrimp maintain a curled, C-shaped form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are illustrated with an anthropomorphic style, standing upright, engaging in activities and showing expressions. While the shrimp characters are presented in a dynamic manner typical of comic illustrations rather than a realistic curled form, the context of being shrimp still implies they represent a version of shrimp, which naturally have a curled form when cooked. However, no shrimp in the comic are in a curled, C-shaped form like cooked shrimp.",
