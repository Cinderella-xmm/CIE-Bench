    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the yellow color and cubed arrangement of the mango?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango appears with a bright yellow color and a cubed arrangement.

    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image retain the green color and sliced appearance of the lime?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lime is depicted as a green object, but it appears animated or stylized compared to a real lime. It has a glossy look and a winking face printed on it, diverging from the realistic depiction of a lime in Image A, where the lime is shown as a natural fruit slice. While the color is retained, the appearance is not sliced as it is in Image A, where the lime is more fresh and realistic.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image retain the orange-red color and granular texture of the chili powder?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chili powder retains its orange-red color and is placed in a bowl.

    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image retain the wooden texture of the plate?",
    "explanation": "Image A shows the plate with a natural wooden texture, typical of wooden serving wares. In contrast, Image B maintains a similar color but does not clearly depict a wooden texture; instead, it seems more like a smooth surface potentially made from a different material. The close inspection of texture differences suggests that Image B lacks the detailed wooden texture characteristic seen in Image A.",
