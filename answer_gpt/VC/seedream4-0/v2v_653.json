        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To analyze Image B, each of the six chibi-style stickers features a character with short brown hair. Moreover, five of the stickers clearly show the character wearing a white lab coat. The sixth sticker in the bottom left seems to feature an explosion or visible props, but it's not clear whether a lab coat is visible or not.",

      "question": "Is the subject wearing a light blue shirt visible beneath the lab coat in all stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only the first two stickers at the top (one holding beakers, the other with a clipboard) feature the subject wearing a white lab coat with a visible light blue shirt beneath it. For the other stickers, the shirt color isn't clearly visible due to the absence of detail above the lab coat.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the chibi-style stickers, the character consistently has short brown hair in all six stickers. This characteristic was checked by observing each sticker's hairstyle, revealing continuity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the chibi-style stickers display the character with a beard. All the stickers have clear lines and depictions where facial hair would be absent. This absence aligns with the general chibi art style, which often simplifies facial features.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining each sticker for scientific props, the first sticker features a beaker, the second a clipboard, the fifth a test tube, and the sixth a microscope. This analysis reveals at least four stickers showcasing some form of scientific prop.",
