      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tall willow trees on both sides of the lake, but the fronds are not green; instead, the artwork depicts these trees using shades reminiscent of traditional watercolor styles. Thus, the description of green fronds does not match.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a serene lake body at the center; however, due to the watercolor style, reflections of trees and the sky are not distinctly depicted. Instead, the focus is on the stylistic interpretation rather than reflections.",
