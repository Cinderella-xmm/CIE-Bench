      "question": "Is the woman’s face clearly visible with the same eye shape, nose, mouth, and short wavy black hair as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face is not clearly visible due to the blurring. This makes features like the eye shape, nose, and mouth indistinguishable. However, the short wavy black hair is visible. When compared to Image A, the hair is consistent, but the facial details are not discernible due to the blur.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the robe maintain the red-on-right and navy-blue-on-left color division across the torso and sleeves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon observing the robe, the color divisions of red on the right and navy-blue on the left across the torso and sleeves are maintained as seen in Image A. This separation and specific color placement is consistent across both images, which indicates that the design has been kept the same.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose and vine floral patterns are visibly present along the seams, front panel, and sleeves of the robe. When compared to Image A, these patterns are consistent in placement and style, confirming the continuity of design in both images.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible high slit on the robe, revealing part of the right leg. This is consistent with Image A, where the slit is also present, exposing a portion of the leg through the robe's opening.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, red paper lanterns are depicted hanging above the scene. While they appear more stylized and less realistic compared to Image A, the placement and idea of glowing warmly are consistent with the atmosphere portrayed in Image A.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
