      "question": "Is the red roof of the house located on the left side of the peninsula still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the house is located is visible and remains unchanged. The house with the red roof is clearly visible on the left side of the peninsula. This observation is consistent with the common understanding of how color and structures can be identified in an image.",

      "question": "Is the long black building situated near the center-right of the peninsula still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black building can still be seen in the same location as in Image A, situated on the center-right of the peninsula. The building retains its black color and shape, thus making it recognizable and confirming its presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) maintains the landscape features of the peninsula, including the golden-brown grasslands which cover it. These grasslands are part of the base landscape that is visible despite the addition of a large creature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patches of ice on the lake surface in the foreground remain visible. The only significant change is the addition of the creature, but the ice itself is within the area not obscured and displays a similar pattern as seen in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the snow streaks running down the mountain slopes. The background landscape appears unaltered concerning the snow streaks, continuing to show the snow distributing naturally along the slopes as seen against the contrast of the mountain.",

      "question": "Is the red-roofed house positioned to the left of the black barn along the peninsula?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the red-roofed house remains positioned to the left of the black barn. This position is consistent across both images and is further confirmed by the spatial relationship observed in the landscape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme of Image B, comprising a blue sky, white snow on the mountains, brown grass covering the landscape, and the red roof of the house, is consistent with Image A. These colors compose a natural and unchanged landscape, adding only the fantastical element without altering the original palette.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape of the peninsula in Image B remains consistent with the winding, snake-like curve seen in Image A. Despite the additional elements in the edited image, the physical geography essentially retains its original layout extending into the lake.",
