    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer depicted with her left leg lifted and bent at the knee, while her right foot remains planted on the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's left leg is clearly lifted and bent at the knee, whereas her right foot is touching the ground. This visual cue, combined with the understanding of typical dance postures where one leg is used for stability while the other one is lifted during dynamic movements, supports the conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the dancer positioned on the right side of the image, facing toward the left side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's body position is oriented towards the left side of the frame, as indicated by her arms and legs pointing leftwards. Her placement on the right side of the image is apparent from her position relative to the rest of the scene elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the skirt of the dancer appear to be flared outward and upward due to motion, suggesting a spinning or leaping movement?",
    "explanation": "The dancer's skirt in Image B is portrayed as flared outward and upwards, which typically indicates movement such as spinning or leaping. This appearance can be reasoned from the skirt's positioning and shape, which are characteristic of dynamic motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the dancer positioned in the foreground, with a group of animals in the midground and trees in the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B places the dancer prominently in the foreground, supported by her larger size and clearer details compared to other elements. The animals are visually positioned in the midground due to their smaller size and slightly blurred details, while the trees are in the background, supporting depth perception in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the light source coming from the right side of the image, illuminating the dancer and casting shadows to the left?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to be coming from the right, as evidenced by the illumination on the dancer's right side and shadows falling to the left. This deduction aligns with the general understanding of light direction and shadow casting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
