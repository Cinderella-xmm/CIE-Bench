      "question": "Is the cactus still spherical in overall shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus retains a round shape similar to a sphere, which is a common shape for certain species of cactus. This spherical shape is identifiable through the uniform circular contours of the cactus body, suggesting retention of its original geometrical form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical ribs of the cactus clearly visible and maintaining their segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cactus in Image B displays prominent vertical ribs that are a characteristic feature of many cacti. These ribs maintain a segmented pattern, although enhanced by decorative elements like glowing symbols and gems, they still preserve the integrity of the structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cactus with a primarily green body, despite added decorative elements that enhance its appearance. The predominant color remains green, indicative of the natural coloration typical for such plants.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cactus positioned vertically and resting on a flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is positioned upright and is resting on a flat surface, characterized by the wooden texture that serves as a base. This orientation is typical for a potted or displayed cactus, whereby stability and presentation are optimized.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a textured, flat surface beneath the cactus container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a textured surface beneath the cactus container that resembles wood with visible grain patterns. This texture implies a natural or rustic setting for the cactus, maintaining a flat foundational base.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cactus placed directly above a supporting structure (such as a pedestal or pot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the cactus sitting atop a supporting structure, which is a pedestal resembling stone or earthen material. This type of structure visually supports and elevates the cactus, aligning with common display methods for enhancing visibility.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the light source coming from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light source in Image B appears to be emanating from the upper left corner, highlighted by the bright sun depiction, which causes the shading and shadows to fall toward the lower right. Such lighting is consistent with natural sunlight behavior, providing clear directionality for shadow placement.",
