      "question": "Is the stapler's primary color blue in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stapler viewed from both front and rear angles. In both views, the primary color of the stapler is blue, which is evident from the consistent blue hue visible on the front-facing and rear-facing sides of the staplers. The uniformity in color suggests that blue is the primary color for the entire object.",

      "question": "Does the metallic hinge appear on the stapler in both the front and rear views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the stapler shows a metallic hinge component where the upper part of the stapler connects to the lower part, which is visible under the top section. However, in the rear view of the stapler, such a metallic hinge is not directly visible since the view focuses on the back end rather than the connecting hinge area. Therefore, the metallic hinge appears prominently in the front view but not in the rear.",

      "question": "Is the stapling slot visible in the front view of the stapler?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B from the front view, the stapling slot, which is typically found at the base of a stapler where staples emerge, can be seen directly under the front section. This is consistent with how staplers operate, as they need a visible slot for the stapling functionality.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a light blue strip visible on the top surface of the stapler in both views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both the front and rear views of Image B, the top surface of the stapler is visible, and it is uniformly blue without any light blue strip. Therefore, the continuous blue tone on the top surface indicates the absence of a distinctly lighter blue strip.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background in both the front and rear views of the stapler is a consistent green color. The backdrop and the platform the stapler is placed on both carry the same green hue, indicating a uniform background.",
