    "Question": "Q1: Is there a visible gular pouch located beneath the lower mandible of the beak?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican illustration shows a distinct area beneath the beak that is colored differently and appears to represent the gular pouch. It is exaggerated in size for cartoonish effect, which serves as a visual cue for the gular pouch on a pelican, commonly known for its pouch characteristic. This clear visual indication leads to the conclusion that the gular pouch is visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the feet clearly webbed with visible claws at the tips of each toe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pelican's feet have simplified toes but lack visible detailing like webbing or claws, typically illustrated in a more detailed fashion in realistic images or models. The illustrative style might omit these details for simplicity and exaggeration, leading to the conclusion that the feet do not have visible webbing or claws.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the feathers on the body composed of layered, striated structures with visible individual feather shafts and overlapping edges?",
    "explanation": "The cartoon style of Image B does not show the traditional layered, striated feather structures. Instead, the feathers are shown in solid colors with outlines, focusing on a more abstract representation without individual feather shafts or overlapping edges. This artistic approach negates the realistic textural detail you would expect in layered, striated feather structures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the bird have a long neck curving down from the head to a broad, rounded body?",
    "explanation": "The cartoon pelican in Image B displays a long neck that curves downwards to a body that is broad and rounded, indicative of a pelican's silhouette. Even though it is a simplified version, the essential shape is maintained to represent the iconic posture of a pelican.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are both legs positioned under the body, supporting the pelican in a grounded standing pose?",
    "explanation": "The cartoon image in B depicts the pelican with both legs visually positioned below the body, suggesting a standing position. Although simplified, the stance appears grounded based on posture typical in pelican depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a single dark, round eye visible on the side of the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon pelican has exaggerated features, including two large, cartoonish eyes, which deviate from the naturalistic single-eye depiction on one side of the head. These eyes are not dark, round, nor singularly visible as they are intentionally stylized for comedic effect.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a small tuft of feathers raised at the crown of the head?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a pelican wearing a small hat, which obscures the top of the head. Therefore, any tuft of feathers normally visible on the head of this depicted style is hidden or replaced by the hat, leading to the conclusion that no feather tuft is clearly represented.",
    "answer": "No"
