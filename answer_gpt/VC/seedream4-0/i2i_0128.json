      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the hands still visibly interacting with and pressing the keys on the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands appear almost identical to those in Image A, showing fingers placed on the keyboard as if they are typing. The neon lighting does not affect the interaction and positioning of the hands, which suggests that they are indeed pressing the keys in the same manner as the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keyboard retain its original physical layout and key structure despite the added neon effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keyboard layout, including the arrangement and shape of the keys, remains unchanged from Image A. The neon effect adds a colorful glow but does not alter the physical characteristics or structure of the keyboard, which are consistent with a typical laptop keyboard design.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the laptop's overall body shape and placement relative to the hands consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are positioned similarly as in Image A, resting on the keyboard in the same spot. The laptop body shape has not been altered; its structure, including the visible corner and screen position, remains consistent with the original.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands retain their general posture and positioning relative to the keyboard as seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the hands in Image B continues to reflect the same interaction with the keyboard as seen in Image A. The positioning relative to the keyboard is consistent, with fingers placed over keys in a way that indicates typing, despite the added neon effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image retain realistic textures for the keyboard and the surface under the hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even with the neon lighting effects in Image B, the underlying textures of the keyboard and surface appear realistic. This is inferred from the way light and shadow play across the keys and around the hands, showcasing a typical smooth plastic texture of laptop keys and surfaces.",
