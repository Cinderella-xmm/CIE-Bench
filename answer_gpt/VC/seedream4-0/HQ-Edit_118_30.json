      "question": "Is the number \"1902\" clearly visible on the front of the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive shows the number '1902' on its front, which is clear and legible. The number is prominently displayed in a way similar to traditional steam engines, where such numbers are typically placed for easy visibility. Therefore, the answer is based on its clear presentation in the image.",

      "question": "Does the locomotive retain a dominant green color on its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the locomotive as primarily multicolored with various puzzle pieces, including blue, yellow, red, and green. Unlike traditional locomotives that might be dominantly one color, in this image, the color scheme is more eclectic and evenly distributed among multiple colors, showing no dominance of green. Therefore, it does not retain a dominant green color.",

      "question": "Is the station building constructed from stone material with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the station building retains the appearance of being made from stone. Although it has been rendered into a puzzle-piece aesthetic, the underlying representation aims to mimic stone construction, with lines and shading suggesting a textured surface consistent with stonework. Thus, despite the artistic interpretation, it maintains a stone-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there moss growing on the roof of the station building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any moss or similar vegetation on the roof of the station building. The roof is stylized in a puzzle-piece format, representing sections of color without any features indicating moss growth as in traditional representations. Therefore, there is no visibility of moss on the roof.",

      "question": "Are there luggage trunks present on the platform near the passengers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of distinct luggage trunks, there are puzzle pieces on the platform. This interpretation of the scene opts for an artistic representation, replacing typical luggage with puzzle imagery, making it differ from traditional elements found at stations, such as trunks or bags. Therefore, no luggage trunks appear near the passengers.",

      "question": "Are wind turbines visible on the hilltop in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wind turbines distinct and clear on the hilltop in the background. They are illustrated in the same position and similarly in style as would be found in modern landscapes, signifying renewable energy installations visible from afar. Therefore, the wind turbines are present and visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved as it extends into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the railway track as largely straight with no visible curves. Even though landscape representations can render perspective dynamically, the track drawn here does not exhibit any signs of curving into the background, emphasizing more linear traits in this rendering.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there wooden benches on the platform where passengers are seated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench present on the platform, where passengers are seated, seems to have adopted the puzzle aesthetic and does not explicitly maintain the appearance of traditional wooden benches. The artistic style portrays seating with a different emphasis than purely wooden furniture seen historically. Therefore, wooden benches as typically understood are absent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Do the figures on the platform wear clothing consistent with early 20th-century fashion (e.g., top hats, long dresses)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays figures with attire that is simplified and stylized. While the clothing mimics traditional forms with hats and dresses, the art style doesn't precisely replicate historical accuracy, instead opting for simplicity. Nonetheless, the representation leans towards elements seen in early 20th-century fashion.",
