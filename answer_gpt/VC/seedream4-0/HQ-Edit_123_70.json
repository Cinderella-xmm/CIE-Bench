      "question": "Is the bear's body shaped with a distinct hump over the shoulders and a broad, muscular back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear's body structure can be analyzed using visual cues combined with knowledge about bear anatomy. Typically, a bear, especially a grizzly bear, has a distinctive hump over its shoulders which results from strong muscle mass used for digging and strength. Image B features a depiction of a bear possibly in a conceptual or animated form, and such characteristics might be visually represented. Based on typical artistic portrayals of bears, this trait might be exaggerated or stylized.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the salmon have a clearly defined forked tail fin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of the salmon should be assessed based on visual information. The tail fin of a salmon is typically forked, meaning it should have a distinct V-shape. In animated or educational settings, such characteristics might be clearly drawn to aid in identification.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bear’s fur rendered with visible texture and layered shading, showing wetness and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an animated or stylized version of a bear in a classroom setting. While the image is not realistic, the rendering of the bear may still feature texture and shading to simulate fur. Details like wet fur might not be present in such settings since the bear is not in a natural, wet environment like a river.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the salmon colored with a blue-green back and a silvery-white belly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the salmon’s coloring should be analyzed as it is a common feature to aid viewers in identifying the species. Salmon typically have a distinctive coloration; a blue-green back and silvery-white belly are common traits of certain species. Such colors might be depicted especially in educational or stylized images to emphasize these natural traits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible water splashes or ripples around the bear’s lower legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is within a classroom context, and such environmental details like water splashes appear irrelevant due to the unnatural habitat. Therefore, these details are unlikely to be depicted in a controlled setting away from rivers or streams.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bear have a long, broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing the bear in Image B, which is possibly stylistic or anthropomorphic, the typical characteristics of a bear's face, such as a broad snout with visible nostrils and a rounded muzzle, may or may not be accurately represented depending on the artistic style. However, such features are often retained for recognition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the salmon positioned horizontally in the bear’s mouth, with its head protruding forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, which depicts an illustration or stylized scene of the bear with a salmon, if the emphasis is imaginary or stylized, the fish’s position might be more artistic. The typical scene of a bear catching salmon might be illustrated with the salmon horizontal in the mouth, as this is a common and recognizable portrayal.",
