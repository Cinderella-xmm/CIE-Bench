    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's face, including the almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and closed mouth with red lips, preserved in the same position and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the face is blurred, and specific features like almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and mouth cannot be seen or analyzed. Therefore, it cannot be said that these features are preserved in the same position and form.",

      "question": "Are the subject’s hair color (reddish-brown) and tightly curled, rounded hairstyle preserved exactly as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair color is reddish-brown with a tightly curled, rounded hairstyle, which is similar to the description of the original image (Image A) that features similar hair characteristics. Without directly referring to Image A, based on Image B alone, the hair seems preserved.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) does not show any visible jeweled headpiece with a single dangling pendant at the center of the forehead. Therefore, it can be concluded that it is not preserved in the same location and form.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned on a decorative object (such as a hilt) and the left hand resting on the lap, maintaining the same relative placement and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand appears to be holding a decorative object, similar to a hilt, and the left hand is resting downward. These positions are consistent with plausible historical depictions, suggesting the relative placement and orientation are maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) maintains a pale skin tone, but due to the blurred face, it's impossible to discern subtle details like a rosy blush on the cheeks. Without direct visual cues, the preservation of the exact skin tone cannot be confirmed.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the subject appears to have a direct forward-facing position with an upright posture, similar to historical portraits. This suggests that the posture is preserved without deviation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
