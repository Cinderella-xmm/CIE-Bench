    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the orange circular lifebuoy still present and clearly visible in the same position near the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of showing the original context, a cartoonish dolphin-shaped sculpture is present. The sculpture creatively integrates the orange circular lifebuoy as part of its design, resembling an eye. Combining this observation with the knowledge of design and sculpting, it indicates the lifebuoy is no longer present in its original functional position near the netting but has been edited into an artistic element of the sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark mesh netting still visible along the shoreline, connected by vertical poles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sand sculpture of a dolphin and the ocean, but it does not display any mesh netting at the shoreline. This suggests that the netting and poles have been removed or edited out for artistic purposes, unlike the original context in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline maintain its original diagonal slope from the bottom left to the top right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B maintains the visual perception of the shoreline's slope from the bottom left to the top right due to the positioning of the sand sculpture and the ocean backdrop. This configuration supports the original layout observed in Image A, combining spatial orientation knowledge.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy physically connected to one of the vertical poles of the netting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifebuoy is integrated into the sculpture's design, appearing as an eye rather than being connected to any pole in netting. Hence, based on practical knowledge of sculptural design modifications, it indicates a change from its original physical connection seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible white foam patterns in the water immediately adjacent to the shoreline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water in Image B is depicted with visible white foam patterns near the shore, similarly to Image A. The presence of white foam suggests active waves and splashes at the shoreline, owing to general understanding of oceanic behaviors in both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sand along the shoreline still light beige in color, without significant discoloration or tinting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sand in Image B, forming part of the sculpture, remains light beige in color, supporting its continuity from Image A. This color attribute is consistent with most natural beach sands, as no unusual coloring or tinting is evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are at least three vertical poles visible along the netting, evenly spaced from the foreground to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vertical poles have been substituted by the presence of a sand sculpture, and thus, the poles alongside netting seen in Image A are absent. No evenly spaced vertical poles along the shoreline can be observed in the edited image.",
