    "Question": "Q1: Is the text 'STORY PAGES' present in uppercase serif font above the book?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature the text 'STORY PAGES' in any visible form. Instead, it has a snow globe with an open book inside, and there are no text elements above the book, differentiating it from a design that might include typography. Using world knowledge about book representations, the focus is on the book within the globe, which excludes the presence of stated text.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the book have a visible spine and two cover edges forming an open structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book inside the snow globe shows a depiction of an open book structure with visible pages and without a distinct spine or cover edges as would be expected in real books. The illustration of the book emphasizes pages more than distinct elements like spines or edges due to artistic choices.",
