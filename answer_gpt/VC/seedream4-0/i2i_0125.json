      "question": "Do the apples retain their vibrant red color with white speckles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apples display a rich red hue with numerous small white specks scattered across their surfaces. This combination of colors and speckles gives the apples a lifelike and fresh appearance, commonly associated with the natural look of apples. The added text labels 'Sweet' and 'Fresh' do not alter the color or speckles of the apples.",

      "question": "Are the apples shown with a smooth, shiny texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Through the visual cues in Image B, the apples exhibit a noticeable smooth surface with highlights that suggest a shiny texture. This glossy sheen is typically seen in well-polished apples, aiming to convey freshness. The texture observed in Image B aligns with how fresh apples usually appear in reality and is not altered by the added text labels.",

      "question": "Is natural light visible, creating realistic reflections on the apple surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear indications of natural light coming through, as evidenced by the reflections and subtle highlights on the apples' surfaces. The light appears to come from a window, creating soft highlights that enhance the apples' three-dimensional look, indicative of a real-world setting. This lighting effect remains realistic despite the added text.",

      "question": "Does the image retain the rustic wooden texture of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table in Image B features a visible rustic wooden texture, characterized by visible grains and natural imperfections typical of wood surfaces. This suggests a natural and cozy setting, enhancing the presentation of the apples. The addition of the words 'Sweet' and 'Fresh' does not alter the texture of the table.",

      "question": "Is the background softly blurred with hints of natural greenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is out of focus with the presence of green shapes that resemble foliage, suggesting a natural setting beyond the apples. The soft blur technique helps keep the focus on the apples while still implying an environment rich with greenery. This effect is unchanged by the text additions in the image.",
