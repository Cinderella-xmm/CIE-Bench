    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the horse depicted with a dark mane running along its neck and a long, dark tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse features a lighter-colored mane that runs along its neck and matches the horse's tail, which are both a lighter shade rather than dark. Based on the visual cues, the mane and tail do not appear dark, so the description does not match.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the elephant have two visible, curved white tusks extending from its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant exhibits two tusks that are very similar in tone to the rest of the body, instead of being distinctly white. The tusks do extend from the mouth, but they blend with the elephant's overall color scheme.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a flat wooden platform positioned between the horse and the elephant, supporting the horse and resting on the elephant’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly illustrates a wooden platform placed between the horse and the elephant, supporting the former and resting on the latter's back. It is visually distinct and aligns with world knowledge of what a wooden platform looks like.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the horse and the elephant depicted in profile view, facing toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the horse and the elephant are clearly depicted in profile view, each facing toward the left side of the scene. This is evident from their posture and positioning within the frame.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant have a long, segmented trunk that curls upward at the tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an elephant with a trunk that has a very subtle curvature, almost straight through most of its length, and only slightly upward curling at the tip, not dramatically so. It fits the criteria of being long and slightly segmented.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color with a subtle paper-like texture and no additional scenery or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B appears to be a uniform beige color and lacks additional scenery or other objects. It provides a neutral backdrop against which the sculptures are presented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the horse’s body primarily a rich brown color with black lower legs, mane, and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's body is indeed a rich brown color, but its mane and tail are lighter, similar to the body color, and the legs do not appear strictly black. Thus, the description does not match.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
