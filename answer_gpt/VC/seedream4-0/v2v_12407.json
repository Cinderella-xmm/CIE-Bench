      "question": "Is the mango depicted with an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is depicted with rounded and elongated edges, suggesting an oval shape. The visual cues show that it is broader in the middle and tapers at the ends, which is characteristic of an oval shape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small stem visible at the top of the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pixelated illustration shows a small dark area at the top of the mango, which resembles a stem. This darker dot contrasts against the bright yellow of the mango's surface, allowing the conclusion that it is a stem.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper towel folded into a cradle-like shape beneath the mango?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a structure beneath the mango that supports it. This structure has curves and folds that resemble a cradle, providing a space where the mango is securely positioned.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four clearly defined flaps extending from the paper towel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pixel-art style makes it apparent that four distinct flaps protrude from beneath the mango. The clear separation and definition in the pixel blocks indicate these are four individual extensions of the paper towel.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mango positioned in the center of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is situated such that it creates a shadow and is placed towards the middle of the frame but actually on a part of the table bisected by shadow. The orientation and perspective suggest that it's not the center but slightly off to the side.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the table show a horizontal wood grain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts pixelated lines that move horizontally across the surface of the table. This consistent pattern reflects what is commonly seen in wood grain design, running parallel to the horizon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is a wooden chair partially visible behind the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a pixelated structure with characteristics of a chair back visible behind the table and towards the right. It's depicted using vertical and horizontal lines typical of a wooden chair design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a diagonal shadow cast by the mango onto the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shadow cast on the table that projects diagonally from the mango's base. The presence of this darker pixelated area indicates a diagonal shade direction attributed to the light source.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
