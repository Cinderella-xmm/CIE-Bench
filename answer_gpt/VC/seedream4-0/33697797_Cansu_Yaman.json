      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor is visible and displays a gray stone-paved appearance. The edited image maintains the characteristic color and texture of stone paving, which is commonly observed in garden or greenhouse settings.",

      "question": "Are the metal support beams and window grid patterns visible in the greenhouse structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains elements of industrial architecture, such as metal support beams and window grid patterns. These features are indicative of greenhouse structures that use glass panels for natural light penetration. Observing Image B validates that these structural elements are clearly present in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelving units are replaced or altered with floating moss-covered platforms featuring fantastical creatures and glowing elements. The original wheels that facilitated mobility are not visible or relevant in this magical transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, the plants appear to grow naturally from moss-covered platforms or directly from the ground. There are no black plastic pots supporting these plants, emphasizing a shift to a more organic, fantasy-driven environment compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a plant with broad green leaves positioned in the foreground on the right side, similar to the composition in Image A. This strategic placement serves as a visual anchor within the edited magical scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clear central aisle present in Image A is obscured by the presence of floating plants and creatures. The shelving units from Image A are transformed, altering the spatial dynamics. As the edited image prioritizes fantastical elements, it lacks a defined aisle between traditional shelving units.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the glass roof structure remains, the light brown woven shade canopy is absent. Instead, vibrant, translucent foliage hangs from the ceiling, consistent with the magical transformation theme. The removal of the shade canopy aligns with the fantastical setting intended in the edited image.",
