    "Question": "Q1: Is the capybara’s snout broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, consistent with its real-world anatomy?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's snout is observed to be broad and flat with a rounded muzzle, which is consistent with the anatomy of a real-world capybara. By combining this observation with the knowledge of capybara physical traits, we can confirm that Image B depicts these features correctly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the capybara’s ears small, rounded, and located high on the head?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the capybara with small, rounded ears that are positioned high on its head—quite typical of real capybaras. These anatomical features match real-world observations of capybaras' ear characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the capybara standing upright and facing directly toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is depicted in an upright posture, directly facing the viewer, apparent by its forward-facing torso and head position which aligns with the viewer's line of sight.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are both hands positioned in front of the chest, gripping an object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's hands are both positioned in front of its chest, each holding an object—this is visually evident in how the paws are clasped around a cup.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the capybara’s fur primarily light brown with darker tones around the muzzle?",
    "explanation": "The fur of the capybara in Image B appears primarily light brown, with slightly darker shades around the muzzle area. This fur pattern is consistent with the general appearance of capybaras in the natural world.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the capybara have a stocky, large body with short legs and a thick torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara displays characteristics of being stocky and large, with a thick torso. However, the depiction in the image concentrates more on the upper body without detailed visual evidence of its legs, typically short in real capybaras, which makes it unclear, focusing mostly on the torso.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the capybara have four limbs visible or implied by posture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, only the front limbs are visible due to the posture, with no visual or implied suggestion of the presence of the hind limbs, given the pose and framing. Therefore, it does not suggest four visible limbs.",
    "answer": "No"
