      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle include a shade of pink that matches the \"Rose Pink\" eyeshadow in the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is shown with a pink background, which can be compared to a 'Rose Pink' shade commonly associated with mid-tone pinks slightly muted by undertones. Using this world knowledge, the shade in the background of Image B can indeed match what would be typical for a 'Rose Pink' eyeshadow, as it is within that general range of pink hues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Anastasia Beverly Hills\" visible on the perfume bottle or its packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible text on the perfume bottle reads 'vala,' with no mention or sight of 'Anastasia Beverly Hills.' The absence of this text indicates that it is not visible on the perfume bottle or its packaging.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the perfume bottle feature an external accent in the color \"Burnt Orange\" as seen in the palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no 'Burnt Orange' color visible on the perfume bottle. Instead, the bottle features a golden rose accent, which is a different shade entirely. Knowing 'Burnt Orange' is a specific shade of orange, we can conclude from observing the image that no such accent is present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dual-ended makeup brush visible in the final perfume bottle design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows only a perfume bottle against a pink background. There is no sign of a makeup brush or any similar object included in the design or placed nearby. The object solely focuses on the perfume bottle, eliminating the presence of a dual-ended makeup brush.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of the image a soft pink gradient matching the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a background which carries a soft pink gradient. Based on common knowledge of gradients and their use in product photography to create soothing and enhancing backdrops, this matches the description of a 'soft pink gradient.' Such a gradient is likely consistent with the visual intent seen in Image A.",
