      "question": "Is the train labeled \"BB 3017\" still visible and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe a train with the label 'BB 3017' visible on the front of the locomotive. This label is clearly legible, indicating that the editing did not alter or obscure this part of the train. The clear legibility is determined by the contrast and clarity of the text against the white background of the train's front.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the railway tracks, including the parallel tracks beside the main line, still intact and correctly laid out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows railway tracks with the train positioned on one of them, and there are additional tracks visible beside it. These tracks appear to be intact and correctly laid out in their respective positions. The tracks maintain a straight, continuous form, demonstrating no signs of disruption or distortion in the editing process.",

      "question": "Is the train still positioned centrally on the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is seen centrally placed along the railway tracks. The symmetry between the train and the tracks on either side supports this observation. The center position can be inferred from the alignment of the train with the tracks and the balanced space on each side of the train.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the train, including the white locomotive prominently visible in the foreground and the freight car behind it, appears intact. The train parts are coherent and maintain their original form, indicating that the editing has not altered their structural integrity.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railroad signal marked with the number '3' is visible on the left side of the image. The details of the signal, including its position and the numbers, are clearly depicted, showing that it is still present and unaltered in the scene.",
