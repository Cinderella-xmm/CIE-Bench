        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the player is depicted as a chibi character passing through a futuristic portal. The design of the chibi character does not display the same level of detail as a realistic depiction. In many cartoon or chibi animations, such specific details like jersey numbers are often not included or prioritized in the visual representation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Similar to my analysis in Q1, in the edited image, the chibi character representation lacks specific details like numbers on the jersey, which are often omitted in favor of a simplified art style common in chibi designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the player, depicted as a chibi character, is wearing a purple outfit and cap. However, due to the simplified style of chibi art, specific details like the brim color may not be accurately represented.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this image, showcasing a chibi art style, there are no batting gloves depicted on the character's hands. Chibi representations often feature exaggerated and simplified features, which may omit details like gloves.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the focus is more on the transition through a portal, and the scene does not depict the character holding a bat. Chibi character representations might not always include accessories or pose details found in realistic images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this image, there is a baseball visible next to the chibi character, indicative of its presence, but it's not shown in motion toward the bat due to the whimsical nature of the scene. The emphasis is on the interaction with the portal instead.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image focuses more on the chibi player moving through the portal without holding a bat, thus removing the context of a bat being gripped by both hands.",
