      "question": "Is the toilet still predominantly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet is clearly visible as predominantly white. The visual perspective shows a clean, bright structure that is characteristically contrasted against the gray tiles, which supports the notion of a white color. Combining the visual information with the common understanding that toilets are often white, it is reasonable to conclude the color remains unchanged.",

      "question": "Is the toilet lid still open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet lid is visibly lifted, as evidenced by the perspective showing the inner rim of the toilet seat. This is consistent with an open toilet seat. Visual indicators such as the lack of shadowing or overlay that would suggest a closed lid further confirm this assessment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flush tank still attached to the wall above the toilet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flush tank is clearly mounted on the wall directly above and connected to the toilet bowl. The visual positioning relative to the wall and the toilet's plumbing is typical of standard toilet designs, indicating the tank remains attached to the wall as expected.",

      "question": "Are the walls and floor still covered with gray square tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the walls and floor with a consistent pattern of square tiles that are gray in color. Each tile's squared shape and the lines that form the grout are typical indicators of tiling. These tiles are similar to those commonly used in bathrooms for their water-resistant properties, maintaining the same appearance as what would have been in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toilet is positioned such that two walls are visible meeting at a right angle directly behind it, indicating a corner placement. The alignment with the room's corner is a known efficient use of space in bathroom designs, suggesting the position has not changed.",
