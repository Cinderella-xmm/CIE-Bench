      "question": "Is the small structure with a blue roof still present at the highest point of the ridge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a dragon dominates the scene, yet upon closer inspection, the small structure with the blue roof present at the highest point of the ridge in Image A appears to be missing in Image B. The ridge in Image B is largely obscured by the large, fantastical creature that is in sharp contrast to any real-world elements like buildings, which supports this conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hikers still visible along the central trail, maintaining their original positions relative to the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, hikers are visible along the central trail, signifying human activity along the path. However, Image B introduces a dragon that occupies much of the focus, and no hikers are visible. The central trail itself is discernible, but any previous human presence has been altered or obscured by the addition of the dragon.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ridge maintain its original undulating shape, forming a continuous elevated backbone from foreground to background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape of the ridge remains discernible in Image B, maintaining a similar undulating form as in Image A. Despite the addition of the dragon, the underlying terrain appears unaltered in its structure, showing continuity in elevation from foreground to background.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees and shrubs on the slopes of the ridge still present in their original locations and densities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of trees and shrubs on the slopes of the ridge in Image B seems largely consistent with Image A. While the dragon occupies significant foreground space, the surrounding environment, particularly the flora, appears unchanged in terms of location and density.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky still uniformly overcast with soft, diffused lighting, matching the original tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the sky exhibits a soft, diffused light typical of an overcast day. Image B retains the overcast sky without significant alteration to its tone or light quality as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the grassy areas on both sides of the path still green and undisturbed, retaining their original texture and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassy areas on both sides of the path in Image B appear as lush and green as they did in Image A. Despite the fantastic element of the dragon, the grass retains its original color and texture, undisturbed by additional elements in the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the distant hills still visible in the background, fading into mist as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant hills maintain their presence, with the characteristic fading into mist that was observable in Image A. The addition of the dragon does not obscure or alter the distant background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocky outcrops at the edge of the path are discernible in Image A. However, in Image B, these features are largely obscured by the presence of the dragon, making it difficult to discern their original positions.",
