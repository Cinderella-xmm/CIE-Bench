    "Question": "Q1: Are the cheetahs in a seated position with bent hind legs, tucked tails, and upright front paws?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are depicted in a seated position. Their hind legs are bent, and their front paws are touching the base, which indicates an upright position. The tails are curved slightly towards the base. This configuration is typical for a seated posture in statues for stability and aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the head of each cheetah turned slightly to the side, away from the central divider?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the heads of the cheetahs are oriented slightly towards the side rather than directly forward. This is evident by the way their snouts are turned lateral to the central divider, which is a common artistic choice to give the figure a dynamic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does each cheetah rest on a two-tiered base with a black upper section and a bronze-colored stepped lower section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each cheetah rests on a well-defined two-tiered base. The upper section is black, and it tapers down to a bronze-colored lower section. This stepped design can be visually confirmed by observing the distinct color difference and shape between the two sections of the base.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the cheetah figures positioned symmetrically, one on the left and one on the right, equidistant from the center?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows each cheetah positioned symmetrically on either side of a central panel. This symmetrical arrangement is highlighted by the mirrored posture and placement of the figures relative to the central divider, which ensures visual balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there exactly three vertical panels positioned between the cheetahs, with two narrower ones flanking a wider central one?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, between the cheetahs, there are indeed three vertical panels visible. The two outer panels are narrower than the central one, aligning with the question description. This can be visually discerned by noting the distinct widths of these glass-like panels.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the tail of each cheetah curve upward and rest on the base behind the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tails do not appear to curve upward significantly. They seem to rest mostly flat on the base behind the body, suggesting a downward rather than upward curve.",
    "answer": "No"
