      "question": "Is the clock face present on the upper section of the left bell tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left bell tower appears simplified and does not have details like a clock face present. The tower is more stylized, resembling a model or sculpture. By common knowledge, if an object looks sculpted or simplified with fewer intricate details, such elements like a clock are often omitted.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right bell tower also seems to be represented as a part of a crafted or sculpted scenario. It contains less detail compared to realistic depictions.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears as a stylized sculpted depiction of the cathedral. The central area above the entrance shows a circular design which is reminiscent of a rose window with intricate patterns, commonly seen in cathedral designs. Given its prominence in the artwork, this is likely intended to symbolize stained glass.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a stylized version of the cathedral façade, showing a large central door with two additional openings that suggest door placements on either side, echoing traditional architectural symmetry and function in such structures even though the details are simplified.",
