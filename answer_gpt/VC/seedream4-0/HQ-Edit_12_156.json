      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the structure retain four distinct legs forming a wide base that converge upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is not depicted as having four distinct legs. Instead, it has a singular, vine-covered structure that doesn't clearly show a break between separate legs moving upward. This gives it an organic, intertwined look rather than a structured, four-legged base typical of the Eiffel Tower in Image A, which features a typical Eiffel Tower structure with a wide base converging upward to a point.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tower’s shape vertically tapered, narrowing progressively from base to spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower has a generally tapered shape, which narrows from the base to the spire at the top. This tapering is enhanced by the twisting vines and floral elements, which give it a more organic look. The presence of a crystal structure at the top emphasizes this tapering effect. Compared to Image A, where the Eiffel Tower is clearly visible with its iconic tapering silhouette, the concept of narrowing as it rises is maintained, though the visual interpretation is creatively altered.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal levels or platforms visible along the tower’s height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower does not explicitly exhibit the traditional three horizontal platforms as seen in the Eiffel Tower structure from Image A. The entire design is integrated with vines and flowers without clear, distinguishable platforms that break the vertical ascent of the structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tower centrally positioned in the image, aligned with the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the tower centrally positioned within the frame, maintaining a symmetrical composition. This central alignment draws attention to the tower as the focal point of the image, mirroring the positioning in Image A where the Eiffel Tower is also centrally aligned.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight, symmetrical pathway extending from the foreground directly toward the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no clear straight and symmetrical pathway leading directly to the base of the tower. The foreground area is decorated with an intricate circular design on the ground, which does not extend directly toward the base in a pathway form. In contrast, Image A features a well-defined straight pathway.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the light source (sun or equivalent) located directly behind the base of the tower, creating a halo effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light source is not visibly located directly behind the base of the tower creating a halo effect. Instead, the lighting appears to emanate from both the glowing floral decorations on the tower and the ambient light in the sky, giving the scene a mystical glow, unlike Image A, where the sun visibly sets behind the base of the tower creating a distinct halo effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible cityscape in the background, extending horizontally behind the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cityscape in the background, with multiple buildings visible on the horizon line, suggesting a city backdrop that spans horizontally behind the tower. The skyline includes identifiable structures akin to a modern cityscape, comparable to Image A, where the cityscape is a clear feature extending across the horizon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tower significantly taller than all other structures in the image, dominating the vertical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower stands impressively taller than any other visible structures, dominating the vertical space. The addition of a crystal spire further accentuates its height compared to other elements in the composition. Similarly, Image A portrays the Eiffel Tower as the pre-eminent tall structure within the scene.",
