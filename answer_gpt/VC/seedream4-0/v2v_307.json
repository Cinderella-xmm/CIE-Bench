      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage is clearly visible as a rounded rectangular patch lying on the surface, maintaining the same shape as a traditional plaster. By focusing on the form and edges, it is evident that despite the presence of the doll, the bandage itself retains its shape consistent with typical designs seen in daily life. Therefore, according to the visual cues and understanding of standard bandage shapes, the bandage retains its rounded rectangular shape.",

      "question": "Is the central adhesive strip still present in the same relative position and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the central adhesive strip is positioned centrally on the bandage and appears to be consistent in size relative to the bandage itself. This conclusion is drawn from the analysis of the bandage's design where the adhesive strip is typically situated in the center to cover a wound effectively, which matches common adhesive bandage layouts. Comparing with Image A shows no notable deviation in placement or size of the strip.",

      "question": "Does the bandage retain its visible fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the bandage with a discernible fabric texture typically found in cloth bandages. The visible woven pattern provides a clear indication that the bandage maintains a textile-like surface, consistent with Image A where the texture is already established as fabric. Using general knowledge about bandages, the rough texture serves practical purposes like adhesion and comfort, indicating that the fabric texture is indeed present.",

      "question": "Are the bandage's overall proportions consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the proportions of the bandage appear unchanged—elongated with parallel sides and rounded ends—matching conventional designs in terms of aspect ratio. To ensure precision, a use of perceptual cues on length and width relative to its components confirms its proportionality resembles Image A. Such bandages are standardized to cover specific wound sizes, which further supports consistent proportions between the images.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a shadow cast by the bandage, contributing to its three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows are cast by various components, including the bandage, as evident from shadow gradients transitioning on the surface where it rests. This spatial depth indicates interaction with light source and also creates the perception of three-dimensionality, enhancing the realism of the bandage. By comparing with Image A where similar shadow effects are observed, this further confirms the presence of a shadow contributing to its three-dimensional appearance.",
