      "question": "Do the nesting dolls maintain a triangular shape inspired by the pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are shaped like traditional matryoshka dolls which are rounded and cylindrical. This is a stark contrast to the triangular and angular shape of the pyramid in Image A. The key identifying feature here is the classic rounded shape of the matryoshka dolls, which is different from the sharp triangular geometry of a pyramid.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the stone texture seen in the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls have a smooth, polished surface typical of painted wooden items, which contrasts with the rough, stone texture of the pyramid in Image A. The use of paint and varnish on the dolls creates a visibly smooth finish, unlike the rough texture of the stone blocks used in pyramid construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls designed with a symmetrical structure similar to the original pyramid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show objects that are symmetrical along a central vertical axis. The pyramid in Image A has a highly geometric symmetry. In contrast, the nesting dolls in Image B also maintain symmetry regarding their design and painted patterns across each doll. Hence, both share a trait of symmetry despite their different shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending size order on the wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are arranged from left to right in descending size order, which is typical for such displays. This is evident by observing the progressive decrease in the size of the dolls going from left to right.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the largest nesting doll and possibly others incorporate a design element resembling the pyramid's central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the dolls are decorated with pyramid designs, they lack specific elements such as a central entrance which is a prominent feature in the pyramid in Image A. The designs on the dolls focus on the overall triangular pyramid silhouette without detailing specific architectural features like entrances.",
