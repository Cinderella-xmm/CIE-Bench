      "question": "Does the robot still have two distinct upward-pointing antennae on its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is encased in a transparent spherical container, allowing a view of its full body. Despite the enclosure, its head design remains visible. Notably, the robot continues to feature two upward-pointing antennae on its head, similar to the design elements observed in many robots or mechanical constructs, which often include antennas for communication or sensory purposes. These antennae are distinguished as being upward-pointing, confirming their presence.",

      "question": "Is there a blue-tinted visor visible on the robot’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B can be seen clearly through the transparent sphere that houses it. Observing the facial area, we identify a blue-tinted visor that is integral to the robot’s design, positioned where a human-like face or eyes would be. The color and placement suggest a luminous or reflective nature typical of visors on robotic figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there red glowing elements present on the robot’s chest and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a careful examination of the robot’s chest and facial areas through the spherical enclosure reveals elements that are designed with a glow. These features are red, and their illumination serves as a distinct design choice often used to denote power sources or eyes on mechanical entities. The red glow remains visible, emphasizing these elements as purposeful parts of the robot's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segmented armor plates with visible panel lines and rivets still present on the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the robot encased in its transparent housing. Its structural design includes visible segments of armor plates. These plates continue to exhibit detailed panel lines and rivets, indicative of mechanical assembly, which is a common characteristic in robotic designs to suggest complexity, durability, and functionality.",

      "question": "Is the distant city skyline with tall towers and construction cranes visible in the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the robot within a detailed miniature landscape. While other elements like trees and rocks are discernible, the distant skyline, which might include construction cranes and tall towers as seen in urban landscapes, is absent from the composition. Instead, the focus remains on natural and mechanical objects immediately surrounding the robot.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small green trees present in the foreground and midground of the miniature landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature landscape in Image B is carefully crafted around the robot and the transparent sphere encasing it. Notable within this setting are small green trees, distributed in both the foreground and midground. Their presence contributes to the realism and depth of the landscape while providing color contrast against the mechanical elements.",

      "question": "Is there a visible dust cloud beneath the robot’s right foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is positioned on a pedestal within the transparent sphere, which eliminates any interaction with the surrounding ground which would typically produce a dust cloud. Consequently, the observable setting does not include a dust cloud beneath the robot’s right foot, indicating that the environment is static and contained within the sphere.",
