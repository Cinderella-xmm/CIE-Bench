      "question": "Are the shrimp rendered in a pink-orange color consistent with cooked shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp characters are illustrated in a comic style with a vibrant cartoonish pink-orange color, which is typically associated with cooked shrimp. The shrimp's color reflects that of shrimp that have been cooked, as raw shrimp tend to have a grayish, translucent color, while cooked shrimp have a distinct pink and orange hue. Therefore, the shrimp in the comic have the coloration consistent with cooked shrimp.",

      "question": "Is there visible red spice coating on the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comic-style illustration in Image B features shrimp engaging in a 'spicy adventure' narrative. In the last panel, the shrimp are depicted in a pile with some form of seasoning, and given the context of spices, it is reasonable to infer that the depicted small red particles represent seasoning, possibly spice. Therefore, there are red elements suggesting the shrimp are depicted with a red spice or seasoning coating.",

      "question": "Are there yellow lemon wedges with visible rind and pulp in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second panel of Image B shows a shrimp holding a lemon wedge over a plate of shrimp. The lemon wedge is depicted in a cartoon style, with clearly visible yellow rind and a representation of pulp. This visual cue combined with background knowledge that lemon wedges generally look like this in illustrations supports the conclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third panel shows the shrimp character surrounded by green herbs, consistent with finely chopped parsley or similar herbs, floating around. These green elements are clearly connected to the culinary theme of the comic and are depicted as freshly chopped herbs typically used in food preparation.",

      "question": "Do the shrimp maintain a curled, C-shaped form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are illustrated with an anthropomorphic style, standing upright, engaging in activities and showing expressions. While the shrimp characters are presented in a dynamic manner typical of comic illustrations rather than a realistic curled form, the context of being shrimp still implies they represent a version of shrimp, which naturally have a curled form when cooked. However, no shrimp in the comic are in a curled, C-shaped form like cooked shrimp.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon comic strip, which does not feature a realistic depiction of cooking equipment such as a stainless steel pan. The focus is on the shrimp characters, spice adventure, and narrative rather than realistic representations of cookware. Throughout the panels, no stainless steel pan is evident.",
