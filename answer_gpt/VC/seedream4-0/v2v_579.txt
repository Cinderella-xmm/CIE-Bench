    "Question": "Q1: Is the central character (derived from the green block) positioned exactly in the middle of the composition, surrounded by other characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central character, which appears to be derived from the green block, is placed at the center of the composition, surrounded by heart-shaped, animated characters. This arrangement gives a balanced look to the composition, indicating that the central character is indeed positioned centrally, surrounded by others.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain the circular stud pattern on their upper surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animated characters do not display circular stud patterns on their surfaces, unlike the building blocks in Image A. Instead, they have smooth, rounded shapes (specifically the heart shapes) and smooth heads without any visible studs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the characters derived from the blocks primarily composed of rectangular or boxy shapes, preserving the original block geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters have a more animated and rounded design, differing from the blocky, rectangular shapes of building bricks seen in Image A. The characters are depicted with smooth curves and are not maintaining the distinct rectangular block geometry of the original blocks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the composition filled with a dense cluster of characters (originally blocks), arranged in a piled, overlapping manner?",
    "explanation": "Image B has characters arranged with some spacing and not in a piled or overlapping configuration. They are cute animated characters with some space around them, unlike Image A, where blocks were tightly packed and overlapping. Thus, the composition is not densely clustered in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there only one character (derived from the green block) that differs in color or design from the surrounding characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a character that stands out in terms of color and design â€” the central figure holding a green block with a red rose. This contrasts with the surrounding red heart-shaped characters, corresponding to the unique green block in Image A among red blocks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the characters derived from the blocks retain any visual indication of interlocking mechanisms (such as recessed areas or connectors)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters do not display visual indicators of interlocking mechanisms like recessed areas or connectors, unlike the individual block designs evident in Image A. The characters have smooth surfaces without visible interlocking features.",
    "answer": "No"
