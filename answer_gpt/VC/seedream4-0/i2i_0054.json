      "question": "Is the detailed texture of the elephant's skin, showing wrinkles and creases, preserved in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textured nature of the elephant's skin is evident through visible wrinkles and creases on its body. These details are characteristic of elephant skin and their visibility in the image suggests that this aspect has been preserved. The analysis was based on visual inspection, noting fine details such as the pattern and depth of the wrinkles typically associated with elephants.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elephant's posture, including the raised front leg and curved trunk, retained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the elephant's posture is clearly defined with a raised front leg and a downward-curved trunk, indicative of its walking stance or exploratory behavior. These elements of posture are key visual cues that have been maintained, pointing towards a preserved depiction of the elephant's movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the elephant's ears and trunk, consistent with its young age, maintained in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An examination of Image B reveals that the elephant displays smaller ears and a proportionally shorter trunk compared to a mature elephant, which is characteristic of juvenile elephants. These proportions, aligned with the expected attributes of a young elephant, suggest that these elements have been proportionately maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elephant positioned on the rock edge, with its legs and trunk maintaining their relative placement to the rock surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is visibly positioned near the edge of a rock, with its legs and trunk positioned in a manner that interacts directly with the rock surface (e.g., one leg lifted, trunk extending downward). This spatial relationship is a key aspect of its natural posture and positioning, which appears to be preserved in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant face towards the right side of the image, preserving its profile orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the elephant is facing towards the right side, maintaining a profile orientation that showcases its side view, including features like its ears and trunk. This direction and orientation are clearly preserved, indicating the retention of its original profile within the image context.",
