      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower depicted with its characteristic lattice iron framework, including the four arched legs and tapered spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is represented using a paper cut-out illustration technique, which simplifies and stylizes the structure. Despite this abstraction, the essential features of the Eiffel Tower are still recognizable: the four arched legs at its base and a distinctive tapered spire at the top. This design retains the essential structural elements that characterize the Eiffel Tower, even though it is stylized in paper art form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the rectangular reflecting pool positioned directly in front of the Eiffel Tower, aligned along the central axis of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflecting pool is clearly visible and is positioned in front of the Eiffel Tower structure. It is aligned along the central axis of the background setting, contributing to the symmetry of the composition. This aligned positioning mirrors traditional depictions of the area around the Eiffel Tower with the reflecting pool directly leading towards it.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pathways and tree arrangements in the foreground arranged symmetrically around the central axis leading to the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathways and trees are meticulously arranged to create a symmetrical composition. The pathways are depicted running parallel on either side of the central reflecting pool, flanked by trees, presenting a balanced, mirrored layout that leads the viewer's eye directly towards the Eiffel Tower in the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spire-shaped building visible in the distance to the left of the Eiffel Tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes simplified buildings arranged in a cityscape form. Among these, there are several structures with varying roof shapes, meant to resemble Parisian architecture. However, none distinctively represent a spire-shaped building as visibly prominent or distinct against the skyline, unlike what is presented in the original image.",

      "question": "Is the sun located in the upper-left portion of the sky, casting light from that direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visually depict the sun itself as an element in the sky. The paper cut-out depiction focuses on the architecture and landscape rather than exacting atmospheric details such as the sun's position. Therefore, no direct representation of the sun casting light from the upper-left is present in this edited illustration.",
