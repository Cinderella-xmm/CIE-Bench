      "question": "Are the bananas represented with their characteristic elongated curve and yellow color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are shown as stylized forms with exaggerated lines and solid colors typical of cartoon illustrations. The bananas are an elongated shape with a bright yellow color, matching the common representation of bananas. The curves are less natural, more exaggerated, and intentional due to the illustrative style. This matches the characteristic elongated curve and yellow color normally associated with bananas.",

      "question": "Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana holder is represented with a curved line suggesting a metal arm, typical in cartoon illustrations to represent metal surfaces. The lower part features a rounded shape with a different color and texture that suggests a base, likely intended to represent wood. This depiction aligns with the known design of banana holders which have a metal arm for hanging fruit and a wooden base for stability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are positioned such that they appear suspended from the metal arm, maintaining the look that they are being held by it. Despite the stylistic change to a cartoon appearance, the arrangement mimics how bananas would naturally hang from such a holder.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bananas shown in a bunch, connected at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas in the depiction are illustrated with their tops connected, consistent with how bananas grow and are commonly seen in a bunch. The simplified cartoon drawing keeps this detail, illustrating the concept of bananas as a connected bunch.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the wooden base of the banana holder retain its wood-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the banana holder is depicted with a flat color without intricate textural details. While it retains its circular shape suggesting a wooden base, the texture is simplified and does not mimic a realistic wood texture due to the artistic style. Instead, it relies on color to imply material. This is a departure from the actual wood grain texture seen in Image A.",
