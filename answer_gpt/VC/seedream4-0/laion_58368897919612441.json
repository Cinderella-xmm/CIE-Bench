      "question": "Are both corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes present and positioned at the upper corners of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural model depicted inside the glass sphere clearly shows two corner towers with domed roofs and weather vanes, positioned symmetrically at the upper corners of the structure. Thus, using common architectural knowledge, this setup is consistent with traditional tower designs, which typically feature such embellishments for style and functionality, such as weather direction indication. Therefore, the visual assessment of the model confirms the presence of these elements in their correct positions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the crenellated parapet running along the top edge of the tower intact and continuous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure inside the glass sphere features a crenellated parapet, the characteristic notched or battlemented parapet at the top edge, which is a standard feature of medieval fortifications used for defense. This parapet is visible as an uninterrupted or continuous row of square notches along the top edge of the tower, indicating that it is intact without breaks or damage.",

      "question": "Are the arched windows arranged symmetrically across the façade, including the triplet groupings above the main level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model within the sphere exhibits a symmetrical arrangement of arched windows along the façade, typical of historic building design which often emphasizes symmetry for aesthetic and structural balance. The visually consistent pattern includes a notable triplet of windows prominently situated above the main level, contributing to the symmetric layout.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a central arched entrance at ground level, directly beneath the central section of the façade, with a wooden drawbridge structure extending forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central section of the structure depicted inside the sphere contains an arched entrance at the ground level. However, the visible pathway leading to the entrance is a stone path rather than a wooden drawbridge. Thus, while the entrance is correctly placed and styled, the drawbridge-like expectation is not met with the construction shown.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone visible across the exterior walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower does not display any visible horizontal bands of alternating light and dark stone on its exterior walls. Instead, the walls appear to consistently utilize a similar tone of stone throughout, aligning with a uniform masonry pattern rather than alternating banding.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the tower maintain a tall, rectangular mass with two prominent corner towers projecting outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the tower as a miniaturized model showing a tall, rectangular main body with two distinct corner towers that project outward, a common feature in medieval fortress architecture designed for increased defensive functionality and aesthetic prominence. This structure, clearly visible in the model, accurately embodies these architectural principles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wooden drawbridge constructed with a crisscross lattice pattern of beams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation of the tower structure within the sphere lacks a wooden drawbridge entirely. The path leading to the entrance is a stone path, and there is no constructed element resembling a drawbridge with a crisscross lattice pattern observable in the image. This absence confirms that such a design detail is not present.",
