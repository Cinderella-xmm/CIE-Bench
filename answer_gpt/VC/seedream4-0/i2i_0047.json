      "question": "Is the train still primarily painted in blue-purple with a yellow front and red doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no train present as the primary subject is a person skateboarding in a futuristic cityscape with vibrant neon colors. When assessing Image A, the train features a blue and purple body, a yellow front, and red doors. Image B does not present any train imagery, indicating that these specific color patterns associated with the train are no longer visible.",

      "question": "Are the windows and doors on the train still arranged in their original positions and shapes as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a train, thus there are no windows or doors from a train to compare. Image A shows the train with distinct windows and doors. Since Image B lacks the presence of a train, there is no opportunity for the arrangement of windows and doors to be retained.",

      "question": "Does the train remain connected to the railway tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no train visible in Image B; instead, the focus is on a skateboarder within a city. Image A depicts the train connected to railway tracks. With Image Bâ€™s urban neon scene lacking a train entirely, connectivity to tracks is not applicable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a skateboarder, featuring skateboard wheels illuminated by neon lights. Image A includes the structure of train wheels visible under the carriages. As there is no train in Image B, the arrangement of train wheels from Image A cannot be maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a dynamic cityscape with neon-lit buildings and streets, lacking any direct infrastructure related to a railway or train station, such as bridges or platforms. Image A shows these elements around the train, but with the absence of a train in Image B, such infrastructure is also missing.",
