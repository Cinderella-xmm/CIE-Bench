      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis player is shown in a low, crouched position, similar to an athletic stance often adopted when preparing for rapid movement. This is inferred from the player's lowered body, knees bent, and body angled forward, which are typical indicators of someone bracing to react quickly.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the player's right hand grips a tennis racket, which is positioned close to the ground, aligning with a classic posture where a player is readying for action or play. The visual cue here is the direction and position of the racket relative to the player's hand.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a ball boy seated behind the player. Instead, the image is focused on the player, and the background does not include additional figures or details indicating the presence of a ball boy. The emphasis is solely on the player without other character interactions.",
