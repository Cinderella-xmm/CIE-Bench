      "question": "Is the pyramid visible in the background to the right of the Sphinx, with a clear triangular silhouette against the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly visible pyramid to the right of the Sphinx. The pyramid maintains its iconic triangular shape and is set against the backdrop of a colorful sunset sky. This matches the common visual representation of pyramids against the Egyptian sunset. Therefore, the answer is derived by observing the silhouette of the pyramid compared to its surroundings.",

      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, directly behind the Sphinx, emitting a bright circular glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the sun is visibly low on the horizon and situated directly behind the Sphinx. The sun emits a bright circular glow, which is further accentuated by the surrounding halo and has a visually strong presence in the composition, matching what one would expect from a sunset scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx, appearing illuminated with orange and pink hues from the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dense layer of clouds below the Sphinx that are colored with orange and pink hues, likely reflecting the sunset light. This creates an atmospheric effect where the clouds appear to be part of the landscape set against the setting sun, a common visual trope in sunset scenes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx facing toward the right side of the image, with its profile visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx is oriented towards the right of the image. Its profile, including the main features like the lion body and the wings, is visible facing in that direction. This orientation is consistent with traditional depictions of Sphinx statues, where they are often shown in profile.",

      "question": "Does the sky show a smooth gradient from warm orange near the horizon to cooler purple and pink tones at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B exhibits a gradient transition, characterized by warm orange hues near the horizon, smoothly shifting to cooler shades of purple and pink as the view moves upward. This gradient is typical of a sky during sunrise or sunset, where sunlight casts different tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface details of the Sphinx do not prominently showcase horizontal erosion lines or layered textures typical of wear on ancient structures. Instead, the image depicts a more stylized and golden surface due to its artistic representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area around the Sphinx is primarily depicted with clouds, and there isn't a clear presence of sand near the base of the Sphinx, especially around the front paws or lower body. The setting emphasizes clouds and ethereal elements rather than a terrestrial sandy base.",
