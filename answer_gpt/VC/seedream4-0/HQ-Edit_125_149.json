    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the river present beneath the bridge, flowing from the background toward the foreground with visible white water over mossy rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a river flowing from the background to the foreground beneath the structure created by the natural formation resembling a bridge. The water flows over rocks with visible white water, indicating the presence of rapids or small waterfalls, which is typical in rivers with uneven rocky beds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there moss-covered rocks visible in the river, especially near the center and right side of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river prominently features rocks that have moss growing on them, which are especially visible near the center and right side of the image. This detail suggests a natural and lush environment where moss thrives in humid conditions often found beside flowing water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple fallen logs visible along the left and right riverbanks, some partially submerged in the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows fallen logs along both sides of the riverbank; some are partially submerged. These logs generally indicate a natural forest setting where trees fall and get caught along the edges of rivers, becoming entwined with the structural elements of the environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a canopy of green leaves overhead, allowing dappled sunlight to filter down onto the bridge and river?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a dense canopy overhead, casting filtered sunlight onto the scene below. The dappled light effect suggests sunlight streaming through leaves, creating patches of light and shadow on the river and natural sculpture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there several large, moss-covered tree trunks leaning toward the bridge from the left bank, with one prominently curving over the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are thick tree trunks visible on the left side, evidently covered in moss, adding to the forest-like ambiance. Although these trunks do not lean in the same manner as the original image's trunks and integrates differently by becoming part of the bridge transformed into a tree-like figure, creating an organic yet surreal stimulus.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image captured from a low-angle viewpoint, looking upward at the bridge from near the river level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is captured from a low angle, granting an upward view of the central figure, which is a tree-like entity. This perspective emphasizes height and scale and typically leads the viewer's eye up toward towering structures such as this. The river appears to be closer to the viewer's vantage point, reinforcing this viewpoint.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the bridge structure extend horizontally across the river, supported by towers on both sides, forming a continuous span?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no conventional bridge structure extending horizontally across a river with towers. Instead, the 'bridge' has been transformed into a large, tree-like figure that incorporates elements of the original bridge but lacks the symmetrical horizontal span we associate with typical bridges.",
