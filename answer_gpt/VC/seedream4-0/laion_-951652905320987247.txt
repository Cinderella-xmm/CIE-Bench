    "Question": "Q1: Is the mountain depicted as a symmetrical, perfectly conical shape with a pointed peak?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain within the glass bowl is not a perfect cone but rather a range of mountains with peaks, as can be observed from the varying heights and shapes of the peaks. Peaks in mountain ranges are typically more irregular compared to a solitary conical peak, such as Japan's Mount Fuji.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the summit of the mountain have a continuous white snow cap covering the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain's summit is indeed covered with a layer of snow. The snow appears to extend from the peaks down to cover parts of the slopes, suggesting a continuous snow cap, particularly notable because the snow is enhanced with glitter for effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a clear, mirror-like reflection of the mountain in the lake below?",
    "explanation": "Image B does show a reflection of the mountain in a body of water within the bowl, but it is neither as detailed nor as clear compared to the typical mirror-like reflections seen in large bodies of water. The reflection is subdued and lacks sharp detail, likely due to the miniature scale within the glass bowl.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small structures or buildings positioned along the edge of the lake, between the water and the mountain base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are small cabin-like structures positioned along the edge of the lake, suggesting human habitation at the mountain's base within the artistic scene inside the glass bowl.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky visible above the mountain, appearing as a solid or gradient blue area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the scene inside the glass bowl is a clear blue sky, which serves as the backdrop for the mountain and is consistent with how a real sky would appear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible layers on the mountainâ€™s slopes, showing a transition from white snow at the top to darker rock and then to green/brown vegetation below?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the mountain summit is covered with snow, there isn't a notable transition to darker rock and then vegetation. The slopes beneath the snow are simulated with glitter and do not depict distinct layers transitioning to vegetation. Instead, there are simply trees below the snowy area.",
    "answer": "No"
