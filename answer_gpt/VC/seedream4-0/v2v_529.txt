    "Question": "Q1: ** Is the subject depicted in a horizontal plank pose, supported by hands and toes? **",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO-style figure inside a glass case alongside a dog figure. Unlike Image A, this representation lacks the ability to depict a pose involving physical exercise or support on hands and toes. LEGO figures are typically depicted in a standing or static position. Therefore, the concept of a plank pose doesn't apply here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: ** Is the subject wearing a sleeveless tank top and shorts? **",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure is designed to mimic attire seen in athletic wear, indicated by the printed design resembling a tank top and shorts. Similarly, Image A features an individual wearing a sleeveless tank top and shorts. The similarity in attire between the LEGO depiction and the real-life image supports the conclusion that both represent athletic clothing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: ** Does the background maintain a clean and minimalistic aesthetic? **",
    "explanation": "Image B has a background that is clean and simple, with neutral tones provided by the glass case and subtle lighting, creating a minimalistic look. This aligns with the typical presentation style for collectibles or display items, where the focus is on the objects rather than the surroundings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: ** Are the subject's muscles visibly defined, indicating physical strength? **",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a LEGO figure which inherently lacks the anatomical detail to display muscle definition. Unlike Image A, where a real person shows defined muscles, a LEGO figure cannot depict physical strength through muscular detail due to its simplistic block-like design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: ** Is the subject looking upward, conveying focus and determination? **",
    "explanation": "The LEGO figure in Image B has a face blurred, and generally, LEGO figures have a fixed forward-facing expression. Without specific articulation, it's impossible for a LEGO figure to look upward or convey emotions like focus or determination. This differs from Image A, where the position and facial expression might suggest such emotions.",
    "answer": "No"
