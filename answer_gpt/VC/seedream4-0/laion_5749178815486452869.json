      "question": "Does the open umbrella retain its circular canopy shape with visible radial ribs converging at a central hub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open umbrella has a circular canopy shape, which is a typical feature of umbrellas. The radial ribs are the structural elements that extend from the central point or hub and support the fabric of the umbrella. Upon examining Image B, radial ribs converging at a central hub are indeed visible, forming this characteristic shape. These elements provide both the circular structure and visual cues for identifying an open umbrella.",
