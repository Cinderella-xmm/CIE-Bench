    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the original seam lines (including those around the front pocket and vertical panel divisions) preserved as embossed linear patterns on the transformed glass vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a glass vessel with embossed patterns that resemble seam lines typically found on fabric items like luggage. These linear patterns are visible across the surface of the glass, suggesting a design inspired by seam lines. The analysis combines visual cues, such as the rectangular divisions on the glass that mimic stitching patterns, with the common design elements used to create continuity from fabric to glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned near the top center of the front face of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a logo is clearly etched near the top center of the front face of the glass object. This positioning is a typical choice for brand visibility, often seen in product designs. Analyzing the visual cue that involves central placement at the top of a panel, along with branding strategies that prioritize logo visibility, supports this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the metallic spray nozzle located at the top center of the object, aligned vertically with the original handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a metallic spray nozzle right at the top center of the glass object. This position is consistent with where handles are commonly attached on similar objects like the luggage in Image A. The alignment suggests functionality (central placement for spraying) coupled with practical design considerations for balance and usability, similar to handle placements for carrying ease.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are four decorative caps present at the base corners of the transformed object, corresponding to the original wheel positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed glass object in Image B features decorative caps at its base corners. These visually correspond to the structural elements often added for support and balance in designs and align with typical wheel positions in objects like luggage. The analysis stems from recognizing functionality in both wheeled bases and stability-enhancing embellishments.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two zipper tracks of the front pocket preserved as linear features on the transformed object, maintaining their parallel alignment and position within the front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals linear features on the front panel that seem parallel and positioned similarly to the zipper tracks commonly found on fabric objects like luggage. This design adaptation retains the linear aesthetic and provides continuity. The analysis considers typical zipper placements as visual anchor points in designs that transition from fabric to rigid materials.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a handle present on the right side of the transformed object, corresponding to the original side handle’s position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass object does not feature a handle on the right side. This absence suggests an adaptation of the object that prioritizes aesthetic shifts rather than practical carrying elements aligned with the original side handle position. The thinking process involves recognizing handle placements typical to luggage and contrasting them with decorative or structural elements in the transformed design.",
