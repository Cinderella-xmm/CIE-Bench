      "question": "Is the woman’s facial profile, including the shape of her nose, jaw, and eyes, preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a LEGO figure with distinct facial features typical of LEGO figures. Given these features, the image does not represent a realistic woman's facial profile, as shown in Image A. The shape of the nose, jaw, and eyes differs significantly from human features. Therefore, any typical human facial profile is not preserved in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman’s hair light brown in color and styled in a braid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure has a hairstyle that appears simplified and stereotypical of LEGO figures, styled with molded plastic. The hair color on the LEGO figure resembles brown, similar to Image A, but not styled in a braid. The molded shape does not reflect the braided style visible in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the shirt and vest rendered in the original beige and olive-green colors, respectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure wears what seems to be a vest in a brownish color, which differs from the olive-green vest in Image A. Additionally, LEGO figures generally do not replicate fabric textures or natural color hues; the rendering of beige seems absent in this LEGO styling.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands positioned on a control mechanism in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure is posed on a LEGO ship, not in a controlling position. By comparison, Image A shows a human figure interacting with what seems to be a control mechanism or vehicle. The action posture and setting have changed, implying the hands aren't positioned the same way.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the straps and buckles of the tactical vest visibly present and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s LEGO figure has a vest that is simplified and stylized in LEGO brick form. It lacks the detailed visual presence of straps and buckles like those in Image A. LEGO figures inherently feature less detail due to their plastic form and are not made to capture intricate specifics like tactical gear.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the woman’s skin tone and facial expression (calm, focused) preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO figure in Image B has the standard yellow LEGO skin tone and a simplified, generic facial expression typical of LEGO minifigures. These attributes contrast sharply with realistic human expressions and skin tones shown in Image A. Therefore, neither the skin tone nor the facial expression is preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the woman have blue-gray eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure features typical black dot eyes that differ greatly from any realistic human eye color, such as blue-gray. This design element is characteristic of LEGO figures which simplifies and abstracts human features.",
