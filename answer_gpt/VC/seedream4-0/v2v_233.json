      "question": "Is the leaf in the edited image still ovate with a pointed tip and serrated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distinct shape of the leaf is clearly visible within the snow globe. The leaf maintains its ovate form, characterized by broad width at the center, narrowing towards a pointed tip, and serrated edges along the sides. This is consistent with the general shape and physical structure commonly associated with similar types of leaves. The visual cues strongly indicate that these features remain intact post-editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain the prominent central vein with branching secondary veins forming a network across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the leaf within the snow globe shows distinct veining, indicative of a prominent central vein that runs longitudinally, with secondary veins branching off to form a network. This characteristic is typical of many leaves, allowing for nutrient transport and structural integrity. The preserved veining pattern signifies that these features remain unchanged after the edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leaf still golden-yellow with visible brown speckles and natural discolorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the leaf inside the snow globe retains its golden-yellow hue, a common coloration for autumn leaves. Furthermore, brown speckles and subtle discolorations are evident, indicative of the leaf's aging process, a natural occurrence in such leaves. The presence of these visual markers suggests that the pigmentation and minor surface imperfections are preserved in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the leaf retain its papery texture and minor surface imperfections such as blemishes or spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the leaf with textural details that imply a papery, delicate surface, often associated with dried leaves. The visible blemishes or spots reflect its natural wear and tear. This ensures the leaf maintains the same texture and imperfections as observed physically in similar leaves, supporting the conclusion that these features are retained in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf oriented with the stem pointing toward the upper left and the blade extending diagonally across the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the leaf is positioned within the snow globe such that the stem indeed points toward the upper left, with the blade extending diagonally across the frame. This orientation matches a common positioning of leaves, providing a natural and balanced appearance within its contained environment, affirming that the orientation remains the same post-edit.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the leaf the sole central object in the edited image, without any other competing elements in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the snow globe encapsulates the leaf as the primary focus, centered and clearly highlighted by surrounding elements such as snowflakes and sparkles, which enhance but do not compete with the leaf's central presence. While there are decorative aspects within the globe, the design ensures these serve as complementary, leaving the leaf as the dominant central object without competition in the foreground.",
