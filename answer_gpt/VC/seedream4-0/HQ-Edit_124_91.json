      "question": "Is the bindi present on the dancer's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A bindi is a traditional decorative mark worn by women in South Asia on their foreheads, typically associated with Indian culture. In the edited image B, based on my observation, there is no clear indication of a bindi on the dancer's forehead. The central region of the forehead seems bare of any decorative mark. Therefore, given these visual cues, it's likely that the bindi is not present.",

      "question": "Does the dancer have dark braided hair secured with decorative pins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the dancer in Image B, the hairstyle appears consistent with a cultural or historical style, featuring what could resemble an elaborate arrangement rather than a simple dark braided hair style. Specifically detailed pins that typically feature in traditional Indian attire do not appear to hold any visible braider style hair. Therefore, the dancer in Image B doesn't seem to have a dark braided hair secured with decorative pins.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Floral garlands, often made of white flowers like jasmine, are a common accessory in traditional Indian hairstyles. In the edited image B, examining the left side of the dancer's head, there is a prominent white ornamental piece that looks like a floral arrangement, suggesting the presence of a garland-like decoration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A golden ornament on the crown is a characteristic feature in many traditional attires, symbolizing prestige and ceremonial attire. Observing Image B, the dancer's head features a decorative element that appears intricate and regal, corresponding to a golden ornament located at the crown, enhancing the grandeur of the ensemble.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A side profile view would show the features of the dancer's face in profile, with one side of the body oriented toward the viewer. In Image B, the dancer is positioned such that her body is angled but not fully in profile, and she is not facing to the right but rather in a frontal pose. This indicates that the dancer is not in a side profile view facing to the right.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is captured in a pose that conveys the grace of dance, with movements often including elevated limbs. The right leg is visibly raised, with a slightly bent knee and the foot elegantly pointed downward, exemplifying typical dance gestures.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of dance movements often includes a balance of grace and strength, characterized by posture. In Image B, the dancer's posture is upright with a slightly twisted torso and noticeable elevation of the leg, indicative of a poised, balanced dance stance.",
