        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an illustration where the brand name 'Karls' is prominently displayed on the label of a jar filled with pumpkin spice popcorn. The label is easy to read and stands out due to its central placement and the contrast with the background.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn contained in a clear glass jar with a silver metal lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an illustration of a popcorn jar. The jar appears clear, suggesting it is made from glass, but without a defined metal lid depicted as silver. The focus of Image B is more conceptual and cartoonish compared to a realistic portrayal.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature realist items like a ceramic bowl with a blue rim. It uses cartoon bowls in various colors, none of which match the description exactly. Instead, it focuses on a stylized look with cartoon-like bowls and popcorn.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the cartoon representation of popcorn and processes, and there is no depiction of a separate jar containing unpopped kernels. The image highlights the magical journey of popcorn rather than presenting accurate storage details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a warm color palette that includes orange prominently for the pumpkin theme and emphasizes it in the popcorn and label areas, although brown is not dominant compared to orange. The image maintains a light and playful tone.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a white surface illustrated with graphics and cartoon representations, lacking any wooden texture or element. The tone of the illustration is more imaginative and does not include realistic elements like wooden surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a cartoon style to illustrate popcorn but does not show kernels scattered around a jar. The focus is on the themed journey of the popcorn, rather than a realistic scenario with scattered kernels.",
