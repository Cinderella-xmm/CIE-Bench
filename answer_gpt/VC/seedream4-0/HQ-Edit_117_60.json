      "question": "Are both the main triangular sail and the smaller jib sail present and correctly positioned on the mast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B shows a model of a traditional sailboat with clearly visible sails. The main triangular sail is large and prominently displayed, attached to the mast as expected. Additionally, the smaller jib sail is positioned correctly, angled towards the bow. Sailboats usually have multiple sails configured to catch the wind effectively, which aligns with the traditional configuration observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single vertical mast located centrally along the length of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, there is a single mast rising vertically from the deck that appears to be centrally located along the length of the boat. The mast's position is typical in traditional sailboats, aiding in effective sail support and wind capturing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat have a sharply pointed bow extending forward from the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining image B, the boat's bow features a sharp point extending forward from the hull. This pointed design is characteristic of many traditional sailing vessels designed for effectiveness in slicing through water, enhancing navigational efficiency.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a covered section with open sides and vertical railings located over the midsection of the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a boat with a covered section at the rear (stern) rather than midsection, which has open sides with arches resembling vertical railings. This design resembles a traditional covered area often used for passenger seating or cargo protection, but not precisely over the midsection.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small red flag attached to the stern of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the model of the sailboat has a small red flag attached at the stern. Flags at the stern are commonly seen on boats for identification and ceremonial purposes; they are easy to spot due to their contrast against the boat's structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sails, mast, deck, and bow aligned in their original spatial configuration, maintaining the correct proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the boat with the sails, mast, deck, and bow in a plausible and logical spatial arrangement for a traditional sailboat. The proportion and orientation are correct regarding a typical sailing model, indicating no modification in their critical spatial configuration. Comparison with image A would support this aligned setup without noticeable change.",
