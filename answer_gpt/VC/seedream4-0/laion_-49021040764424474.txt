    "Question": "Q1: Is the 'Wildtrak' badge visible on the lower side fender of the vehicle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle is constructed from Lego bricks, which limits the level of detail that can be captured. The surface is made up of orange Lego bricks without distinct text or branding visible, which would likely be absent in a Lego model due to scale or detail limitations. In Image A, the real pickup truck has the 'Wildtrak' badge above the rear wheel at the lower side fender, which is clearly visible. By comparing both images, it's clear that Image B does not have a visible 'Wildtrak' badge.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the tailgate fully lowered, exposing the truck bed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rear of the Lego vehicle shows the tailgate lowered flatly, showing the exposed truck bed constructed from black Lego bricks. The same is true for Image A, where the real truck's tailgate is similarly fully lowered, revealing the truck bed. Thus, both vehicles have their tailgate fully lowered.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there two rear doors visible on the passenger side of the truck?",
    "explanation": "Image B, being a detailed Lego model, represents a pickup truck with two rear doors on the passenger side, identified by the outline of the orange bricks and the clear indication of a four-door cab. Image A also shows a traditional four-door truck cab. Both images depict a passenger side with two visible rear doors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the rear taillights have a vertical orientation with a red upper portion and clear lower section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Lego model's rear taillights are vertically oriented but appear entirely red due to the limitations of using Lego bricks, which do not precisely replicate fine details like clear sections. Image A, showing the real truck, has vertically oriented taillights with a distinct red upper portion and clear lower section. Thus, Image B does not have the clear lower sections visible.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is a roof rack visible on top of the cab?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, small segments of black Lego bricks align atop the cab, resembling a roof rack's structural elements. In Image A, a real roof rack is visible on the truck cab, confirming the presence and design. Both images have a roof rack visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there black trim running along the edge of the windows and the bed surround?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays minor black Lego bricks delineating the window edges and framing the bed, simulating the appearance of black trim often found on vehicles. Image A also shows actual black trim surrounding the real vehicle's windows and bed. Therefore, both images include the depiction of black trim.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the rear wheels positioned within distinct wheel arches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rear wheels of the Lego vehicle are clearly positioned within arches formed by the arrangement of Lego bricks. Image A also shows the real truck's rear wheels situated within defined wheel arches. Hence, both vehicles have rear wheels placed within distinct wheel arches.",
    "answer": "Yes"
