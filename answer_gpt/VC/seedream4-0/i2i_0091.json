      "question": "Is the original lighting style, including the placement and intensity of shadows, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large interior space with shadows from the windows cast on the floor. The shadows are relatively intense due to the amount of natural light flooding in from the windows. In Image A, the lighting is also natural, with shadows cast from objects on the furniture and wall. However, the setting differs greatly, leading to different shadow arrangements and intensities based on the architecture and window placement. This indicates changes in environmental lighting setup, not preserved.",

      "question": "Are the items on the chest of drawers arranged in a similar fashion to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a vast architectural space without furniture, while Image A shows a chest of drawers with specifically arranged items on top, such as books and vases. Since Image B lacks a chest of drawers, no arrangement can be compared, indicating the absence of similar arrangement in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the wooden parquet flooring texture still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features wooden parquet flooring of a patterned design, evident through the visible texture and arrangement of wood pieces. Image A displays a different scene indoors but does not reveal its flooring type as prominently as in Image B. Thus, the texture of parquet flooring is confirmed present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an open space with stone architecture and no visible furniture, enhancing its architectural and artistic character. Image A includes a chest of drawers, which serves as a storage unit. Absence of such a furniture piece in Image B suggests a change in scene type and furniture presence.",

      "question": "Is natural light still illuminating the scene from the same direction as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows are cast by natural light entering from certain directions that allows patterns to form on the floor from the windows. Image A shows light casting shadows mainly from the side, indicated by the angles on furniture and wall. If Image B shows light from a different angle or placement, it suggests a possible change in direction or angle.",
