    "Question": "Q1: Are the individual flower petals shaped like elongated, recurved lily petals with six distinct segments per bloom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the petals of the flowers are highly stylized and appear as crystalline structures with angular facets. They do not resemble natural lily petals, which are usually elongated and recurved with smooth, natural curves. Instead, the petals in Image B appear more geometric and crystalline. Therefore, they do not have the six distinct segments per bloom that resemble real lilies.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the bouquet arranged in a tightly packed, spherical cluster with multiple flowers overlapping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet of crystalline flowers is indeed arranged in a spherical cluster, with the flowers positioned closely together, creating an overlapping and dense appearance. This tightly packed arrangement is characteristic of spherical bouquets.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a transparent, cylindrical glass vase holding the bouquet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet is depicted in a transparent vase that appears cylindrical in shape. The visibility of the stems/rods and the clear structure of the vase confirms its transparency. This matches the description of a transparent, cylindrical glass vase.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase positioned directly beneath the bouquet, with stems/rods extending upward from it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is positioned directly beneath the bouquet, and the stems or rods extend upward from the vase into the bouquet, supporting the arrangement above. The positioning aligns with a typical bouquet placement in a vase.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there approximately ten to twelve flowers visible in the bouquet, including both open blooms and closed buds?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bouquet consists of a large number of stylized, crystalline flowers. The quantity appears to exceed ten to twelve flowers. The packed arrangement makes it difficult to count precisely, but visually, it seems to display more than the specified range. Additionally, the edited image focuses less on natural blooming stages like open blooms and closed buds.",
    "answer": "No"
