      "question": "Is the road still present in the image, with the same pathway direction and surface characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road is visible, running parallel to the fence and grass, indicating the direction is consistent with a linear pathway. The surface characteristics, like texture and color, appear unchanged and match common outdoor roads. Image A also shows a similar road under identical lighting and natural conditions. Thus, the pathway direction and surface features remain consistent with Image A.",

      "question": "Is the rustic fence still correctly positioned along the edge of the field, dividing it from the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fence along the edge of the field parallel to the road, accurately separating the grassy field from the road. It follows common field layout practices, which use fences for separation. The position and alignment seem unchanged when compared with Image A, where the fence divides the same areas consistently.",

      "question": "Are the trees still present in their respective places, maintaining the natural backdrop of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, trees appear in the background, providing natural scenery and consistent placement relative to the road and fence. This aligns with common landscape compositions, where trees provide environmental context. Image A shows a similar scene with trees similarly positioned, maintaining the natural aspect of the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting remain consistent, with similar shadows cast on the road and grass as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B highlights shadows and brightness across the road and grass, consistent with early or late daylighting conditions. Shadows and lighting details, such as highlighted paths and tree shadows, align with natural shadow patterns. Comparison to Image A reveals identical shadow casting and lighting conditions, confirming the lighting consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grassy field still visible, with its lush texture and coverage around the road and fence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lush grassy field surrounding the remaining area outside the road, maintaining natural outdoor texture and appearance. This visual matches common field coverage, where grass is dense and surrounds infrastructure like roads and fences. Image A portrays this grassy field in similar distribution and coverage, affirming no significant change.",
