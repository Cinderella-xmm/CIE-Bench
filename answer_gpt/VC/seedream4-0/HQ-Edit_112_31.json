      "question": "Is there a white blaze running down the center of the horse's face from the forehead to the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a plush toy resembling a horse or another creature with similar characteristics, such as a mane. This toy does have a white area on its face suggesting a positional similarity to a white blaze that runs down the face of a typical horse from the forehead to the muzzle. Therefore, based on the visual cues of Image B suggesting the presence of white coloration in the central facial region, the answer is Yes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse have a large white patch on its left side, extending from the shoulder toward the flank?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy representing the horse has a significant white area across its belly, suggestive of what might be construed as extending from the shoulder towards the flank if the toy were positioned similarly to an actual horse. It lacks the clear visual articulation that would be seen in an actual horse but implies a similar positional patch. Therefore, the analysis from Image B suggests this patch is present. The answer is Yes.",

      "question": "Is the horse facing slightly to the left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toy in Image B is facing directly forward, towards the viewer, with no orientation preference towards the left side of the frame. Visually, it seems posed to face directly outward, rather than angled. Therefore, the creature is not oriented to the left in the frame. Hence, the response is No.",

      "question": "Are there multiple dandelion seed heads visible in the foreground, surrounding the horse’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple dandelion seed heads are visibly placed within the foreground environment surrounding the plush toy's seated position, symbolically around what might be considered its leg area and below its seated position. Hence, the response is Yes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a forest of tall coniferous trees visible in the background behind the horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a boxed scene with artwork representing a forest background. While abstract and fitted into a small display, the portrayal does include tall tree shapes suggestive of a forested environment, similar to coniferous trees. The answer is Yes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sunlight coming from the left side of the image, casting a golden glow on the horse’s mane and left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no indication of sunlight direction affecting the plush toy is evident; the lighting is consistent overall with no highlighted or shadowed area specific to the left. The depiction seems evenly illuminated without reference to sunlight casting or angles. Thus, the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the horse standing directly within the field of dandelions, with flower stalks reaching up to its legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays multiple dandelion seed heads artistically surrounding the plush toy, giving the impression of an environment rich in dandelions directly contacting the toy's base and its simulated legs area. Consequently, the toy is effectively 'standing' within this flowered representation. Hence, the response is Yes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Are both ears of the horse upright and pointing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush representation in Image B is depicted with two similarly shaped ears that are positioned symmetrically upright and pointed forward in relation to its face. Thus, they appear upright and forward-pointing. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
