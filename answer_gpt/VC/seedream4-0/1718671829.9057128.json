      "question": "Is there a bench positioned on the left side of the porch, facing inward toward the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an Art Deco style is applied, characterized by the geometric and metallic design elements. Despite this stylistic change, the basic structure and positioning of objects remain similar to realistic depictions. Based on the visual cue, the bench is still present on the left side of the porch and is indeed facing inward toward the cabin. This assessment is based solely on the visual layout wherein the object resembling a bench retains its position and orientation from a typical porch setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large vertical glass panel or sliding door on the front face of the cabin, emitting warm light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an entrance is visible on the porch area, which appears to be a door rather than a wall of glass. It emanates warm light, indicating that it's likely a door with a glass component. This is interpreted from the visualization of warm light usually seen in illuminated glass openings such as doors or windows. The warm light can suggest the presence of glass material that is permeable to light.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bright circular moon located in the upper right portion of the sky, above the distant hills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is a distinct and stylized circular shape in the sky. This object resembles a bright, circular moon, situated on the right side, albeit not aligned precisely with the upper-right corner due to artistic rendering differences. The general positioning aligns with the depiction above a mountainous landscape, common in images for representing the moon.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there vertical wooden support beams forming the porch structure directly in front of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the support structure is prominently metallic and stylistic due to the Art Deco influence but still maintains the upright, vertical formation in front of the cabin similar to a porch's architectural features. This suggests that while the material and style appear different, the functional component as a support remains.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible warm interior lighting emanating from within the cabin through the glass wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of warm interior lighting is clearly visible through an opening that appears to be a door rather than an entire glass wall. This indicates a similar illumination effect created when indoor lighting is present behind glass or open structures like doors.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an artistic and stylized rendition of the landscape in front of the porch, which includes decorative elements that resemble plants. Despite their stylized forms, these indications serve the purpose of mimicking flora, but detailed depiction such as small white blossoms is not explicitly clear, remaining more abstract.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there dark silhouetted hills or mountains visible in the background, below the moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Art Deco style uses geometric patterns to represent natural elements. The background contains jagged, dark shapes representing hills or mountains, positioned below and around the moon, consistent with typical landscape compositions.",
