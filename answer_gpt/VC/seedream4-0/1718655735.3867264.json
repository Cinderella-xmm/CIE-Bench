      "question": "Is the fairy depicted in a side profile pose, with her head slightly turned toward the viewer and her gaze directed forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fairy character in a frontal pose rather than a side profile. Her body is facing forward, and while her head orientation is not crane towards the viewer, this doesn't qualify as a side profile. Thus, the pose does not effectively suggest a side stance or a head turned towards the viewer.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dangling beaded earrings are visible on the character, hanging from the ears. Such accessories are commonly used in fantasy and elegant depictions to accentuate a character's ornamental appearance. Therefore, the earrings are apparent and present in the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurring of the facial area, it is not possible to confirm or refute the presence of closed eyes or red painted lips. The facial details necessary to answer this are obfuscated in the edited image.",
