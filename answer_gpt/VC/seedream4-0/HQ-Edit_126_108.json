      "question": "Are the two large dark boulders positioned in the foreground grassy area near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two large dark boulders visible in the foreground grassy area near the cliff edge. They are clearly positioned on the grassy terrain before the drop-off, providing a natural border to the cliff. This is readily observable as they stand out against the green of the grass, indicating a naturally occurring feature in such landscapes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a dirt path is clearly visible, snaking through the grass toward the cliff edge. This detail provides a sense of realism and perspective, guiding the viewer's eye through the scene towards the dramatic waterfall beyond. The path's presence is often typical in natural parks or scenic locations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are tree branches visible extending from the top-left corner into the frame. These branches appear to be casting shadows over the foreground, a common effect of sunlight filtering through trees, adding depth and a touch of realism to the landscape.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight appears to illuminate the scene from the right, casting a warm golden tone across the waterfall and the distant mountains. The lighting effect gives the scene a glowing, almost ethereal quality typical of sunrise or sunset scenarios in nature photography.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wide river is visible flowing across a flat plain above the waterfall. There are scattered green islands in the river, contributing to a scenic view typical of large river systems breaking into multiple channels or flowing through estuarine environments.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features dark, layered mountains under a partly cloudy sky. This detail adds depth to the landscape, creating a contrast between the rugged hills and the lighter sky, a common atmospheric depiction in expansive natural landscapes.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, mist is visibly rising from the base of the waterfall, diffusing into the air. This is a typical phenomenon in large waterfalls where the force of the water hitting the lower surface creates a spray or mist effect, contributing to the dramatic visual appeal of such landscapes.",
