      "question": "Does the edited image retain the trident with exactly three sharp, symmetrical prongs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trident is clearly visible and features a design with multiple sharp, symmetrical prongs. Using visual cues in Image B, combined with the general knowledge that a trident typically has three prongs, it can be concluded that this trident retains the characteristic structure. By comparing it to the usual depiction of tridents and not relying solely on Image A, it can be determined there are precisely three prongs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
