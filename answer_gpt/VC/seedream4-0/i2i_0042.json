      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a chibi-style figure with the arms raised, similar to the subject's arms-raised pose in the original image.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table has been modified to show one large burger with a pile of fries instead of multiple plates. The drinks and condiments are presented in simplified forms. While Image A shows several plates with food items spread across the table, Image B has transitioned these into a single illustrative mega meal. This change suggests a consolidation of the food items into an exaggerated form to match the chibi art style.",
