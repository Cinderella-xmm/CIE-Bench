      "question": "Does the puppy retain its fluffy golden-brown coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's coat maintains a similar texture and color throughout its body. The visual cues show a fluffy and consistent golden-brown hue, typical of some dog breeds known for such coats. This consistency aligns with the knowledge of such fur characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the puppy's dark, expressive eyes and facial structure preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B without considering the blurred region, itâ€™s challenging to assess the eyes and facial features directly; however, these features typically are prominent in dog portraits. Given the context, excluding the blurred area, there's insufficient evidence in Image B to affirm the preservation of these specific facial details accurately.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's front paws are clearly visible, showing a natural positioning with claws intact. The visual cues from the paws indicate fur-covered paws with claws, aligning with typical canine physiology.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog rests on a light blue cushioned surface, identifiable as a dog bed. This observation aligns with the characteristics of typical dog beds, showing a similar color and placement directly under the dog.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show the dog in a prone posture with its front legs extended comfortably forward. This relaxed positioning is typical of a resting or relaxed dog, indicating the dog is not in a state of alert or distress.",
