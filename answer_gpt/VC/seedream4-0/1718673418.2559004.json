    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the elevated rocky outcrop forming the base of the island still present with its original silhouette and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocky outcrop forming the base of the island has been transformed into the roots of a giant tree, giving the appearance of the town being on a floating island. This changes the silhouette and the perceived position compared to a solid landmass base. Thus, it does not have the original silhouette or position as depicted in conventional scenarios.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the houses arranged in a dense, tiered cluster ascending the slope of the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the houses are indeed arranged close together, stacked in a tiered manner as they ascend upwards, following the slopes and the growing roots of the giant tree. This tiered arrangement is a representation of a densely packed village on a hill. The structure maintains the traditional concept of building placement in tiered formations.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible road that connects the dock to the main cluster of houses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no dock because the landmass has been transformed into a floating island. Without a dock as seen in Image A, there is similarly no visible road connecting a non-existent dock to the houses.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden dock structure extending from the island into the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a traditional water body beneath a dock structure as in Image A. Instead, the scene has been transformed into a floating island above clouds without any visible water or dock structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there trees visible in the foreground on both the left and right sides of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no trees visible in the foreground, as the setting has changed to a fantastical floating landmass with whimsical elements like giant mushrooms and a large tree. The view does not show any traditional trees occupying the foreground space on either side.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there large mountain peaks visible in the background behind the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features large mountain peaks in the background, similar to Image A. These peaks provide a dramatic backdrop beyond the transformed floating island.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the sunlight come from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting suggests that the sunlight is indeed coming from the upper left, casting shadows toward the lower right. This is evident from the shadow placements on the buildings and the overall illumination direction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the buildings have red-tiled roofs and wooden walls with earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows buildings that retain the characteristics of red-tiled roofs and wooden walls with earthy tones, similar to that typically seen in European village aesthetics.",
