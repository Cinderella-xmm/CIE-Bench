      "question": "Does the image retain the natural wool texture of the sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep are illustrated in a cartoon style, which typically simplifies and stylizes features. The wool texture is depicted as a simple, fluffy outline rather than a realistic texture seen in actual sheep. This suggests a focus on stylistic representation rather than realistic detail, which does not align with the natural texture seen in real sheep. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cue of the cartoonish feature, indicating a deviation from the realistic wool texture seen in typical depictions.",

      "question": "Do the sheep retain their darker facial and leg markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both sheep in a stylized manner with uniform colors and lacks any individualized markings typical of real sheep. The cartoon style uses consistent features across both figures, simplifying their appearance. Comparing the simplified and unified color scheme in Image B with real sheep would indicate a departure from the natural markings unique to each sheep, such as darker faces and legs seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the grassy field setting retained, including the distribution of sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon setting focused directly on the sheep, with no background elements such as fields or other sheep. The background is plain and uses pastel colors which do not mimic the natural environment seen in Image A. Therefore, none of the field elements or distribution of sheep seen in a typical habitat is present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the tree line marking the field's border retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any detailed background scenery that would signify a natural setting like a tree line. The simplified and abstract backdrop focuses only on the cartoon representation of two sheep interacting. The absence of any elements resembling trees or landscape icons typical of natural borders offers a clear indication that the tree line marking the field's border from Image A is not retained.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sheepâ€™s natural behaviors, such as grazing or standing, retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep are anthropomorphized and depicted engaging in activities such as holding tennis rackets and shaking hands, which are not natural behaviors for sheep. This imagery shifts from the natural behaviors of real sheep, such as grazing or standing, as seen in Image A, highlighting a significant stylistic transformation focused on creating an entertaining scene rather than realistic depictions.",
