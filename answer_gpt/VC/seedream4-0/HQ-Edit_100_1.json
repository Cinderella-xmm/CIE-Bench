    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tree's central position with a wide, spreading canopy and visible branching structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is crafted within a wooden frame, featuring a sculptural representation of a tree at the center. This tree has extensive branching visible, and the canopy spreads wide, which is common in scenic art pieces to mimic real-life structures. Given the artistic style, central positioning for both balance and aesthetic appeal is maintained.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the tree still displaying a visible gradient from green to orange and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the tree leaves predominantly in shades of orange and red, consistent with an autumnal theme, without the presence of a gradient starting from green. This gradient is not present due to the artistic representation of autumn.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the meadow clearly divided into a pink/red floral area on the left and a green daisy-filled area on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a contained environment lacking a vast meadow. The bottom part showcases various floral arrangements, yet does not demonstrate a clear left-right division of distinct floral areas as described. The artistic setting confines such segmentation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are white daisies still present in the green section of the meadow on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small white floral representations amidst the colorful patches beneath the tree, but these are not arranged to represent daisies in a meadow setting due to the crafted nature of the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible glow or backlight effect shining through the treeâ€™s leaves from behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, due to its contained diorama-like style, lacks the environmental lighting conditions found in open landscapes. There's no glow effect as the scene is lit uniformly within the box, focusing on details rather than natural lighting effects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tree's base visibly rooted in the ground of the meadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunk appears to rest on the bottom within the confines of the shadow box without visible roots merging into a meadow landscape, reflecting its crafted nature rather than organic rooting.",
