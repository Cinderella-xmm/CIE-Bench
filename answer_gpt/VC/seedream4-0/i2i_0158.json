        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car rendered in a consistent red color across all views. By analyzing the image, we can confirm the continuity of the red color, which is evident in all three views shown. The red paint appears to be the same shade and finish in all parts of the car body.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view shows the car's grille design, which includes horizontal slats and the Ford emblem centered in the grille. This detail is maintained accurately from what is commonly expected of a Ford Mustang, indicating the edited image retains the original design and emblem placement.",

      "question": "Are the same style and configuration of LED daytime running lights visible in both the front and side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LED daytime running lights are visible in the front view with a specific design. When analyzing the side views, the light design and configuration are not clearly visible, but based on common practice in automotive imaging, any visible LED lights would maintain consistency across views. However, without clearer visibility from the side, asserting identical appearance would be speculative.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the car's wheels in the front and side views, showing the alloy wheels' design, which appears identical across all visible angles. The specific design of the spokes and color remain consistent throughout each view, aligning with world knowledge that vehicles are typically depicted with uniform wheel designs in such images.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the views show the car from different angles. The body shape and proportions of the Mustang, characterized by its long hood and short rear, are accurately presented in all views. These proportions conform to the typical design features of a Mustang, ensuring the body shape remains consistent with the actual model across all depictions.",
