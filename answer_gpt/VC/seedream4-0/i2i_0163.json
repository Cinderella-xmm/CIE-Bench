        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are examined for their shape and surface characteristics. The visual cues indicate that they maintain a rectangular shape with smooth metallic surfaces, characteristic of the design observed in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the bread still rising slightly above the toaster slots with visible toast marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the slices of bread protruding from the toaster slots. The bread pieces have a toasted appearance with visible marks, indicating that they rise slightly above the slots similar to Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close inspection of Image B reveals the presence of black control knobs and levers on the front of both toasters. These controls are consistent with those visible in Image A, pointing to no change in their presence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toasters in Image B exhibit a metallic sheen that reflects the surrounding environment. This reflective quality is consistent with the sheen observed in Image A, which suggests continuity in the material appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are positioned next to each other on a surface, similar to their arrangement in Image A. This placement indicates no change in their relative positioning on the surface.",
