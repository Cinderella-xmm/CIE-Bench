        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style locomotive has a distinct rectangular grille at its front center, which serves as a design element for a cartoonish appearance. Analyzing Image A, a realistic locomotive is displayed, and it also features a rectangular grille at the front center typical for real locomotives. Both images share this detail, keeping the element consistent between the realistic and cartoonish styles.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi locomotive has a prominent, illuminated orange-yellow headlight, which is a common feature for trains in cartoons to mimic real headlights. In Image A, the realistic locomotive also has an illuminated headlight, matching the described feature from Image B. Thus, the presence of a headlight is consistent in both images.",
