      "question": "Does the clock tower retain its hexagonal shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the tower remains hexagonal, as evidenced by the six-sided design visible from the perspective shown. This geometry is usually associated with towers and structures that have a symmetrical and polygonal basis, commonly seen in clock towers or similar edifices. The hexagonal shape allows for a variety of architectural designs that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.",

      "question": "Is the clock face still present with Roman numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is clearly visible and retains the traditional Roman numerals for indicating time. Roman numerals I through XII are typically used on classical clock faces to denote the hours, which is consistent with the style shown in both image A and B. This type of clock face is a common design that has been used historically and is often chosen for its classic and elegant appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tower still have a balcony with balusters below the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balcony structure with balusters is evident beneath the clock face. The design of the balcony consists of a railing with vertical supports, known as balusters, which is a typical architectural feature providing both safety and decoration. The presence of snow does not obscure the structural elements enough to misinterpret the existence of the balcony.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tower retain its pointed roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of snow, the pointed shape of the roof is discernible. Pointed roofs are common in clock towers, designed to shed water and snow efficiently, which is consistent with its function and aesthetic. Compared to Image A, the snow doesn't alter the fundamental shape of the roof, which remains pointed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tower retain its green and yellow color scheme, excluding the flags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tower predominantly in green and yellow, even with snow covering parts of the structure. The base colors are still visible and are a continuation of the color scheme seen in many similar architectural designs where vibrant color combinations are used for ornamental purposes. The snow presence alters only parts of the visibility, not the inherent color scheme.",
