    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the deep, blocky lug pattern of the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, which features a robotic creature, the tires appear to have a substantial tread pattern, similar to off-road tires. The deep, blocky lug patterns are consistent with tires designed for traction, which can be observed from the prominent tread details visible. This suggests retention of the original tire's feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the embossed text \"ROCKS TIRE\" and \"SUPER SWAMPER\" visible on the sidewalls of the tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image of the robotic armadillo-like creature, the focus is not primarily on the tire sidewalls, making it challenging to detect smaller details like embossed text. Given the common practice in design modifications and artistic representations to omit such textual details for aesthetic simplification, the text is not visible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the five-spoke designs of the wheel hubs still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the wheel hubs of the tires used by the robotic creature can be observed. The hubs feature a multi-spoke design which closely resembles the structure of a five-spoke configuration. It indicates that the key characteristic of the wheel hub design has been retained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the matte, rubber-textured surface of the tires maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows tires on the robotic creature that appear to have a non-reflective, textured surface resembling rubber. The matte finish and the visual cues of a rubbery texture suggest that the original tactile quality has been preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tread blocks evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original tires?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tread blocks on the tires in the edited image appear well-aligned and evenly spaced, maintaining a consistent pattern similar to what would be seen on precision-manufactured tires like those in the original image. This suggests adherence to the original spacing and proportional design of the treads.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly four tires, corresponding to the original stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a mechanical creature with four distinct wheels, corresponding to the typical number found on many vehicles and consistent with the quantity seen in the stack of original tires. This parallel suggests that the quantity has been retained.",
