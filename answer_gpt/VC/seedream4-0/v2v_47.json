      "question": "Does the edited image retain the semi-circular arrangement of seating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating is arranged in a semi-circular pattern, mimicking an amphitheater's traditional design. Common knowledge of amphitheaters suggests that this arrangement is characteristic to allow for better viewing of the stage. The color blocks maintain this semicircular shape, indicating the same arrangement is preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the tiered wall with arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design showcases tiered walls with multiple rows of arches, similar to structures like coliseums. Knowledge of such architecture includes the use of arches for structural support and aesthetic purposes, and this is visually maintained in the edited image with color variation being the only change.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the relationship between the seating and the stage area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains a stage area that the seating semi-circularly surrounds, which is typical in an amphitheater setting. This spatial arrangement supports audience viewing angles and is depicted in both the original and edited images, indicating the maintenance of this relationship.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows evenly spaced arches along the tiered walls, a well-known feature in classical architecture for balance and visual appeal. Comparing with Image A, the edited image does depict evenly spaced arches, showing this characteristic is retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of Image B visibly mirrors the classic rounded and layered outline of an amphitheater. World knowledge of architectural shapes helps to conclude that despite colorful alterations, the basic layout and recognizable shape are preserved.",
