      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two figures depicted in a chibi (cartoonish) style are wearing jackets: one in red and the other in blue.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two figures are positioned side by side, oriented towards the direction of the forest path, which suggests that they are facing forward. This is visually indicated by the direction their heads and skis are pointing, consistent with the typical skiing pose of moving forward.",
