      "question": "Is the hull number \"J244\" clearly visible and positioned on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull number 'J244' is prominently visible and has been repositioned slightly upwards and appears slightly smaller due to the surrounding steampunk elements. Using world knowledge, hull numbers typically identify individual ships, and thus are placed on the hull for clear visibility.",
