        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the croissant located on the map retains a golden-brown color and apparent flaky texture, which are characteristic traits observed in well-baked croissants. These visual cues suggest that the same quality has been preserved compared to typical croissants. Comparatively, referring to Image A, the croissants also exhibit this distinct golden-brown appearance and flaky texture. Thus, the characteristic attributes of the croissants, such as color and texture, remain consistent between the two images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cupcakes still display the swirl pattern on their frosting, which is a common decorative style for cupcake frostings. The visual representation of these swirls is distinct and matches typical cupcake frosting designs. When comparing with Image A, the original also depicts cupcakes with similar swirl frosting patterns. Therefore, the swirl pattern of the cupcake frosting is retained in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cupcake frostings with pink and blue colors clearly visible, similar to those found in conventional decorative frostings. The yellow frosting is less distinct because the location and visibility have changed due to the edited background, but a small part appears in the upper right. When comparing with Image A, these cupcakes possess equally vibrant pink, blue, and yellow frosting colors. Consequently, the original color scheme is retained within the region visible in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not prominently feature the tartlets as seen in Image A. Instead, the focus has shifted to different components of the set, including cupcakes and croissants, accompanied by a treasure map motive. Thus, the red and blue berries, which are visible toppings on the tartlets in Image A, do not appear in Image B, indicating they are not retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B organizes the desserts around a thematic map with a scattered arrangement of the featured items like croissants and cupcakes, significantly differing from the linear and orderly arrangement of clumped croissants, cupcakes, macarons, and tarts seen in Image A. Therefore, the original positions and groupings of desserts are not preserved in the edited version.",
