        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is depicted holding a hammer that has a visible blue lightning effect emitting from it, indicating it still retains the glowing attribute commonly associated with Thor's hammer. Image A also shows a similar glowing hammer in the person's hand. Given that the lightning effect is present in both images, based on visual cues and knowledge of Thor’s iconic weapon, Mjolnir, the answer is yes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine possesses long blond hair which is a typical characteristic of Thor, though the beard isn't visible due to the face being blurred.

      "explanation": "Image B depicts the figurine in a standing pose holding the hammer in an upright position, similar to a heroic stance.
