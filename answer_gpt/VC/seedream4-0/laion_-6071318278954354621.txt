    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the original woman’s facial features, including the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the facial features, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline, are not visible or discernible because they have been obscured or blurred intentionally. Given visual cues and common practice of blurring faces in images for anonymity or privacy, it is clear that these specific features cannot be retained visually in the edited version. Therefore, without referring to Image A, the edited image does not retain these features.",
