    "Question": "Q1: Are the two tall towers positioned symmetrically on either side of the central section?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, two tall towers are present on either side of a central section, giving the appearance of symmetry. Symmetry in architectural terms refers to a balanced and proportional similarity between two halves of an object. The visual cues from Image B suggest these towers are positioned with equal distance from the central section, thus maintaining symmetry.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a centrally located arched doorway with a wooden door beneath a rounded arch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the structure features an arched doorway with what appears to be a wooden door set beneath a rounded arch. The distinct shape and the material used indicate a typical architectural design for a doorway, which fits the description.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does a set of stone steps ascend from the water level directly to the arched entrance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is raised on a platform resembling a tabletop, rather than being set at a water level. The steps leading up to the arched entrance are composed of wood and originate from this platform instead of directly from water, differing from the stone steps described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there multiple rectangular windows with dark frames aligned vertically on each tower?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the towers consist of interlocking wooden blocks and do not feature any windows, dark-framed or otherwise. Their design is more akin to a puzzle rather than a structure with traditional window placements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the tops of both towers feature flat surfaces with crenellated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the towers are flat and are adorned with irregularly interlocking wooden blocks that simulate crenellated edges. This is architectural detailing that gives the appearance of fortification, commonly seen in castle designs, thus matching the description.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a low stone wall extending horizontally from the right side of the castle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior of the structure is composed of wooden elements, and no low stone wall is evident extending horizontally from the right side or any other part of the structure. The image instead focuses on the wooden construction and symmetry of the central towers.",
    "answer": "No"
