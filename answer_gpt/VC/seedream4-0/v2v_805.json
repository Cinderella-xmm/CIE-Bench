      "question": "Is the text \"STORY PAGES\" present in uppercase serif font above the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature the text 'STORY PAGES' in any visible form. Instead, it has a snow globe with an open book inside, and there are no text elements above the book, differentiating it from a design that might include typography. Using world knowledge about book representations, the focus is on the book within the globe, which excludes the presence of stated text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the book have a visible spine and two cover edges forming an open structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book inside the snow globe shows a depiction of an open book structure with visible pages and without a distinct spine or cover edges as would be expected in real books. The illustration of the book emphasizes pages more than distinct elements like spines or edges due to artistic choices.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple curved horizontal lines on both left and right sides of the book representing stacked pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the snow globe, the book has curved horizontal lines on both sides, simulating the appearance of stacked pages due to its artistic design. This is a visual strategy used to represent text in a simplistic manner on stylized book illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no text 'STORY PAGES' present. The focus is on a snow globe containing a book image. The image composition does not involve aligning the book with any specific text, unlike Image A which features such design-centered composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a warm lighting setup with a snow globe and surrounding aesthetic elements such as a bookshelf and lamp. The book inside does not follow a dark navy blue color scheme, and there are no text elements like in Image A. The background comprises more dynamic lighting and textures rather than a unified color.",
