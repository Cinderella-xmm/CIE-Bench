      "question": "Is the three-pointed star emblem present on the front grille?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a game controller rather than a car, but it features a design inspired by the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, evident from the iconic three-pointed star emblem located prominently in the center. This symbol, usually associated with the front grille of a Mercedes-Benz vehicle, is replicated on the controller, confirming its presence alluding to the original design inspiration.",

      "question": "Are the gullwing doors open upward from the roofline, hinged at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the game controller features elements designed to mimic the gullwing doors of a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, which open upward from the roofline, hinged at the top. These features are replicated in a creative manner on the controller, confirming the design inspiration and functionality at a conceptual level.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a vertical slit-shaped air intake on the side of the car, just behind the front wheel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the transformation of the car into a game controller, there are no physical car features like air intakes. The design focuses on gaming controller features rather than replicating elements like air intakes from a car.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"SLS\" badge visible on the side of the car near the rear wheel arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a modified design resembling a game controller, and lacks specific car details like a badge. The focus is on capturing the essence of the Mercedes design and does not extend to including detailed badges typically found on a car.",

      "question": "Do the wheels have a multi-spoke alloy design with a five-spoke pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature wheels at all, as it portrays a game controller. Therefore, the question about multi-spoke alloy design or any kind of wheel design does not apply.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As a gaming controller, Image B lacks traditional car interiors such as seats. The design aims to replicate the aesthetic influence of the car, focusing on external elements like coloring and shape rather than internal features like seats.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a game controller, which naturally omits automobile-specific features like a license plate. As a result, there is no context or space for a license plate to be represented.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The representation in Image B is a game controller that stylistically mirrors certain design elements of the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, most notably the color and emblem. However, structural car elements such as a low-slung, long-hooded silhouette are not applicable to its design form as a controller.",
