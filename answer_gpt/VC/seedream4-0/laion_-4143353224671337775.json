      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wide open mouth with visible white teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wide open mouth with visible white teeth is a prominent feature. The mouth is carved into a smile and has distinctly visible white teeth, suggesting it's a stylized representation of a face. The visual cues directly reflect the description.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black eyebrows present and positioned above the eye sockets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, black shapes above where the eye sockets would be can be interpreted as eyebrows, positioned consistently above where eyes would logically be placed on a stylized face representation. This placement is typical in many animated or artistic representations.",

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dark rounded shapes are visible on both sides of the head, interpreting these as stylized ears. The symmetry and typical ear positioning on a face support this identification.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two indentations where eye sockets would be, which are visually identified as circular eye sockets due to the symmetry and typical placement on the face.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the head features a distinct green patch, which provides a contrasting color to the otherwise earthy tones of the sculpture, making it a noticeable element.",
