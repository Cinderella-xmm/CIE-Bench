      "question": "Does the boy's face retain clear and recognizable features such as eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy's face is blurred, meaning there are no clear and recognizable features like eyes, nose, or mouth visible. The blurring effect creates an indistinct look, which is common when privacy is needed or to anonymize subjects. This alteration makes it impossible to discern facial details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all four original birds present, with the macaw on the shoulder, the cockatoo on the arm, the canary on the head, and the parakeet near the side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a visual inspection shows four birds positioned similarly to real-life counterparts in typical illustrations. The macaw is on the left shoulder, the cockatoo is on the right arm, the canary is sitting on top of the head, and the parakeet is near the side. Illustrations commonly optimize representation by emphasizing key characteristics, ensuring all elements from a real scene are maintained.",

      "question": "Is the cartoon print on the boy's green T-shirt still visible and intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there is an evident cartoon print visible on the boy's green T-shirt, displaying characters from the Angry Birds franchise. Illustrations typically maintain key design elements while simplifying or accentuating details. The cartoon stays visible and clear despite the artistic conversion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boyâ€™s head visibly larger compared to the shrunken size of the birds in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style of illustration affects relative size perception. Illustrations often simplify or stylize proportions; however, in this image, the proportions between the boy's head and the birds remain consistent with typical illustrated styles and the original image guidelines. The boy's head does not appear disproportionately larger when compared to the birds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature a thick white outline around the boy and the birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a thick white outline surrounding the boy and the birds. In illustrations, such outlines are commonly used to create a sticker-like or cut-out effect, enhancing the separation between the subject and the background. This detail aligns with stylized artistic choices, distinguishing the main figures in the image.",
