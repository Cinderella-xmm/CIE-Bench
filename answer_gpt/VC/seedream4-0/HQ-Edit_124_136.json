    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure seated in a cross-legged position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (second image) features a figure sitting on an ornate bench rather than on the ground. This indicates that the figure is not seated in a cross-legged position, as a bench would require a different sitting posture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right hand positioned above the strings in a plucking gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (second image), the figure's right hand is shown holding the harp, suggesting it's likely in a position to pluck the strings. The typical gesture for playing a harp includes raising the hand over the strings for plucking.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the left hand positioned on the neck of the instrument with fingers pressing the strings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (second image) shows the figure holding a harp, where there is no visible neck for holding like a lute or guitar. Therefore, the left hand would not be positioned on the neck pressing strings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure facing forward with the head slightly tilted upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (second image), the posture and positioning suggest the figure holds a forward-facing direction, considering the interaction with the surroundings and instrument. A slight upward tilt is also common in such dignified portrayals.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (second image) presents a figure with a visible long, flowing white beard and mustache, consistent with typical representations of an elder or wise figure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure wearing a brown, textured turban?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (second image), the headwear appears more like an ornate, colorful mosaic-style crown or cap with intricate designs, rather than a brown, textured turban.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a visible soundboard area on the instrument?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (second image), the instrument is a harp, which does not have a traditional soundboard like stringed instruments such as guitars or lutes. Instead, harps have an open frame.",
