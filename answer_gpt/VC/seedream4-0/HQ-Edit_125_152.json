      "question": "Are the orange fields with black veins and white spots along the wing margins present in the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly has orange fields with defining black veins and white spots along the wing margins. This is typical of monarch butterflies and is depicted accurately in the edited image. The presence of these markings is an essential distinguishing feature of this species, and in the second image, these are clearly emphasized to maintain the butterfly's identity despite its animated character.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there clearly defined white spots located along the outer edge of both forewings and hindwings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings feature distinctly outlined white spots that are visible along the edges of both the forewings and hindwings. This patterning is characteristic of monarch butterflies and helps to visually separate the wing margins from the central orange fields. The edited image retains this feature, making it integral to the butterfly's depiction.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly’s body black with small white speckles distributed across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the butterfly in Image B is mostly black, featuring small white speckles that are recognizable characteristics of a monarch butterfly's body. In the edited version, the body color and pattern remain true to this natural presentation, enhancing its resemblance to the species in a more stylized and whimsical manner.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a flower with a spiky central cone and drooping petals beneath the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly hovering above a flower, which in the context of the scene, seems to have a spiky central cone and drooping petals, similar to a coneflower. These elements are visually communicated through their shapes and the manner in which the flower is depicted in the illustration. The artist has chosen this type of flower to complement the overall vibrant and artistic theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the flower, with its legs touching the bloom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is engaging with its environment but isn't directly above a flower with legs touching it as it was in Image A. The butterfly in the edited image is anthropomorphized, conducting a symphony, which implies it’s not in direct physical contact with the flower beneath it in a conventional manner. The artistic scene has the butterfly poised in a creative action rather than resting on the flower.",
