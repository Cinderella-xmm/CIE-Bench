    "Question": "Q1: Is the sunlight originating from the upper-left portion of the sky, casting diagonal rays across the mountain range?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light appears to originate from the upper-left portion of the sky, as inferred by the presence of diffused light rays spreading diagonally across the landscape. This is consistent with natural lighting phenomena where light disperses from a point source, likely the sun, and casts shadows and rays across the terrain.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible layers of mist or haze separating the mountain ranges at different depths?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, multiple layers of mist or haze seem to cover the mountain valleys, creating a depth effect. This visual is common in mountainous regions where atmospheric moisture can settle in the lower elevations and enhance the perception of depth by partially obscing more distant objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the tallest, most prominent peak located near the center of the image, rising above surrounding spires?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although there is a prominent mountain visible near the center, it is dominated by the massive, serpentine dragon figure, which takes precedence as the focal point. The mountain that would conventionally be central is not the tallest structure due to the dragon's height.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there green leafy plants visible in the foreground, especially on the left side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the dragon and mountains, and there is no clear visibility of greenery such as leafy plants in the foreground, especially on the left side where much of the view is blocked by the dragon. The prominent focus on fantasy elements diverts from this detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the sky display a gradient from warm orange-pink near the horizon to cooler blue-gray at the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky indeed displays a gradient. Near the horizon, there is a warm hue that transitions to a cooler blue-gray tone at the top. This gradient can be indicative of sunset or sunrise conditions, where the atmosphere affects how light is dispersed and colors are perceived.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible rough, dark gray rock surfaces on the mountain sides, especially on the left and right edges of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the fantastical nature of the image, rough, dark gray rock surfaces are maintained on the mountain sides, particularly at the edges of the frame. This texture contributes to the overall realistic effect of the landscape against which the dragon is placed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
