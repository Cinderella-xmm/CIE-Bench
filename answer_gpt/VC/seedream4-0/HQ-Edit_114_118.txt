    "Question": "Q1: Does the ship retain exactly three masts, with sails arranged in tiers on each mast?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the ship, it does indeed retain three masts, visible along its length. The sails are arranged in tiers, with multiple layers of sails attached to each mast. This arrangement is consistent with a typical sailing ship design, aiming for efficiency in sail handling and wind catch. This layout is visually consistent with maritime knowledge of historical tall ships.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the ship’s hull shaped with a raised stern and a decorated, upward-curving prow?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the ship contained within a glass dome, with a distinctive raised stern at the rear and an upward-curving prow at the front. This shape is common in historical ships, allowing for better navigation through waves. The decorative aspect of the prow often signifies aesthetic detailing found in shipbuilding.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there multiple sails on each of the three masts, with at least two tiers per mast?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each of the three masts on the ship holds multiple sails, organized in at least two tiers per mast. This tiered structure is a typical design feature in sailing ships, maximizing wind capture and ship propulsion, commonly understood from historical maritime design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there at least five seagulls visible in flight around the ship?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image B, there are several seagulls visible around the ship. Counting them from the visual clues given, one can spot at least five seagulls in flight, suggesting an environment bustling with bird activity, often associated with sea travel and coastal conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the ship oriented such that the bow points toward the left side of the image and is slightly elevated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is depicted with its bow pointing towards the right side of the image, not the left. Therefore, the ship does not adhere to the orientation described in the question. Instead, the bow points to the right side of the frame.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible portholes along the sides of the ship’s hull?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, closer examination of the ship's hull does not reveal any visible portholes along its sides. This absence indicates a model that may focus more on the external hull shape without additional detailing such as portholes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the ship positioned above the surface of the water/resin layer, appearing to float?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is placed within a glass dome on a simulated sea of resin. The visual effect means the ship does appear above the resin waves, giving the impression of it floating on this artificial sea. This is consistent with a diorama or ship-in-bottle effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
