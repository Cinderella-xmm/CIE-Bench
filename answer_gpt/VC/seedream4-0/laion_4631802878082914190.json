    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain exactly six labeled process stages corresponding to the CRISP-DM phases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see characters representing stages that are labeled as Business, Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. However, one of the stages in Image B is labeled as 'Busta Understanding,' which is a likely typographical error of 'Data Understanding.' This actually matches the six stages of the CRISP-DM process. Thus, while slightly different in representation or naming, the intent matches the six stages of CRISP-DM.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the six stages arranged in the correct sequential order: Business Understanding → Data Understanding → Data Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → back to Business Understanding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sequence observed is Business, Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. One label is incorrectly worded as 'Busta Understanding,' but intended as 'Data Understanding.' When corrected, the sequence could fit the original CRISP-DM phases. While there is a semantic error, the physical placement suggests an intention to represent the cyclic nature of the process.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the \"Business Understanding\" and \"Data Understanding\" stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visually, the characters representing 'Business' and the misconstrued 'Busta Understanding' stages are connected, although arrows may not clearly indicate bidirectional interaction as observed. The absence of arrows indicating mutual flow suggests there is no explicit bidirectional connection.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a bidirectional connection (e.g., two-way path or mutual interaction) between the \"Data Preparation\" and \"Modeling\" stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'Preparation' and 'Modeling' stages are connected by directed arrows, indicating a sequential flow. There are no indications of arrows going back from Modeling to Preparation, indicating a lack of bidirectional interaction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a central data source located at the center of the diagram, accessible to all six stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the center of the diagram, there is a crystal surrounded by rail tracks, possibly metaphorical representation of a data repository. It is reachable by paths but it’s more illustrative without literal connectivity lines to stages.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the diagram include a clear return path from the \"Deployment\" stage back to the \"Business Understanding\" stage, completing the cycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows arrows flowing through each phase sequentially with final arrows directed from 'Deployment' leading back toward 'Business Understanding,' illustrating a return path, closing the loop.",
