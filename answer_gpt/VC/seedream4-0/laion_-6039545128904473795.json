      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four rotor assemblies arranged symmetrically around the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a futuristic drone that clearly shows four rotor assemblies, one at each corner of the central body. The symmetrical arrangement of these rotors is a common design feature for quadcopters, which provide balanced lift and stable flight. This is concluded through visual cues from the image and a basic understanding of quadcopter design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there yellow triangular markings present on the top and side surfaces of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the drone does not display any yellow triangular markings. The design is more complex and stylized with sharp, angular features. This observation is based solely on visual examination since there are no yellow sections apparent on the body.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the landing supports shaped like V-forms at each corner of the drone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landing supports in Image B appear to resemble more complex appendages rather than straightforward V-shaped forms. These supports are more stylized and integrated with the futuristic design of the drone, deviating from a simple V-form structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central body feature sharp, angular edges and a polygonal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central body in Image B is designed with sharp, angular edges and a complex polygonal structure, typical of a sci-fi aesthetic. This is apparent from the visible contours and facets that give the drone an aggressive and technology-inspired look.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three small rectangular lights aligned horizontally on the top surface of the central body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any horizontal alignment of three small rectangular lights on the top surface. The central body features angular design elements, but there are no visible lights arranged in such a manner. The analysis is based on direct visual observation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the drone predominantly black with yellow accent markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drone in Image B is predominantly black; however, it does not feature yellow accent markings. Instead, it seems to incorporate different colors like blue in its lighting, consistent with a futuristic theme. The analysis is based on visual inspection of the image where such color accents (yellow) are absent.",
