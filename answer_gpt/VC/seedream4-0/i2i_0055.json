      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features is a simplistic design with a light blue elephant mascot and the words 'First Splash! Ele-Baby'.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'Ele-Baby', the cartoon elephant, is shown holding a phone with its trunk to its face. While the cartoon elephant holds a phone, it is done in a cartoon-style way distinct from a human worker using their hand to hold a phone, indicating a different interpretation of the posture.",
