      "question": "Does the echidna retain its detailed spines and naturalistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the echidna has a more simplified and cartoonish appearance compared to what would be expected of a naturalistic echidna. Its spines are smoothed out and lack the detailed and natural texture typically seen in real echidnas. This more stylized and less realistic depiction indicates that the detailed spines and naturalistic appearance have been altered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a landscape with warm, golden hues and similar lighting suggesting a surreal environment. These visual cues match the warm and golden tones typical of a desert-like or surreal landscape, suggesting that these elements are retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the echidna appears to be positioned close to the girl's feet, with their proximity suggesting a similar position as would be expected in a consistent composition involving a character and animal interaction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays tall, angular formations in the background, which appear block-like and stylized. This indicates that the characteristic elements of the landscape have been maintained, albeit potentially with a more stylized look.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the girl in Image B, with hands on her hips and leaning slightly forward, still conveys a sense of confidence. The overall scene composition with her interacting with the echidna and the surrounding environment is preserved, maintaining the original essence of the interaction.",
