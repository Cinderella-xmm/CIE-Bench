      "question": "Is the vessel positioned in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel, which is an ornate lamp, is positioned toward the right side of the image as it leaves space for the genie formed from smoke. This allows for the decorative aspects and the genie to be part of the composition, indicating that the vessel is not centrally placed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a circular tray directly beneath the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no circular tray visible directly beneath the ornate lamp. Instead, the lamp is placed directly on top of the patterned fabric. The embellishments and jewels around reinforce that there is no tray.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does vapor or smoke originate from the top opening of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, smoke is clearly seen emanating from the spout of the ornate lamp, forming the figure of a genie. This indicative smoke is visually clear and originates from the top opening, fitting the theme of a magical lamp.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vessel is shaped as an ornate lamp with an elongated spout and a bulbous body, not a conical or upward-tapering shape as seen in traditional vessels like tajines. It's composed more of curves and intricate details.",
      "weight": 2,

      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate lamp is indeed placed on a flat fabric surface that is richly decorated with a geometric pattern, covering the visible plane. This patterned fabric serves as a thematic backdrop for the Middle Eastern aesthetic.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small opening at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B emerges from the spout of the lamp, not a small top opening. The vessel's structure includes a spout as expected from an oil lamp design, indicating the opening is not conventionally at the top but to the side.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric beneath the ornate lamp in Image B does exhibit a rich geometric pattern, using bold colors and shapes reminiscent of traditional Middle Eastern designs. This pattern adds to the cultural aesthetic and thematic ambiance.",
