      "question": "Does the left tie retain its diagonal striped pattern in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left object maintains the diagonal striped pattern with vibrant colors similar to a tie. This aligns with the typical design of neckties that feature diagonal stripes. Based on visual confirmation, the stripes are indeed present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right object shows a pattern of evenly spaced white dots on a blue background, resembling a polka dot design commonly seen on neckties. This indicates that the pattern from the original image has been retained.",

      "question": "Are the original colors (red, orange, turquoise, blue for the left tie and blue with white dots for the right tie) retained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left object's stripes are colored similarly to those in Image A: red, orange, turquoise, and blue. The right object shows a blue background with white dots. The vividness and consistency in colors align with the original design seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the items are placed side by side with the striped one on the left and the polka dot one on the right, maintaining the same relative positioning. The objects' new added elements do not change their side-by-side configuration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a realistic surface texture; instead, it showcases a stylized environment with a drawer and intricate ornaments, typical of a more illustrated or fantasy-like setting. The background is smooth and lacks realistic texture.",
