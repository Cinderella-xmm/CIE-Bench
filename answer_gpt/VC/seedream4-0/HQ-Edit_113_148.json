      "question": "Does the transformed sculpture retain a central tall spire flanked by multiple smaller turrets arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal sculpture features a central tall spire with several smaller turrets around it, arranged in a symmetrical manner. This similarity of structure suggests a consistent design theme from the original Image A and reflects architectural symmetry, commonly seen in castles or sculpted works.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there small red flags positioned at the tip of each turret of the crystal sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the crystal sculpture where no distinct red flags are visible. The tips of the turrets only show clear or blue crystal finishes without any noticeable red elements. This is different from Image A, where red flags are present on the sandcastle turrets.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shovel located in the foreground, angled toward the base of the castle, and partially submerged in reflective water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel with a red blade and yellow handle appears prominently in the foreground. However, it is not submerged in reflective water; it rests on a solid surface without any liquid reflection or submersion effect. This contrasts with Image A, where the shovel is partially in reflective water.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gemstones (replacing seashells) grouped in a cluster at the foot of the crystal castle, similar to the original shell arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, gemstones are placed near the base of the crystal castle in a clustered arrangement, akin to how seashells are arranged around the sandcastle in Image A. This grouping by the foot of the structures remains consistent between the two images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the frosted glass slab feature a continuous horizontal wave pattern that mimics the original ocean’s rolling motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frosted glass slab in Image B does include a horizontal wave pattern similar in style to the rolling waves seen in Image A’s ocean. The wave design suggests motion typical of waves, offering a parallel visual narrative in both instances.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located centrally within the crystal sculpture, rising above all other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tallest tower in the centre of the crystal sculpture, rising clearly above the surrounding turrets, maintaining a characteristic layout similar to the sandcastle seen in Image A. This central dominance is a deliberate design choice in both setups.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the shovel retain a red blade and yellow handle, even if rendered in crystal or another material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel maintains its red blade and yellow handle. Not transformed into crystal or another material, these colors directly match those depicted in Image A, demonstrating consistent color retention from the original depiction.",
