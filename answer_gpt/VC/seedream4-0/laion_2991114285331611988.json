    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the plaid pattern (with red, blue, and black intersecting lines) on the left tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plaid pattern with red, blue, and black intersecting lines is clearly visible on the character depicted in the cartoon style. The pattern appears prominently on the figure's clothing, consistent with what is expected in a plaid design. Through visual observation, the plaid design is noticeable in its typical pattern arrangement, implying preservation from any alterations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the green and yellow bear-shaped emblem on the right tie preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emblem on the right tie is distinct but depicted in a cartoon manner. While its design is comic-style, there's no visible green and yellow bear-shaped emblem, and instead, a royal-like crest is visible, which reflects a change or alteration from any original state.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both ties preserved in their original necktie shape (narrow, tapered, diagonal across the chest)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both ties do not maintain the original narrow necktie shape. The plaid tie is exaggeratedly long and positioned comically to cover the entire figure, giving it an unrealistic form, while the emblem tie is not depicted in a traditional necktie way, indicating deviation from a traditional tie shape.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure with the plaid tie on the left side of the image, and the figure with the emblem on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character with the plaid tie occupies the left section, depicted comically large and occupying much of the left space, while the figure associated with the emblem appears on the right holding a camera, suggesting their relative positions are maintained.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a grassy field with visible green vegetation extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed of a grassy field that extends into the distance, maintaining visual consistency with fields typically shown in such cartoon adaptations. This preserves the grassland look as it fills the backdrop.",
