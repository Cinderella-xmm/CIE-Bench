    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image retain the cylindrical, elongated shape of the baseball bats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects resemble baseball bats and maintain their typical cylindrical, elongated shape. This conclusion is drawn from the clear depiction of the rounded top and straight sides in the artwork, which are characteristic of a baseball bat's shape.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black taped handles of the bats still distinctly visible against the wooden shafts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts two objects that have a lighter, wooden shaft with a noticeably darker area at the narrower end, resembling a taped handle. This suggests that the distinct black handles are still visible against the lighter wood of the bats.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the two baseball bats remain parallel to each other in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the two bats appears to be parallel to each other. This can be inferred from their similar orientation and angle relative to each other, consistent with the parallel nature observed in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bats still placed on a grassy surface, indicating an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bats atop a green, textured surface that mimics the appearance of grass, suggesting their placement in an outdoor setting. This is congruent with Image A's depiction, where the bats also rest on grass.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bats maintain their slight angle toward the viewer, preserving perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bats are drawn at an angle where the perspective seems to approach the viewer, consistent with Image A. This is evidenced by the larger apparent size of the bat ends closer to the viewer, a technique often used to convey depth and perspective.",
