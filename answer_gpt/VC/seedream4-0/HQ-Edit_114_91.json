      "question": "Is the anvil’s pointed horn still present and positioned at the same end of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil's pointed horn is still visible and positioned at the right end of the object. This is confirmed by observing the familiar shape and layout of an anvils, where the pointed horn typically extends outward to assist in working metal. The visual cues in Image B, such as the structure and orientation of the horn, align with common knowledge of anvils.",

      "question": "Does the hammer retain a wooden handle connected to its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer no longer has a wooden handle; instead, an owl-like sculpture is present on top of the anvil. The wooden handle previously seen in Image A, attached to the hammer's head, has been replaced by this new object in Image B, indicating a change in the objects present.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hammer resting diagonally across the anvil’s flat surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no hammer present. Instead, a sculpted owl is sitting on the anvil. Thus, the hammer that was resting diagonally across the anvil’s flat surface in Image A has been removed or replaced in Image B, rendering this statement inaccurate.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a multi-paned window with frosted glass visible on the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a multi-paned window with frosted glass, positioned exactly on the left side. The pattern and texture of the glass in Image B are consistent with frosted glass designs, which obscure visibility while allowing light to pass through, as commonly found in workshops or old tool sheds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are multiple metal tools mounted vertically on the greenish-gray wooden wall behind the anvil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents several metal tools, including hammers and wrenches, mounted vertically on the background wall, which has a greenish-gray wooden texture. These kinds of setups are typical in workshops for organizing various tools, and the arrangement seen in Image B is a practical example of this common practice.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are green ivy leaves visible growing over the window frame and wrapping around the base of the anvil and hammer handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, green ivy leaves can be seen growing over the window frame and partially wrapping around the base of the anvil. However, the statement regarding the hammer handle is incorrect, as the hammer is not present in Image B. The visibility and location of the ivy confirm its presence, but only partially as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the anvil sitting on a wooden workbench showing signs of wear and dust accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the anvil placed atop a wooden workbench that illustrates clear signs of wear and dust. The workbench's surface texture and accumulated organic debris indicate neglect and natural aging, consistent with environments where tools have been left unused over time.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible roots intertwining with the organic, stylized owl sculpture, and other natural elements, like debris, scattered across the workbench surface. The presence of these elements suggests an integration of organic themes, lending a more mystical and nature-centric ambiance to the environment depicted.",
