      "question": "Is the key-shaped symbol with swirling arms and central knob present on the leftmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom shelf's leftmost section features a book or panel with elaborate designs. However, this intricate design does not specifically match a classic key shape with swirling arms and a central knob. This shape seems to be primarily located on the center-bottom section where a more prominent key-like pattern is observable. Therefore, analyzing the visual elements, it's determined that the key-shaped symbol is not on the leftmost book.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spiral motif clearly visible on the central book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the central book of the bottom shelf features a complex carved pattern, but it does not prominently display a spiral motif that would be clear and distinct. The carvings are intricate and detailed, but the absence of a distinct spiral shape leads to the conclusion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flowing vine-like pattern present on the rightmost book of the bottom shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rightmost book on the bottom shelf exhibits detailed carvings that resemble vine-like structures with flowing characteristics. This pattern matches common knowledge of vine motifs in design, thus confirming its presence in this described location.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the interlacing Celtic knotwork patterns present on the top panel and vertical side frames of the bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the top panel and vertical frames are composed of Lego blocks, and any pattern they exhibit comes from the arrangement of these blocks, lacking the detail necessary for traditional interlacing Celtic knotwork. Thus, they do not display detailed knotwork typically seen in intricate carved wood found in such a bookshelf.",

      "question": "Are the three large books with detailed carvings positioned side by side on the bottom shelf, from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, there is a clear arrangement of several books on the bottom shelf, but not three large ones distinctly placed side by side with visible detailed carvings throughout. The layout features multiple books, often separated by stacked blocks, not confirming a side-by-side position of only three detailed ones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least four books with visible carved spines distributed across the middle and upper shelves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, throughout the middle and upper levels, several books are characterized by intricate patterns that might mimic carvings; however, given the Lego construction, these lack real carved depth. Thus, it appears there are several visibly detailed spines, some might be counted as having carved appearances when viewed as such.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the books and structural elements rendered in earthy tones such as brown, tan, and muted red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual assessment of Image B, the books and structural elements constructed with Lego are presented in a spectrum of earthy colors, prominently including shades of brown, tan, and muted red. These tones are consistent with a natural, earth-colored theme.",
