      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pencil in Image B is seen very close to or touching the yellow paper, but due to the angle and focus, it is not definitively touching from the visible cues. However, common visual interpretation suggests it is intended to appear to be writing on the paper.",
