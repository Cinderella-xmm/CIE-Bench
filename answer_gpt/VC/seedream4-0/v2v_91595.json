      "question": "Is the \"Nikon\" logo clearly visible on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the camera is partially visible due to the presence of an owl-like mechanical structure. The 'Nikon' logo is often present on the top of Nikon cameras, but in this image, the owl head obstructs a clear view of where the logo would typically be, thus the 'Nikon' logo is not clearly visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"Nikon D800\" text visible on the back label of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the label on the back of the camera body, where the text 'Nikon D800' is prominently visible. This visibility aligns with knowledge that camera labels often display model names for identification.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the battery compartment door open and hinged on the left side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the battery compartment door is open, and by observing the design and position on the camera body, it would naturally be hinged on the left. This is a common hinge design for camera battery compartments and is visually confirmed in this image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange plastic tab visible inside the battery compartment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the battery compartment area features mechanical gear elements rather than a standard battery compartment setup. Therefore, the orange plastic tab, typically used for battery ejection, is not visible due to the presence of the steampunk aesthetic additions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black EN-EL3e battery partially inserted into the battery compartment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a typical battery compartment setup, there are visible mechanical gears. A battery is present, but the visible gears and steampunk elements suggest the 'partially inserted' status might not apply normally, but visually seems plausible here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the camera body retain a matte black finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a camera body covered by a mechanical owl structure with a unique texture and color scheme, including bronze and metallic accents. The owl structure covers part of the commonly matte black surface, so the entire camera does not retain a matte black finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the textured rubber grip visible on the handgrip of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handgrip area of the camera, which typically includes a textured rubber grip for better handling, is visible. The grip texture and material are consistent with those seen in cameras, hence it is visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the silver metallic ring of the lens mount visible and centered on the front of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lens mount area is visible in Image B, and the silver metallic ring, characteristic of camera mounts, remains visible and appears centered as part of the owl structure. This aligns with how lens mounts are typically designed on cameras.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the text \"MADE IN JAPAN\" and the serial number \"6003450\" visible on the back label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back label of the camera body clearly displays both the 'MADE IN JAPAN' text and the serial number '6003450'. This label information is typical for camera models to assist with identification and origin reference.",
      "weight": 2,
