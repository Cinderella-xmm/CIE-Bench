    "Question": "Q1: Is there at least one clock face with Roman numerals visible on the front or side of the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a robotic structure with mechanical features like gears and steam pipes. This structure is reminiscent of steampunk design but does not resemble a traditional clock or tower structure. It lacks any clock faces with Roman numerals. By examining the visual information, there are no clock faces visible on this robot; it's designed more like a complex machine rather than a traditional clock structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there transparent glass panels on the lower section of the clock showing internal mechanical components such as pendulums and weights?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays a mechanical robot with exposed gears rather than a traditional clock with transparent panels. The mechanical components are deliberately external and visible, designed in an ornamental manner with no indication of glass panels housing pendulums or weights as seen in some clock designs. The structure is not a clock, and thus does not possess these features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the base of the structure contain decorative relief carvings featuring circular medallions and floral motifs arranged symmetrically?",
    "explanation": "The robot in Image B, although detailed, is composed of a variety of gears, pipes, and mechanical parts typical of a steampunk style, not directly featuring decorative relief carvings such as circular medallions or floral motifs that are often seen on decorative clock bases. The design focuses more on mechanical complexity rather than artistic carvings.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a sharpened wooden pencil standing vertically to the right of the clock, with its graphite tip pointing upward?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes a prominent sharpened wooden pencil positioned vertically on the right side of the robot or mechanical structure, clearly visible within the frame. This pencil has a distinct graphite tip pointing upward, conforming to the description provided.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background composed of a light-colored surface with a visible grid pattern of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is indeed a light surface with a subtle grid pattern composed of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines. This design provides a technical, schematics-like aesthetic often used in engineering drawings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the structure maintain a tall, rectangular, multi-tiered form with symmetrical columns and a defined top cap?",
    "explanation": "The mechanical robot in Image B does not have a tall, rectangular, multi-tiered form or symmetrical columns with a top cap. Instead, it is constructed to resemble a humanoid machine with limbs and a square central body, emphasizing gears and mechanical elements rather than a structured architectural form.",
    "answer": "No"
