      "question": "Is the elderly man’s long white beard and mustache clearly visible and present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood carving style enhances details of the depicted man's features, including a long white beard and mustache that are prominently sculpted. Comparing this with Image A, where the beard is naturally depicted, confirms that the beard and mustache are indeed clearly visible and present in both images.",

      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed conical straw hat positioned on the man’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sculpted interpretation of a wide-brimmed conical hat, identical in style and positioning to that of Image A. World knowledge tells us that such hats are traditional in many Asian cultures and are used for sun protection. The hat maintains its position on the man's head in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the man seated cross-legged in the center of the boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's pose appears seated, but upon close examination, his legs are not crossed. This is a similar pose to that in Image A, where the man's legs are bent but not crossed. Thus, the seated position is not cross-legged in both images.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the oar held horizontally across the man’s lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the man holding an oar that is positioned horizontally across his lap, similar to Image A. In both, the positioning of the oar is across the lap, serving as a typical way to rest an oar when seated in a boat.",

      "question": "Are the wooden planks of the boat clearly visible and arranged in a linear fashion along the hull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat's wooden planks are clearly carved in a linear fashion that mimics the structure seen in Image A, where the planks also run along the hull in a similar pattern. Such linear arrangements of planks are common in boat construction for structural integrity.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the boat floating on a calm water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpted scene shows water droplets and waves, indicating a water setting, but portrays an artistic version and doesn't highlight a specific calm water surface. Image A displays an actual calm water setting. In the artistic representation, the water isn't explicitly calm but implies a boat on water using artistic elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there misty mountains visible in the background behind the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background appears as a crafted relief of mountains, with layering similar to misty mountains, yet presented in a stylized carved format. While Image A includes a photographic backdrop of misty mountains, Image B represents it in artistic layers. Thus, misty mountains are presented uniquely in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the man wearing a dark brown, loose-fitting robe with visible sleeve folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted wearing a robe resembling wood texture with visible sleeve folds, styled after the dark brown robe in Image A, where natural fabric folds are clear. The artistic style in Image B mirrors the clothing folds seen in Image A, indicative of loose-fitting robes.",
