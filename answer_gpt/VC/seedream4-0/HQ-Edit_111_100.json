      "question": "Is the fan-shaped headdress with radiating elements present on the warrior’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's head features a distinct headdress that visually resembles a fan with radiating segments coming out from the center, which is consistent with common depictions of traditional warrior headdresses or crowns involving fan-like elements. The segmented structure presents an impression of emanating from a central point around the top of the head. Therefore, based on these visual cues and common headdress attributes, the fan-shaped headdress is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warrior in Image B clearly displays a circular emblem situated directly at the center of its chest plate. This circular design is prominently visible and aligns with the traditional placement of central emblems on armor. Therefore, a circular emblem is indeed present at the center of the chest plate.",

      "question": "Is a spear held in the warrior’s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior's right hand is seen holding an object reminiscent of a spear, identifiable by its shaft-like structure and pointed tip, which are typical features of a spear. Thus, it is evident that the warrior is holding a spear in the right hand.",

      "question": "Are the torso and legs covered in layered, scale-like armor pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the warrior’s attire fashioned into sections reminiscent of armor, but it is constructed using block-like formations rather than layered or scale-like pieces. The blocky pattern implies a geometric build akin to LEGO bricks rather than scales. Thus, the torso and legs are not in layered, scale-like armor.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B is positioned on a distinctly white pedestal, and there are two rectangular plaques visibly attached to the front, providing information or descriptions about the statue. Such features are commonly found in exhibition settings for informational purposes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features framed artworks mounted on the side walls of the gallery. These artworks appear to depict landscapes, judged from the visible forms and colors resembling natural scenery, which is a common subject in framed gallery art pieces.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the statue positioned equidistantly from the walls on either side of it, suggesting symmetry and central placement within the gallery space. This arrangement aligns with standard exhibition practices for better viewing space and accommodation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination, the warrior in Image B is not holding any shield-like object in the left hand. The left hand does not visibly contain an object resembling the broad, flat aspects of a shield in typical ancient warrior depiction.",

      "question": "Does the warrior have a broad nose, deep-set eyes, and a stern mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the warrior are not defined beyond the block forms used to portray the object. The absence of specific facial features such as a nose, eyes, or mouth rules out detailed analysis of characteristics like broadness in the nose or depth in the eyes.",
