      "question": "Are the two main mountain peaks still present and positioned side by side as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central subject is a large creature resembling a rocky beast with horns. There are no visible mountain peaks positioned side by side as seen in Image A, where there are two distinct mountain peaks. The landscape setting has been altered drastically with the introduction of this creature, and the recognizable mountain features are absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the summits of both peaks retain patches of snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the colossal rock-like creature, which does not have any patches of snow on it. Image A displays mountain summits with patches of snow despite the overcast sky, which is typical for high elevations. In Image B, there is no visual indication of mountains or snowy summits due to the replacement with the creature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horizontal and vertical rock strata visible on the mountain faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a creature with a rugged surface that somewhat mimics rock strata, but these are not the same as horizontal and vertical rock strata on mountain faces visible in Image A. Image A showcases clear geological formations on the mountainsides, which are typical traits of natural mountain formations, while Image B's edited features do not show mountain strata.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the narrow road visible winding through the lower valley, extending toward the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the landscape base with the large creature, and no winding road is visible in the lower area. Image A clearly showcases a winding road through the valley, leading towards the mountains, but Image B does not retain this particular feature as the focus is on the creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the slopes covered in patches of brownish-orange heather and dry grass, particularly in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses primarily on the creature, and the original landscape features have been altered or omitted. While some natural elements around the creature retain earthy tones, the specific patches of heather and grass seen in Image A's mid-ground are not evident in Image B's altered setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sky uniformly overcast with no direct sunlight, resulting in soft shadows across the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an overcast sky similar to Image A, resulting in similar lighting conditions without direct sunlight. The absence of direct sunlight is evident in the soft shadows in both images. This atmospheric consistency maintains the mood from the original despite the changes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the valleys show smooth, continuous contour lines that follow the natural slope of the land?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's central focus causes alterations to the lower landscape, primarily removing or altering natural contour lines of valleys present in Image A. Image A displays smooth, continuous landscape contours typical of a natural valley view, while Image B lacks these due to the presence of the creature.",
