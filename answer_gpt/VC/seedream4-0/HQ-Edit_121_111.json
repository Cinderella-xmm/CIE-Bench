      "question": "Is the squirrel depicted in an upright stance, supported by its hind legs, with its front paws raised toward its mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is indeed depicted in an upright stance, supported by its hind legs. Its front paws are raised and appear to be clasping a jewel, suggestive of movement towards the mouth but more oriented towards holding the jewel prominently. The overall posture and positioning strongly suggest the squirrel being upright, which aligns with typical behaviors of squirrels when interacting with objects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the squirrel’s facial features, including its dark round eyes, pointed nose, and visible whiskers, clearly present and accurately rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's facial features, such as its large, dark round eyes, pointed nose, and visible whiskers, are clearly and artistically rendered. This attention to detail is evident with an emphasis on creating a fantasy-like appearance, while still retaining recognizable squirrel attributes.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and backward over its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's tail is large, bushy, and curves upward and backward over its body, which is consistent with how a squirrel's tail typically lies when they're in a standing position. The edited image adds a more whimsical and colorful aspect to the tail, giving it a pink hue, but retains the structural characteristics.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a wooden pencil clearly visible in the lower right foreground, similar to Image A, except it is not embedded in grass but situated among the jewels. This continuation of design adds to the artistic setting, providing a hint of the process behind the creation of the artwork.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a paintbrush with a red handle and silver ferrule visible in the upper right corner, which is used to emphasize the artistic context of the image, paralleling Image A's inclusion of similar artistic tools, thus providing a consistent theme.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's front paws are clasping a jewel tightly, with its fingers wrapped around it. This depiction mirrors the common behavior of squirrels holding items they find valuable or interesting, showcasing a sense of interaction and focus on the jewel it is holding.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is not standing on a patch of green grass with visible blades and small soil areas. Instead, it is surrounded by a fantastical and colorful setting with jewels scattered around, which replaces the natural ground setting seen in Image A.",
