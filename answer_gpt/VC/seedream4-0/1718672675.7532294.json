      "question": "Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock face of the cliff is part of a large, mythological figure. The surface of the rocks on this figure does not show distinct horizontal sedimentary layers but looks more like a constructed or carved texture with some runes inscribed in it. This suggests it does not feature sedimentary layers but rather an artistic representation of a giant creature integrated into the cliff.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bright, linear reflection of the sun visible on the water surface extending from the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is visible on the horizon, and there is a bright reflection extending towards the viewer across the water surface, which is typical when the sun is low and casting light on a calm water surface. This linear reflection of the sun is a common phenomenon observed during sunrises or sunsets.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there multiple small boats visible on the water surface in the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface is visible, particularly towards the bottom left of the image. However, there don't appear to be any small boats visible. The focus of this image is more on the large humanoid figure and the natural scenery around it, rather than on any boating activity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are shrubs and small trees growing along the upper edges and crevices of the cliff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large figure integrated into the cliff has small trees and greenery growing on and around it, including along the upper edges and crevices of its constructed body. This vegetation enhances the mythical and natural integration of the figure with its environment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground of the scene is occupied by the large figure rather than natural cliff formations with boulders and grassy patches. The rocks appear to form part of the creature, and the presence of vegetation is more strategically placed to enhance the integration between the natural and unnatural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sun located low on the horizon, emitting a warm golden glow across the sky and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is positioned low on the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow across the sky and reflecting on the water surface. This type of lighting typically occurs during sunrise or sunset, adding a serene and picturesque quality to the landscape scene.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the cliff edge form a steep, continuous drop-off directly into the water below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cliff includes the large humanoid figure integrated into it. The cliff edge appears to be steep, but rather than a continuous natural drop-off into the water, it's more like a constructed drop-off as part of the figure's design. The nature of the cliff drop-off in this context is more artistic rather than naturally continuous.",
