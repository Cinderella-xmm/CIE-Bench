    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the calico pattern of orange, black, and white patches preserved in the same spatial arrangement across the catâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is represented by geometric shapes resembling crystals or glass. The calico pattern is transformed into orange, black, and white sections of these materials, but they do not maintain the same spatial arrangement as a natural calico pattern seen in Image A due to the different structure and properties of these materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes still green and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes appear green and are positioned symmetrically on the face, maintaining the same central alignment as seen in Image A, despite the transformation into crystal-like features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat in an upright seated position with both front paws placed directly in front of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat figure composed of crystalline elements, still depicting an upright seated position with front paws in front of its body, similar to the posture seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pink nose present at the center of the face, surrounded by white fur on the muzzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nose is not pink; instead, it appears as part of the crystal-like structure surrounding the mouth and does not have the distinct pink appearance or white fur as seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cat seated on a vertical wooden block that supports its full weight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat figure is sitting atop a vertical wooden block, similar to Image A. The block visually supports the figure's weight, consistent with the supporting role it has in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the tail curled to the right side and displaying alternating orange and black bands consistent with the body pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail consists of sections with different colors due to the cat's crystalline representation. While it is curled to the right, the bands of orange and black do not match the specific pattern in Image A due to its transformed appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays both ears of the crystalline cat pointed forward and symmetrically placed on top of the head, similar to the positioning in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystalline material does not depict the same white fluffy area as Image A. The area is composed of transparent and colored crystal shapes without the original fur texture.",
