    "Question": "Q1: Is the hot dog represented as an elongated, straight object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, what visually appears like a hot dog is made of LEGO blocks. It retains the traditional elongated, straight shape associated with hot dogs made from food. The LEGO construction mimics this form, maintaining a linear, extended appearance consistent with a typical hot dog shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the hot dog placed horizontally on the wooden base?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the LEGO hot dog is set horizontally atop the wooden board surface. This horizontal placement replicates the conventional way of serving a hot dog, which is typically laid flat.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are both the hot dog and the bottle placed on a flat wooden surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO hot dog is on what appears as a wooden platform or board. The bottle, now replaced by a mosaic vase-like object, is also situated on the same flat wooden table surface, indicating both objects are placed on flat wooden surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the bottle positioned to the left of the hot dog?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the mosaic vase-like object (which replaces the bottle from Image A) positioned on the left side of the LEGO hot dog. The positioning mirrors the layout typically expected if the objects were aligned in that orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the hot dog placed on a raised wooden platform distinct from the main table surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO hot dog is set on a raised wooden platform or base distinct from the main table surface. This distinct platform is visibly raised compared to the surrounding tabletop, suggesting an intentional separate placement for the hot dog structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
