      "question": "Is the coarse, slightly cracked texture of the largest tortilla chip retained, including visible salt crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the largest tortilla chip has been transformed into a cartoon style, losing its realistic details. The texture is smooth and lacks the coarse nature typical of tortilla chips. Additionally, the salt crystals, which were visible in the realistic Image A, are no longer present in the edited, stylized version. This transformation from a realistic to a cartoon image changes the way details like texture and salt are rendered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the golden-brown color of the largest tortilla chip preserved, with natural tonal variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the tortilla chip is a cartoon representation. While a basic yellow color is retained, the nuanced golden-brown color and natural tonal variation observed in the realistic Image A are not. The cartoon artwork tends to use flat, uniform colors, which simplifies the appearance and lacks the depth and variation seen in the original.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chunky, uneven texture of the guacamole mound preserved, showing visible avocado pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole is personified in a cartoonish style and is no longer depicted with a realistic texture. The original chunky texture and visible avocado pieces found in Image A have been replaced with smooth and stylized forms typical of cartoons. This change reflects a shift from a realistic to an artistic representation, which simplifies physical textures.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the green-yellow gradient of the guacamole preserved, showing natural avocado color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon-style Image B, the guacamole is represented in a simplified manner, primarily using a flat green color. This differs from Image A, where natural color variation due to lighting and avocado ripeness showed more realistic green-yellow gradients. The lack of these shades indicates that the natural color variation isn't preserved in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the chip and guacamole rendered with realistic material properties, avoiding glossy or plastic-like finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays both the chip and guacamole in a cartoon style, inherently lacking the realistic material properties like texture and reflectivity found in Image A. The cartoon art style focuses on bold, flat colors and exaggerated features, therefore it does not aim to replicate realistic finishes such as avoiding glossiness. The material properties seen here are intended for artistic expression rather than realism.",
