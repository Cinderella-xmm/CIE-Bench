      "question": "Is the owl perched on a moss-covered branch with visible green moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an owl perched on a branch that appears to be covered with moss, which is evident due to the green texture visible on the surface. Moss typically has a dense, green appearance and often grows on tree branches in forested areas, supporting the observed texture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small green plant with slender leaves growing next to the owl’s left side on the branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, next to the owl's left side on the branch, there is a small green plant with slender leaves visible. This is consistent with typical understory vegetation found in forest habitats.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of dark, out-of-focus green foliage typical of a forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a background featuring dark green, out-of-focus foliage which suggests the setting is within a forest. Forest environments often have dense foliage that appears as blurred greens in out-of-focus areas in photographs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the owl facing the camera directly, yet there is a distinction that the owl's head is slightly tilted, which is a common posture for owls when observing their surroundings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a rough-textured branch with patches of green moss visible, along with discernible crevices. Such textures are characteristic of aged branches in natural habitats like forests.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lighting dim and natural, with subtle highlights on the owl’s feathers and eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears dim and natural, likely mimicking the subdued light typical of forest settings. There are subtle highlights visible on both the owl’s feathers and eyes, enhancing the owl's features under serene lighting conditions.",
