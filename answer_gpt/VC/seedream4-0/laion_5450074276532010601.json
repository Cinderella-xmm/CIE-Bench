      "question": "Is the \"Schildkröt\" brand name visible on the ball box and/or paddle surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a cartoonish representation, a focus on a fictional theme, and the depiction of anthropomorphic paddles with faces, there is no visible inclusion or depiction of brand names, such as 'Schildkröt' that typically would label physical goods in a literal image. By nature, artistic illustrations emphasize fantasy elements rather than brand specifics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the paddles clearly depicted with one red rubber surface and one blue rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays two paddles as animated characters, with exaggerated features like hats and gloves given to the paddles as representation. The paddles' colors are represented in the form of cartoon characters' attire, with the red paddle having a red helmet, and the blue paddle depicted with a blue cap. Therefore, each paddle indeed has a specific color scheme aligning with one red and one blue thematic representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a diamond-shaped logo present on the handle of each paddle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the context of a whimsical and artistic cartoon environment in Image B, the paddles are represented with human-like features and do not display sports equipment details such as logos or branding marks. The focus is more on the adventure theme than the depiction of equipment details like logos.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exactly two paddles included in the set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two animated paddles are depicted, showing playful characters ready for an adventure which metaphorically imply they are the only set deemed necessary for the described journey and narrative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a physical representation of a box but instead uses an adventurous theme with a treasure chest prominently displayed, not portraying the practical aspects like a carrying rope handle seen in typical storage boxes or bags.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is there a horizontal partition inside the box that separates and holds the paddles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B pivots on an imaginative theme with no literal packaging shown like a partitioned box. It depicts a pirate-themed map and treasure chest instead of a tidy partition used to organize paddles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the box have a rectangular shape with a hinged lid that opens upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present a rectangular box, rather it showcases a stylized animated treasure chest, emulating adventure and exploration, differing from a practical rectangular box with hinges.",
