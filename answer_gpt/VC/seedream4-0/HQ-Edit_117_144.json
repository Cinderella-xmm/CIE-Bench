      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted with a full white beard and white hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is illustrated with hair that appears entirely white. However, there is no indication of a beard, suggesting he is clean-shaven. Common representations of elderly figures often include white hair due to the natural aging process, which is consistent with the hair depicted here. As the visual cues do not show a beard, the conclusion is that he does not have one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the man standing upright with his right hand holding an object and his left hand in his coat pocket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is indeed standing upright. His right hand is seen holding a cane-like object, while his left hand is inserted in his coat pocket, which is a common pose for someone using a walking aid for balance or support and simultaneously maintaining a casual posture with the other hand.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the man wear a long overcoat over a sweater vest, shirt, tie, and trousers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is dressed formally, wearing a long overcoat over what appears to be layers including a sweater vest, a shirt underneath, a visible tie, and trousers. Such layers are frequently worn for warmth or style in cooler weather, aligning with the clothing pattern depicted in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there an oval-shaped reflective pool directly behind the man?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the man standing on a cobblestone path without any pool visible directly behind him. The setting lacks any reflective body of water present near the manâ€™s position, indicating no pool behind him or nearby in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the man standing on a cobblestone path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment particularly where the man stands is paved with cobblestones. The texture and pattern typical of cobblestones are visually distinct and conform to the style depicted under and around the person's feet, confirming the setting as a cobblestone path.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the man positioned at the edge of the pool, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, there's no pool present or visible at any proximity to the man, and thus he can't be positioned at the edge of an imaginary pool. He is standing on a cobblestone pathway facing the viewer, but not near any water body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the man holding an object in his right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the man's right hand plainly grasps a cane, a common accessory for stability or an aesthetic addition for elderly or distinguished figures. The presence of this item is unmistakable, conforming to the query.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the ground around the pool made of stone or cobblestone material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit a pool to refer to any ground around such a feature. The entire setting observed is cobblestone, establishing that there's no pool adjacent at all; hence, the ground description solely applies to the cobblestone path on which the man stands.",
