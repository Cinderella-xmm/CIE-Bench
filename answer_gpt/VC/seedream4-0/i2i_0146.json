        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is represented as a toy-like or animated character.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the zebra's ears are depicted as being upright, which is consistent with the typical position of a zebra's ears. This detail is retained even in the animated or toy-style version of the zebra.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized version of a zebra, but it includes a representation of a mane, which is an important anatomical feature of real zebras. Even though the depiction is cartoonish, the mane is present, characterized by a row of upright hair running along the neck.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in the edited image (Image B) has a short tail that ends in a rounded, black tip, which resembles a tuft. This keeps with the general anatomical feature where zebras have tails that end in tufts of hair.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra, despite being a stylized version resembling a toy or cartoon, is shown in a standing posture over a grassy surface. This is evident by the orientation of its legs and body, which follow typical standing features.",
