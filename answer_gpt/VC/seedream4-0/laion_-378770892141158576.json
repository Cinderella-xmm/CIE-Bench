        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is illustrated with short dark hair. This conclusion is drawn from visual cues such as the hair color and style which appear dark in tone and are depicted as short above the collar.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the person sitting on a rock at the edge of a lake with visible grass around, indicating a grassy shoreline. This conclusion is based on visual elements such as the rock, body of water, and surrounding greenery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations suggest a scenic view of a lake surrounded by mountains, but the exact reflection of mountains on the lake's surface is not visually detailed in the artistic representation. Thus, without explicit reflection detail, world knowledge implies it's less likely to be accurately depicted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene includes rocks where the person is seated along the lake's edge, indicating that rocks are present along the shoreline. This conclusion is made from visual cues of the person sitting on natural rock formations near the water.",

      ],
