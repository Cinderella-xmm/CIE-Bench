    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible ice cubes in the glass, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clay glass contains block-like shapes that represent ice cubes. Although they are stylized and not made of ice, their cubical form and placement inside the clay glass indicate they are meant to depict ice cubes, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a metallic straw inserted into the cocktail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, within the clay drink, there is a cylindrical clay shape that simulates a straw, but it is made of the same material as the rest of the objects and does not have the visual cues of a metallic sheen or texture that a metallic straw would have. Therefore, the clay representation doesn't indicate a metallic straw.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the surface beneath the cocktail retain a polished wooden texture?",
    "explanation": "The surface under the clay glass in Image B is rendered in clay, lacking a polished texture. While it mimics the layout of a wooden surface, it doesn't have the refined detail or gloss that would indicate a polished wooden texture within the clay context.",
    "answer": "No"
