      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black and white stripe pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is clearly visible with its distinctive black and white stripe pattern that is characteristic of zebras. The pattern shows clearly defined stripes running vertically along the length of its body and down its legs, which is a common feature used to identify zebras. There is no indication in the image that the stripes have been altered or removed.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's body structure, including its legs and torso, intact?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra appears to have a complete and intact body structure. The torso is whole and retains its characteristic shape, and the legs appear to be fully formed and structurally normal, supporting the zebra's weight as it stands. The zebra's posture and proportions suggest it has not been altered in any noticeable way.",

      "question": "Is the watering hole still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The lower portion of Image B displays a body of water that appears to be a small watering hole. The zebra is oriented towards this water source, and a part of the water's edge is visible, indicating its presence in the image. This evidence supports the conclusion that the watering hole is still present.",

      "question": "Are the surrounding rocks and dry earth background still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is set in a dry, rocky environment. Large rocks form a pile on the right side of the image, corresponding to a natural landscape. The earth is dry, similar to a savannah or desert background, which is not uncommon in the habitats zebras are found. These elements of the setting have been preserved across the image.",

      "question": "Does the zebra's tail retain its natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's tail is visible and appears to retain its natural shape and position. The tail is hanging down, slightly swaying as the zebra walks, which is typical behavior for zebras and consistent with its natural anatomy. There is no indication of any alteration to its shape or position.",
