    {

      "question": "Are the cheetahs still depicted in their original seated and standing postures on the earthen mound?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are depicted as steampunk-inspired figures with mechanical parts, but their postures are maintained as in the original image. The cheetah at the front is seated, and the cheetah behind is standing. This suggests the editor retained their original postures while creatively altering their appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the earthen mound still present beneath the cheetahs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the steampunk cheetahs positioned on an earthen mound, similar to Image A. There is no alteration concerning the mound's presence, indicating that this part of the setting was retained in both images.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cheetahs retain their black-ringed tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' tails are still visible. Despite being creatively altered with mechanical elements, the tails still feature the recognizable black-ringed pattern typical of cheetahs. This suggests the editor kept this characteristic detail intact even as they transformed the rest of their appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background still feature a savanna landscape with greenery and a horizon line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has undergone significant changes, depicting a steampunk-style industrial structure under a vivid sky, rather than the simple savanna landscape with greenery and a horizon seen in Image A. This indicates a major alteration in the background setting.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the relative positioning of the cheetahs (one seated in front, the other standing behind) maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the relative positioning of the cheetahs is consistent, with one cheetah seated in front of the earthen mound and the other standing slightly behind and to the side. The editor preserved their positions in the change from biological to mechanical renditions.",
