      "question": "Are the cookies still golden-yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies appear to be golden-yellow. This conclusion is based on visual cues where the cookies have a warm, yellow hue typical of baked goods like sugar cookies. Common sense indicates that the base color of cookies often looks like this due to the baking process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red jam filling in the center of each cookie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies have been transformed into cute characters with faces and limbs, and there is no visual indication of a red jam filling in the center any longer. My conclusion is based on the absence of red spots which typically indicate jam fillings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mug white with black speckles and a handle on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug is indeed white with black speckles, and it has a handle oriented towards the right from the viewer’s perspective. This observation stems from the color contrast between the mug and its surroundings, along with the visible handle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the plate pink with a speckled texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a visible plate under the mug, as the mug is placed on a cloth with a floral pattern, which differs from Image A where a pink speckled plate is used. This conclusion is drawn from visual analysis where no plate can be seen.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are some cookies inside the mug and others arranged on the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while some cookies are inside the mug, others are not on a plate but rather placed on a floral napkin with a miniature table setting. This differs from Image A where a plate is used, showcasing a shift in arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both the mug and the plate have a speckled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug has a speckled surface, but there is no plate visible. Instead, the mug is placed on a floral cloth, which indicates that we cannot attribute a speckled surface to the plate as it doesn’t appear in this image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the mug smaller than the plate and positioned centrally on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no plate visible beneath the mug; instead, the mug is placed on a floral patterned cloth. Consequently, the spatial relationship between the mug and a plate cannot be assessed in this image context.",
