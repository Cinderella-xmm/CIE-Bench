      "question": "Is the Nikon branding visible and legible in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Nikon branding is still visible on the camera body right above the lens. The style and placement closely match what one would expect from a camera using visual cues and knowledge of Nikon cameras. The branding choice maintains visibility despite the steampunk aesthetic framing it with gears and pipes. The word 'Nikon' is clear and readable despite the modified design elements surrounding it.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lens positioned centrally on the camera body in the steampunk illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, it's noted that the lens is placed in a centered position on the camera body. This placement aligns with common camera design principles where the lens is central for optimal photography. The steampunk rendition features decorations surrounding the lens, but it remains in the middle as expected in camera design.",

      "question": "Is the tripod still visibly connected to the camera through a central mount?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a clear representation of the camera being connected to the tripod through a central mount. This connection remains consistent with camera setup knowledge where the tripod interfaces through the base of the camera allowing support. Despite the embellishment with steampunk elements like gears and pipes, the fundamental connection between the camera and tripod is maintained as in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the relative proportions of the camera body, lens, and tripod maintained in the steampunk rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B exhibits a consistency in scale relative to image A: the camera body and lens maintain their proportional relationship, and the tripod supports the camera adequately albeit superficially decorated with steampunk elements like gears and bronze coloring. Comparing with the proportions in Image A, the proportions and relationships between components appear preserved despite stylistic changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the illustration retain a clear depiction of metallic textures on the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the camera and tripod with an emphasis on metallic textures and steampunk decoration, such as brass and bronze coloring, rivets, and gears. These texture choices tie into expectations consistent with knowledge of steampunk designs being metallic, mechanical, and vintage styled. The clarity and detail of such metallic textures are evident in the illustration, enhancing the steampunk theme.",
