      "question": "Does the image retain the metallic texture and finish of the bearings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bearings display a shiny, reflective surface indicative of metal, similar to what is commonly seen in real life with metal objects. The surface of the bearings in Image B seems smooth and polished, mirroring the typical appearance of metal bearings. This observation aligns with the general knowledge that metal bearings often have a gleaming finish to minimize friction and wear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shape and structural details (rings, grooves) of the bearings accurately represented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bearings feature multiple concentric rings and visible grooves that are characteristic of mechanical bearings. These are critical features that enable the bearings to rotate. Recognizing these structural details indicates that the shapes and intricate mechanical design are accurately portrayed, similar to actual mechanical bearings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bearings maintain their relative positions and orientations as shown in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image A and Image B, the positioning and arrangement of the bearings remain consistent. The bearings are placed in a similar formation, with one bearing lying separately while others are arranged inside a case. This consistency indicates that their relative positions and orientations have been maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, there is no visible text as indicated in the question. Image B seems to solely display the bearings and the case without any text overlay or similar graphical elements such as a chalkboard.",

      "question": "Does the background remain clean and uncluttered, focusing attention on the bearings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is plain, primarily white, which offers a sharp contrast to the dark bearings and emphasizes their presence. This uncluttered background helps maintain visual focus on the bearings themselves, which is a typical compositional technique to direct viewer attention to the main subject.",
