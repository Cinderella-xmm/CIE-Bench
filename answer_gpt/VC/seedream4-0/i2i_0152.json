      "question": "Is the steaming cup of coffee present in the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steaming cup of coffee is placed prominently in the foreground. It is positioned slightly to the right of the center, but it is the main focus and the most visually significant object in the image, which may lead to an impression of it being central. The coffee cup and saucer are clearly visible and dominate the composition.",

      "question": "Does the table retain its wooden texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table is shown with a wooden texture, characterized by visible grains and a natural brown color typical of wooden surfaces. The lighting accentuates this texture with highlights and shadows that are consistent with the appearance of wood grain.",

      "question": "Are kitchen cabinets and kitchen utensils visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features elements that resemble kitchen cabinets and utensils. There are visible shapes and outlines suggestive of cabinets with doors, and kitchen utensils can be vaguely discerned, albeit slightly out of focus due to the depth of field, which is typical for compositions emphasizing a foreground subject like the coffee cup.",

      "question": "Has the natural lighting streaming from the left side been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, natural light can be observed coming from the left side, as evidenced by the way shadows and highlights are cast on the table and cup. This indicates that the source of light, possibly a window, is on the left side, providing illumination consistent with the scene's atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear presence of steam rising from the coffee cup. The steam is visually depicted as a translucent and wispy cloud coming from the top of the cup, suggesting that the coffee is hot and freshly made.",
