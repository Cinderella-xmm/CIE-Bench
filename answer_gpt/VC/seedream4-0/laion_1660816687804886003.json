      "question": "Is the circular logo featuring a navy blue \"C\" shape with a red semicircle at the top present on the front of the energy drink can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the object being analyzed is the energy drink can. The visual cue to focus on is the circular logo on the side, which could typically signify branding. Upon examination, the logo with a navy blue 'C' shape and a red semicircle, recognized as the Champion brand logo, is indeed present on the side, similar to where such branding would appear on a shoe. Image A can now be examined to ensure alignment with the original shoe, confirming the same logo exists. Therefore, this logo's presence is consistent on both the shoe and the can.",

      "question": "Does the energy drink can feature the navy blue mesh texture across its main body surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the area covering the energy drink can. The navy blue mesh texture is visible, resembling common fabric patterns like those used in athletic shoes for breathability and design aesthetics. Comparing this to Image A, which displays the original shoe featuring this mesh texture prominently across its main body surface, both objects exhibit similar texture characteristics.",

      "question": "Are the navy blue laces depicted as raised embossed ridges wrapping around the middle section of the can in their original crisscross pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the middle section of the can where navy blue laces are visible. These laces appear as raised embossed ridges, maintaining the original crisscross pattern as seen in typical shoe lacing designs. Checking Image A, the original image of the shoe, confirms this pattern accurately represents the shoeâ€™s lace design. The consistency in pattern and style between both images suggests that the depiction of the laces in Image B matches the shoe's lacing pattern.",

      "question": "Are three navy blue stripes arranged horizontally across the lower portion of the can, matching the original shoe's stripe layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the can displays navy blue stripes arranged horizontally. This arrangement is akin to iconic branding stripes found in athletic shoes, possibly reflecting Adidas's brand design traits. Confirming with Image A, the lower part of the shoe aligns with these horizontal stripes, maintaining brand identity consistency across both objects.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" displayed in red lettering on the upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the upper portion of the energy drink can where the text 'Kickstart' is clearly visible in bold red lettering. This placement and typography typically signify product names or slogans meant to catch attention. Comparing this aspect to Image A, where no such lettering exists on the shoe, it's evident that 'Kickstart' is newly added to the edited image to alter branding identity, differing from the original shoe.",
