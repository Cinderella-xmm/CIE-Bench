    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two small human figures visible beneath the tree in the same relative position as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two human figures are positioned in the field under the tree, slightly to the left of the tree base. Comparing this with Image A, the figures in the original are also located under the tree but are closer together and almost directly beneath the tree's trunk. This indicates that their relative position in relation to the tree has shifted slightly in Image B, being more to the left.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the horizon line present and continuous across the entire width of the image, separating the field from the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line is clearly visible and acts as a boundary between the field and sky, maintaining continuity across the width of the image, just as in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky retain the gradient transition from pale blue near the horizon to deeper teal at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a sky that moves from a pale blue near the horizon to a deeper teal at the top, similar to a common atmospheric gradient seen in clear weather conditions. This gradient is consistent with the original Image A, where a similar transition is visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the foreground composed of tall grass with a mix of green and golden-yellow hues, extending toward the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground is filled with tall grass that combines green and golden-yellow shades extending towards the tree. This composition is consistent with the original Image A, where the grass displays similar colors and extends towards the tree.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tree located in the center-right portion of the image, dominating the right half of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is centrally located, not shifted to the right of the image. It is a prominent feature but does not dominate only the right half, as might be expected if positioned to the center-right. Image A also features a centrally positioned tree.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a subtle shadow cast beneath the tree, indicating directional lighting from the upper left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting doesn't create a clearly defined shadow beneath the tree, possibly due to the fantastical alterations and illumination at the base of the tree. Unlike Image A, where natural lighting casts a shadow under the tree, the light source and shadow interplay in Image B are influenced by the ethereal glow emitted from the tree, obscuring any subtle natural shadow.",
