      "question": "Is there a handheld fan with a circular blade structure being held in the manâ€™s right hand, directed toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is indeed holding a handheld fan with a circular blade structure in his right hand, which is positioned in front of him and directed toward the cake. This matches the typical appearance of handheld fans that are used to create airflow in a specific direction. The fan's design and the way it is held clearly indicate its purpose to direct airflow toward the cake.",

      "question": "Are there exactly seven candles on the cake, with visible flames and smoke rising from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake features seven lit candles. The flames are clearly visible with a bright appearance, which is consistent with what candles look like when they are burning. However, in contrast to Image A, there is no visible smoke rising from the candles in Image B. Hence, while there are seven candles with flames, there is no smoke in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, despite the presence of flames on the candles, there is no visible smoke rising from them, unlike what one would expect when candles are burning. This is different from Image A, where smoke is visible. Therefore, in Image B, smoke is not depicted even with the lit candles.",

      "question": "Is the man leaning forward with his mouth puckered as if blowing air toward the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's posture is more upright and there is no visible indication, such as puckered lips, suggesting that he is leaning forward or attempting to blow air toward the cake. Instead, the focus is on the handheld fan directing airflow toward the cake. This differs from the typical signs associated with a blowing motion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is indeed situated on a white plate. This plate is resting on a surface that appears to have a wooden texture, indicated by the typical brown color and grain patterns seen on wood. This matches the common setup for placing cakes during celebrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handheld fan is held by the man and positioned in such a way that it is directed towards the cake. The angle and orientation suggest that the airflow from the fan would be directed towards the candles on the cake, as would be the intention when trying to blow out candles without using one's breath.",
