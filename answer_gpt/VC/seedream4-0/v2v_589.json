      "question": "Does the image retain the vibrant lime-green color for the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are depicted with a vibrant lime-green color. This color matches the color theme seen in the soccer cleat in Image A, which is also a bright lime-green. This consistent use of color contributes to the cohesive aesthetic within the set of objects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls retain the textured surface resembling the cleat's material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B appear smooth with no visible texture indicating a rough surface or resemblance to cleat material. In comparison, the cleat from Image A has an implied textured surface common to sports footwear to enhance grip and control. Therefore, the dolls do not retain this specific surface texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls incorporate the fuzzy texture and white seam of the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B do not feature any fuzzy texture or white seams. The tennis ball in Image A has a distinct fuzzy surface and a noticeable white seam, typical of tennis balls for better grip and visibility. These attributes are absent in the nesting dolls, indicating they do not incorporate these tennis ball features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls reflect the elongated shape of the soccer cleat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls possess the classic rounded and cylindrical shape inherent to nesting dolls, without any elongation characteristics. The soccer cleat in Image A is elongated to cradle the foot during sports activities, but this shape does not transfer to the design of the nesting dolls.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls incorporate the rounded shape of the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B exhibit a rounded shape, particularly at the top, which is a common feature of nesting dolls. This shape could be loosely associated with the rounded shape of the tennis ball in Image A, which is also a rounded 3D object. While the dolls aren't perfectly spherical like the tennis ball, they do incorporate a rounded aspect common in both objects.",
