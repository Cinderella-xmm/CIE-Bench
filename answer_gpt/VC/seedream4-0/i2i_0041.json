      "question": "Do the sheep retain their interaction posture (one feeding the others) in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters resemble sheep but are anthropomorphized, with added scarves and earmuffs, instead of having realistic animal features. They stand facing the railing, mimicking a feeding posture similar to Image A, where the original sheep also face the railing appearing to be fed. This shows a retention of the interaction posture in the context of animated characters.",

      "question": "Is the green metal railing still placed in the same relative position near the sheep in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green metal railing is visible in front of the chibi sheep characters, consistent with its position in Image A where the real sheep are interacting with it. Both images show it close to the sheep figures, maintaining its relative placement in the scene.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the snowy ground and background indicative of a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy ground and winter-like scenery are depicted with white ground and snow-covered trees in the background, which closely mimic the winter setting shown in Image A with real snow and bare trees. This retains the winter aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, wooden fences are clearly illustrated in the background, matching the arrangement and position seen in Image A, where the real scene includes fences amidst the snow. This indicates the retention of these elements in the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters have rounded, fluffy shapes, with earmuffs suggesting ears, similar to sheep. This artistic and stylized depiction closely maintains the essence of sheep, unlike Image A where the animals are realistic sheep.",
