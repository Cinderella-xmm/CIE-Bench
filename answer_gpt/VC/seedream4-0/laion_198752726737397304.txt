    "Question": "Q1: Is the rosette badge with the text 'GRAND CHAMPION' and black-and-white ribbon design still present on the chest of the third individual?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the third individual is seen wearing a costume with floral patterns and a cape. Despite this transformation, the rosette badge is clearly visible on the individual's chest, with the text 'GRAND CHAMPION' and a black-and-white design, which stands out against the bright costume. Comparing this with Image A, the rosette is also present on the same individual, confirming that it has been intentionally retained in the edited image.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the wristwatch visible on the left wrist of the third individual?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the costume and accessories of the third individual. The individual's costume is elaborate with long sleeves, and there is no wristwatch visible on the left wrist.

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a ring visible on the ring finger of the left hand of the third individual?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the third individual's left hand is visible, but the floral costume and gloves cover any original details such as rings. In Image A, a ring is clearly seen on the ring finger of the third individual. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the ring is obscured or not included in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the tattoo visible on the forearm of the third individual?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases the third individual wearing a full-body costume with long sleeves and gloves, which cover the arms entirely. This would obscure any tattoos that were originally visible. In Image A, the tattoo on the forearm of the third individual is distinctly visible. Therefore, in Image B, the tattoo is not visible due to the costume.",

    "Question": "Q6: Are the five individuals positioned in the same left-to-right order as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals are wearing distinctive costumes but maintain the same arrangement as in Image A.
