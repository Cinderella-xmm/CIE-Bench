    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the zebras' bodies covered in distinct black and white stripes that follow the natural pattern seen in the original image, including variations in thickness and alignment across the torso, legs, and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are depicted with a simplified cartoonish style rather than realistic natural patterns. The stripes are uniform, without the variations typically seen in real zebras, as evident from Image A. The cartoon stripes lack complexity, reflecting a stylized version rather than a natural pattern with thickness and alignment variations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is each zebra depicted with its head lowered toward the ground in a natural grazing pose, with legs positioned to support this stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras have their heads lowered, mimicking a grazing pose, consistent with the natural movement seen in Image A. Although their style is cartoonish, the posture resembles the typical grazing position with legs supporting this activity, akin to the original image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the horizontal wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts clearly visible across the mid-ground of the image, separating the field from the treeline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a horizontal wire fence with evenly spaced wooden posts, visible across the mid-ground, similar to the realistic depiction in Image A. This barrier serves to separate the field from the surrounding treeline, maintaining visual continuity in the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ground covered in green grass with visible patches of bare soil and small green shrubs scattered throughout the field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a field covered in green grass in a consistent, smooth manner typical of a cartoon style and lacks visible patches of bare soil that gives a more uniform appearance compared to Image A, which has realistic variations like patches of bare soil and scattered shrubs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a continuous line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, with a clear light blue sky above the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a continuous line of green trees and bushes behind the fence, consistent with the natural backdrop seen in Image A. The light blue sky is also present above the horizon, providing a coherent background for both images.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the zebras have short, upright manes composed of alternating black and white stripes, consistent with their body patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras have manes represented by singularly styled, non-striped sections, differing from the realistic detailed stripes that extend through the manes seen in Image A. The cartoonish representation simplifies the mane into a single color block without alternating striping, diverging from natural continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the zebraâ€™s hooves dark in color and positioned on the ground in a way that supports their grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays zebras with dark-colored hooves, positioned to support a grazing posture. This is consistent with the anatomical support function seen in Image A, where real zebras use their hooves for balance while grazing.",
