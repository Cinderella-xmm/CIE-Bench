        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown wearing a red ski outfit in both panels. The color red is clearly visible on the jacket and pants, which is typically used for ski attire. Given the bright and distinct appearance of the outfit, it is reasonable to conclude that the character is indeed wearing a red ski outfit.",

      "question": "Is the character wearing a black helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with a helmet on their head in both panels. The helmet is drawn in dark tones which suggest the color black, particularly visible against the snow and red outfit. Helmets are common safety gear for skiing, and the visual cues support that the helmet is indeed black.",

      "question": "Are skis and poles present in both panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first panel shows the character using skis and holding poles while skiing down the mountain. In the second panel, the character is depicted after a fall, still holding the poles and with the skis clearly attached to the boots. The presence of skis and poles in both panels is evident from the visual information.",

      "question": "Is there a snowy mountain backdrop with scattered rocks in both panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a snowy mountain backdrop in both panels. The background is filled with snow, and rocks are placed sporadically across the landscape, contributing to the alpine environment. This is consistent in both panels, providing a setting that resembles a typical skiing location with natural rocky elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels of Image B, the character is depicted with a backpack visible on their back. The backpack is shaded in a dark color, suggesting that it is black. Carrying a backpack while skiing is practical for storing essential gear and supplies, further supporting the inference of the black color.",
