    "Question": "Q1: Is the skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes located on the rear fender of the motorcycle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle model is constructed with building blocks, resembling a LEGO set, and features no visible skull face on the rear fender. The design is made of basic colored blocks and does not include detailed graphics like a skull on any part of the motorcycle. With this observation, the absence of a skull face on the rear fender is confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a skull face with grinning teeth and hollow eyes positioned on the front headlight cowl?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building block motorcycle lacks detailed graphics, such as a skull face, on any specific part, including the front headlight cowl. The blocks used are basic and do not replicate intricate designs like a skull. This lack of depiction confirms that there is no skull face on the front headlight cowl.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the blue angular stripes present along the fuel tank, side panels, and front fairing in the same geometric configuration as in the original?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, due to the limitations of the building block model, the angular stripe design present in Image A's motorcycle cannot be precisely replicated. The image of the block motorcycle only uses blocks to suggest a similar color pattern but lacks the same geometric angular precision and detail. Thus, they are not in the same configuration as in the original.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3” decal visible on the lower side panel near the foot peg area?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a building block motorcycle model that includes decals with text. Among these, recognizable decals such as “V-SDI” and “VFORCE3” are visible on the lower side panel near the foot peg area. This confirms that the decals are present on the block model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the motorcycle shown in a side profile view facing toward the right side of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle model is indeed shown in profile, facing the right side of the image. This is consistent with a typical side profile view that allows visibility of details on one side of the motorcycle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the exhaust pipe located beneath the seat and curving downward toward the rear wheel?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates a building block model of a motorcycle where the exhaust pipe is a separate piece attached beneath the body but does not exhibit the characteristic curve towards the rear wheel. Instead, it takes a straight, simplified path due to the constraints of the block design. Therefore, the description does not match.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the seat have a smooth, slightly curved surface with a raised backrest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle model consists of block pieces that do not incorporate smooth curves due to the nature of the medium. The seat is composed of flat blocks, which cannot replicate the smooth, slightly curved surface or raised backrest seen in traditional motorcycle seats. Therefore, the description does not apply to the block model.",
    "answer": "No"
