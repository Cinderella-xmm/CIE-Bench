        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Ultraman is depicted as a chibi-style figure within a snow globe. The suit is indeed rendered in red and silver, which are the signature colors of Ultraman. The chibi representation retains these colors, demonstrating a stylized version rather than a full-size depiction. The proportions are more exaggerated and cutesy, typical of chibi art styles, but the colors remain consistent with the classic Ultraman suit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows Ultraman as a chibi figure inside a snow globe. The Ultraman character has a helmet with prominent yellow oval eyes, consistent with traditional Ultraman design. Additionally, there is a blue gem on the chest area, which is a typical feature of Ultraman's suit design. These details are preserved even in the chibi form, maintaining the recognizable features of the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the snow globe scene of Image B, a monster is also present alongside Ultraman. This creature has bat-like features, such as large, pointed ears resembling bat wings, and it displays a wide-open mouth showing visible fangs. These characteristics are in line with typical monster designs that draw inspiration from bat-like creatures, making it consistent within this depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the snow globe is designed to resemble ruins or a rocky landscape. Scattered on the base are various metallic pieces, suggesting debris or remnants of a structure. This adds to the scene's environment, giving the impression of a post-battle or ancient setting, which is thematically consistent with monster confrontations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible artist signature such as 'Arthur Adams 10-17-2020.' The focus of this image is on the stylized characters and the thematic elements within the snow globe rather than any artist signature. Typically, artist signatures are more common in drawn or illustrative contexts rather than manufactured objects like a snow globe.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the snow globe in Image B, the words 'MARVEL,' 'ULTRAMAN,' and 'THE TRIALS OF ULTRAMAN' are present and visible. These elements are part of the branding and titling for the Ultraman theme, prominently featured to attract attention and provide context for the characters depicted in the globe.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Ultraman, as a chibi figure, is not depicted in a forward-leaping pose with an arm extended. Instead, the figure stands in a static pose suitable for display within a snow globe. This differs from more dynamic action scenes typically shown in comic book illustrations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B, being a snow globe, does not display any greenish-yellow textures with organic, ribbed patterns. Instead, the scenery is designed to resemble a space or cosmic background, fitting with the Ultraman and monster characters. The intentional aesthetic is more about creating a magical, celestial vibe rather than focusing on organic or natural textures.",
