      "question": "Is the cheetah face graphic present on the right sleeve of the subject's top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a carved figure wearing a garment with patterns resembling a cheetah on its sleeves. Based on the visual cues, similar to clothing patterns that depict specific animal prints, the cheetah face graphic remains consistently styled along the sleeve.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves are clearly visible in gold color, which aligns with shiny brass or metallic finishes often used for decorative purposes. The visible laces on both gloves are seen and recognizable as they contrast against the carved surface with typical lace detailing in the carvings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sleeves in Image B maintain the leopard print design, identified by the spotted texture commonly associated with such animal skins. However, the headscarf does not visually present a leopard print, as it appears as a textured Egyptian-style headdress without the characteristic spotted pattern.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the subject with a head covering that is distinctly Egyptian-style with horizontal lines, commonly found in ancient cultures and lacks any leopard print pattern. It does not show a red and black color scheme, affirming no leopard print is seen compared to the garment sleeves.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features carved palm fronds that bear a green color indicating vegetation. Such details are common in relief sculptures to depict natural settings consistent with ancient depictions of landscape elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the framing of the image shows carved rectangular and geometric elements typical of border designs in relief sculptures and is not white, as the stone material gives it a natural off-white hue.",
