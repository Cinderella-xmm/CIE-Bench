      "question": "Does the atomic design retain the three intersecting elliptical orbits with a central nucleus and three electron positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the atomic design depicted has three intersecting elliptical orbits surrounding a central nucleus position, complemented by the presence of three cookie decorations symbolizing electrons. The layout maintains the typical structure of an atomic model based on these visual elements. Combined with common knowledge of atomic models, these features confirm the retention of the atomic design with the core structure intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the white plastic cookie cutter retaining its original atomic-shaped outline with three elliptical loops and a central nucleus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white plastic cookie cutter exhibits an atomic-shaped structure characterized by three elliptical loops and a central nucleus. This matches the general concept of atomic models where orbits surround the nucleus, indicating the cookie cutter's design remains consistent with this model. Visual cues confirm that its form is unchanged in this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cookie cutter positioned to the left of the atomic imprint, with a partial edge overlap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the cookie cutter is located to the left of the cookie's atomic imprint, displaying a partial overlap along the edge. This arrangement can be discerned from the way the cutter's ellipse intersects slightly with the dough, indicating part of their positioning and interaction. Such configurations are typical when cutters are placed beside imprints for design demonstrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the atomic imprint in the dough have clean, continuous edges without breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the atomic imprint in the dough with precise and smooth edges, devoid of breaks or distortions. This is observable from its clear lines that denote the elliptical orbits and central structure. This is consistent with the imprint being created using the cookie cutter whereby impressions are generally clean and continuous when accurately pressed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small central hole in the nucleus area of the atomic imprint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the atomic imprint in Image B, there is a discernible small hole located centrally within the nucleus area. This detail is consistent with visual characteristics where the nucleus may feature an indent or hole as part of the imprinted design, being a standard result when cookie designs include such specialized mold features.",
