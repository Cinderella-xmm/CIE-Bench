      "question": "Does the teddy bear still wear a white helmet and a blue cape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear is still shown with a white helmet and a blue cape, similar to the objects seen in Image A. The white helmet is visually distinct due to its color and shape, and the blue cape is identifiable by its draping appearance over the bear's back. Although the image appears to be edited using a low-poly style, the color and form remain consistent.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the image has undergone an editing style resembling a low-poly design, the bear still exhibits a golden-brown color on its body.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the motorcycle displaying its recognizable shape, consistent with the original appearance. Key components like a round headlight, two wheels, and handlebars are visible, even though rendered in an edited polygonal style similar to the bear. It holds the same volumetric attributes.",
