      "question": "Is the kayak still bright yellow in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kayak is held in a Polaroid-style photograph and appears visibly yellow even within this photograph. Analyzing the visual cues and world knowledge of color, the bright yellow hue is distinct and easily identifiable, therefore confirming the color's presence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black bungee cords in an X-pattern present on both ends of the kayak deck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a section of the kayak within the Polaroid-style photo. The visible part of the kayak displays black bungee cords arranged in an X-pattern near the top (bow) of the kayak. Given this visual evidence, it indicates that at least one set of bungee cords is present. However, the Polaroid photo does not display both ends of the kayak; therefore, an assumption about both ends cannot be conclusively drawn from Image B. Thus, the logic is based on limited visual information available.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a black padded seat visible inside the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the interior of the kayak through the Polaroid-style photo, revealing a seat that appears padded and black, matching the description provided. The cues visually suggest a seat designed for comfort within the kayak.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the skateboard have a dark gray grip tape surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard, visible in the Polaroid photo in Image B, features a surface that appears dark and consistent with the texture and color typical of dark gray grip tape used on skateboards for traction. This observation aligns with common skateboard designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the skateboardâ€™s trucks silver and the wheels tan in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the Polaroid photo in Image B, the skateboard is visible, and its trucks are clearly silver, while the wheels appear tan. These color characteristics are distinguishable and common for skateboards, allowing confirmation of these details from the visual evidence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the kayak and skateboard aligned vertically and placed parallel to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Polaroid photo reveals the kayak and skateboard positioned side by side. The orientation and parallel placement are clearly observed as vertical, with reference to the length alignment of each item relative to the other.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Is the background a uniform neutral beige surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background seen both outside and within the Polaroid-style photo in Image B appears consistent and uniform, presenting a neutral beige tone. This visual clue supports the interpretation that the surface is neutral and uniform.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do both the kayak and skateboard cast soft shadows to their left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the kayak and skateboard within the Polaroid photo casting shadows to the left, which appear soft and diffuse. The direction and nature of the shadows indicate a light source from the right, consistent with soft shadow characteristics.",
