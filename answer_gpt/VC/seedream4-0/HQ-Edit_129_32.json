      "question": "Is the ornate bow featuring symmetrical scrollwork and multiple spherical finials present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate bow remains intricate with symmetrical scrollwork and multiple spherical finials similar to those seen in Image A. The visible detailing of scrollwork and finials indicates that the bow’s design is unchanged. Comparing the scrollwork patterns and finial placement in Image A, the ornate structure is consistent with no apparent alterations.",

      "question": "Is the double-notched bit at the end of the key preserved in its original H-shaped configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The key in Image B displays a bit with a double notch, maintaining its H-shaped configuration that matches what is visible in Image A. Analyzing both images, the shape and form of the key bit remain unchanged, supporting the observation of this element's preservation.",

      "question": "Are the textured bands along the shaft preserved in their original placement and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows textured bands along the shaft that appear identical in placement and form when compared to those in Image A. Examining the shaft textures and band placement visually confirms that these details remain preserved without alteration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the key rendered in the original aged golden brass tone with visible highlights and shadows indicating metallic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the key in an aged golden brass tone, with highlights and shadows capturing a metallic texture consistently with Image A’s visual cues. This examination shows that the color and textural details characteristic of aged brass are preserved, reflecting a metallic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the spherical finials positioned symmetrically around the scrollwork in the bow as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spherical finials are arranged symmetrically around the bow's scrollwork, mirroring the symmetry observed in Image A. The precise alignment and placement, indicative of symmetrical design, confirm that the finials maintain their original configuration around the scrollwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the key proportionally accurate, with the bow, shaft, and bit maintaining their original relative dimensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays proportions of the bow, shaft, and bit consistent with those of Image A. Assessing their relative dimensions visually and comparing indicates that each component is proportionally accurate, with no significant deviations in their sizing relative to each other seen from the original.",
