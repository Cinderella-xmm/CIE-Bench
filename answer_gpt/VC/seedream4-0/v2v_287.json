      "question": "Does the person retain their original posture and clothing details?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's posture is very similar to the one in Image A, maintaining the same stance while interacting with the tablet. The clothing details, including the coat, scarf, and bag design, are consistent with the original image, although they have a pixelated appearance in Image B. This analysis process involved recognizing the posture and clothing items visually retained from Image A but rendered in pixel style in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person still positioned on the platform as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person remains positioned on the platform near the edge, very much like Image A. The surrounding elements, such as the train track and train itself, indicate that the person's position relative to these elements is unchanged from the original context.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the station's architectural features, including the glass roof and metal beams, retained?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pixelated version of the station's architectural features seen in Image A. The main elements, like the glass roof and metal beams, still play a visual role, albeit transformed into a blocky pixel style. Recognition of structural forms typically associated with train stations informs this analysis.",

      "question": "Are other passengers still visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes pixelated figures of people in similar positions to those seen in Image A, indicating that the passengers are still visible. The visual cues showing small groups and individual figures help identify these as passengers, despite their stylized appearance.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is interacting with the tablet in the same manner as depicted in Image A. The posture of holding the device hasn't changed from the original image, showing continuity in action despite the change in style.",
