    "Question": "Q3: Are there scattered flowers on the surface of the pedestal, including at least one pink poppy and blue blooms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are floral elements placed around the pedestal below the vase. Using world knowledge about flower appearances and colors, it can be seen that there are blue and pink elements resembling floral shapes scattered around.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase positioned centrally on the pedestal within the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase is situated approximately in the center of the pedestal as indicated by the symmetry and balance in the image composition. This alignment ensures that the vase remains the focal point of the arrangement, allowing for proper balance within the image frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do some of the flowers rest directly on the surface of the pedestal, separate from the main bouquet?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals certain floral elements positioned not as part of the main bouquet but lying directly on the pedestal surface. These elements are separate from those in the vase, likely representing intentional decoration or fallen blooms. Therefore, the observation confirms flowers positioned outside the bouquet directly onto the pedestal’s surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
