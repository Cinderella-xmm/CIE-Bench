    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like forehead design with three dots and a central triangle present on the child's forehead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, focusing on the forehead area, there is no discernible crown-like design, including three dots and a central triangle. This assessment arises from the lack of visible decoration in that region, suggesting either absence or blending with the ornate attire.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lace-like borders encircling the eyes clearly visible and symmetrically drawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible lace-like borders around the eyes. This inference is drawn from the prominent attire detail and other decorative elements, indicating a focus away from facial embellishments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a stitched mouth pattern or vertical lines. The attire and decorative elements do not imply such facial stylization, indicating a focus on costume instead of facial features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned symmetrically and maintain their original almond shape and direct forward gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide details about the eyes' shape or gaze due to editing. The ornate costume indicates focus on attire rather than facial symmetry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible makeup pattern on the face in Image B. The elaborate dress details suggest attention toward clothing rather than facial makeup symmetry.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the nose bridge clearly defined and retains its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, including the nose bridge, are edited, leaving no detail about its original shape or position. Therefore, understanding is focused on attire rather than facial structure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the natural lip contours visible beneath the painted teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present any detail on lips or painted teeth, due to facial area blending with the ornate costume. Analysis of the image emphasizes the intricate attire rather than facial contouring.",
