      "question": "Is there visible sunlight reflecting off the water surface, creating bright sparkles and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon is emerging from the water, surrounded by mist. However, the ambient lighting appears consistent and gentle without distinct bright sparkles or highlights caused by sunlight reflection on water surfaces, which would create intense and scattered bright spots typically seen in direct sunlight conditions. Hence, based on the absence of these characteristic visual cues of sunlight-induced sparkles on water, the answer is determined.",

      "question": "Are there visible patches of green moss or algae on the rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts rocks adjacent to the dragon emerging from water, but the rock surfaces do not show any visible patches of greenery or typical textures associated with moss or algae. Instead, they appear more uniform and clean without natural vegetative growth. This is contrasted against Image A, where there are distinct green patches on the rocks indicating moss or algae presence. Thus, by assessing the dragon scene's rock surfaces in contrast with typical moss visuals, the answer is concluded.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there white, foamy water at the base of the cascade and along the edges of the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon is surrounded by water and mist, but there is no indication of white, foamy water typically associated with rapids or cascades, such as seen in Image A. The water in Image B is calm with vapor or misty effect rather than turbulent or foam-laden. Therefore, the absence of cascading water characteristics leads to a specific determination.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rocks exhibit a layered, stepped formation with visible cracks and erosion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks adjacent to the dragon appear solid but do not display distinct layered formations or visible cracks with eroded surfaces as typically observed in natural cascading environments. The dragon scene rocks lack the texture and formation complexity portrayed in Image A's geological feature. Hence, based on the simplified and intact rock formations around the dragon, the conclusion is reached.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the water flow downward from the upper part of the image toward the lower part?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dragon amidst calm water where there's no visible downward water flow trajectory as found in cascading or waterfall settings shown in Image A. The water is more static around the creature with no directional flow observed. Consequently, recognizing the absence of the downward flow stream logic in Image B, the conclusion is drawn.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear contrast between the dark, wet rock surfaces and the bright, fast-moving water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon scene provides a consistent water and rock appearance without the stark visual contrast generally presented in environments with fast-moving water over dark wet rocks, such as in Image A. The dragon scene rocks and water do not exhibit indicative features of varying wetness and movement known for creating visual contrasts. Thus, based on color and texture assessments, the answer is inferred.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible water droplets or mist suspended in the air above the falling water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures mist and water vapor surrounding the dragon as it emerges, indicating suspended moisture in the air. While not referred to as directly falling water spray, the mist surrounding the dragon serves as an environmental detail reflective of suspended air moisture. Thus, in consideration of the dragon's misty surroundings akin to suspended water vapor, the logic confirms the presence of these elements.",
