    "Question": "Q1: Is the original lighting style, including the placement and intensity of shadows, preserved?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a large interior space with shadows from the windows cast on the floor. The shadows are relatively intense due to the amount of natural light flooding in from the windows. In Image A, the lighting is also natural, with shadows cast from objects on the furniture and wall. However, the setting differs greatly, leading to different shadow arrangements and intensities based on the architecture and window placement. This indicates changes in environmental lighting setup, not preserved.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is natural light still illuminating the scene from the same direction as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, shadows are cast by natural light entering from certain directions that allows patterns to form on the floor from the windows.
