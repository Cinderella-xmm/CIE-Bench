    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the fish depicted in a continuous, coiled circular posture with its head pointing toward the upper right and tail curving beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fish in Image B is crafted as a crystal sculpture in a museum-like setting. It is designed in a circular posture, with the head positioned towards the upper right. The tail curves beneath the body, completing the circular form of the fish. This analysis is based on the observation of the circular, continuous shape of the crystal fish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three distinct barbels extending from the lower jaw of the fish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish is created from clear blue crystal, which allows for detailed inspection of its facial features. However, there are no visible barbels, which are whisker-like structures, extending from the lower jaw. This observation concludes there are no distinct barbels present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dorsal fin located along the upper back of the fish and shaped with a serrated edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the crystal fish shows a sleek, stylized form. The dorsal fin is located on the upper back, designed with a serrated, jagged edge that reflects light differently. The crystal design enhances the serrated appearance through its faceted surface.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the scales arranged in overlapping rows along the body of the fish, running from head to tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal fish sculpture features a faceted surface, mimicking the natural arrangement of fish scales. The facets create an overlapping illusion running from head to tail, emphasizing a scale-like texture. This observation identifies a structured, scale-like arrangement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tail of the fish curve underneath the body and connect near the head, completing a nearly full circle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the fish in Image B indeed curves beneath the body and extends towards the head, creating a circular design. This nearly completes a full loop, signifying the distinct circular art style employed in the crystal sculpture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two pectoral fins visible on the side of the fish, one near the head and one further back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal fish is crafted with intricate detail. However, only one pectoral fin is visible near the head, and there is no indication of a second fin located further back. This pattern confirms the absence of two separate pectoral fins.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the fish carving contained within a square-shaped panel with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fish is represented in a freestanding crystal sculpture, not within any panel, square-shaped or otherwise. Hence, the context of a square panel with rounded corners is absent in Image B, contrasting with the wooden carving in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
