    "Question": "Q1: Are the cheetahs still depicted in their original seated and standing postures on the earthen mound?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are depicted as steampunk-inspired figures with mechanical parts, but their postures are maintained as in the original image. The cheetah at the front is seated, and the cheetah behind is standing. This suggests the editor retained their original postures while creatively altering their appearance.",
