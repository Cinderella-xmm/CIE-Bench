      "question": "Is the overall shape of the food arrangement a perfect heart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart shape appears composed of LEGO bricks, which naturally have blocky edges, making it difficult to achieve perfect curves or rounded shapes like a perfect heart. Typically, hearts have smooth and curved edges, but the construction nature of the LEGO pieces introduces a more faceted appearance. Therefore, while Image B represents a heart, it cannot be described as a 'perfect' heart due to its construction.",

      "question": "Is the avocado shown as half-cut with the pit cavity visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of an avocado is constructed from LEGO bricks, emulating the appearance of a half-cut avocado with a pit cavity through color arrangement and brick placement. The distinct green border and a darker inner section visually suggest the typical appearance of an avocado with the cavity for the pit visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the asparagus stalks bundled together with a visible twine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the asparagus is constructed in such a way that it seems bundled, and there is a differentiation in the shape and color, emulating a twine-like structure that appears to wrap around them. This mimics the real-world practice of bundling asparagus for presentation or sale.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, LEGO representations of blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries are grouped together at the top-left portion of the heart. This arrangement reflects the natural grouping often seen in food displays, maintaining a similar orientation to their position in a realistic, orderly fashion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of what appears to be a red onion is constructed near the representations of broccoli and garlic. This arrangement mirrors the typical placement seen in grocery setups to denote related vegetables. The colors and form used hint at the identity of these items as a red onion, broccoli, and garlic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several white objects utilizing circular LEGO pieces situated near the center, with at least three represented, indicating the presence of mushrooms. The positioning and grouping in this central area reflect a typical food platter setup.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area at the bottom-right side of the heart shape contains LEGO bricks arranged to resemble a large red bell pepper. This is indicated by the red color and elongated shape associated with bell peppers. The strategic placement and coloration provide a clear representation of a red bell pepper.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop is a flat, neutral gray color which appears to serve as a stand for the LEGO construction. This choice provides a contrast to the colorful heart-shaped design, highlighting the vibrancy and details of the food arrangement without distraction.",
