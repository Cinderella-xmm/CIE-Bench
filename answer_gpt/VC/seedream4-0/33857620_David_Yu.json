      "question": "Is the white-framed window visible on the front face of the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed structure retains the A-frame house design, which includes a front face with a white-framed window. The fantastical elements like the wings and ice decorations have not altered the basic structure of the house section, confirming the presence of the white-framed window on the front face.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small red structure located to the left of the main chalet still present in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fantastical transformation has introduced a creature-like structure with a house for a head, but the smaller red structure seen in Image A is not visible. This suggests that the transformation or editing process removed or obscured other elements around the main focus, which is the fantasy creature.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the waterway flow from the bottom-right corner toward the center-left of the image, maintaining its original course?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the waterway can be seen flowing from the bottom-right toward the center-left. The path of the water remains consistent in Image B compared to Image A, indicating that the editing focused primarily on the structure and not the natural waterway.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the large patch of snow located directly in front of the chalet still visible and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the transformed creature, and upon closer inspection, it appears that the large patch of snow in front of the original chalet structure is not visible. This suggests the editing prioritized the fantastical creature element over keeping the snow visibility.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are moss-covered rocks visible along the edges of the stream in the transformed scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the rocks along the edges of the stream display a green coloration, typically indicative of moss. In Image B, certain parts of the creature's legs also appear moss-covered, suggesting continuity in the visual theme from the environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed structure located in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature stands where the original structure was, in the mid-ground and slightly to the right of the center. The central focus has shifted to this creature, but its positioning aligns with where the chalet was positioned in Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the mountain peaks visible in the background, with snow patches and mist covering their upper portions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B continues to show mountain peaks with patches of snow and mist enveloping their tops, similar to Image A. The editing for the fantastical creature didn't alter these distinctive background features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
