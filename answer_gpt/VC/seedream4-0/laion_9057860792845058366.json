      "question": "Are the two orange horn-like protrusions on the top of the robot's head present and unchanged in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two orange horn-like protrusions are visible at the top of the robot's head. They retain their shape similar to typical robot or mechanical designs where such features might indicate antennae or decorative elements. Since no changes in shape or position are indicated, they are assumed unchanged.",

      "question": "Is the large red rectangular plate on the robot's chest intact, maintaining its original size, shape, and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large red rectangular plate on the robot's chest appears intact with no visible alterations to its size, shape, or placement. This element is a common focal point in robot designs, often representing a central component or armor piece, which has been preserved.",

      "question": "Are the red knee pads present on both legs, positioned at the joint area and matching the original shape and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red knee pads are visible on both legs, positioned at the knee joint as expected in robotic or armored figures. They match the original shape and color, serving as a functional and aesthetic element of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hands of the robot fully black, with a claw-like or articulated finger design, and positioned as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's hands are fully black, featuring an articulated design typical of robots, suggesting dexterity and mechanical function. They are positioned similarly to Image A, with no significant alterations observed.",

      "question": "Do the robot’s feet maintain their angular, blocky shape with black toe segments and red accent plates near the ankles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B presents feet with angular, blocky shapes, typical of robotic models for stability and design consistency. The feet have black toe segments and red accents near the ankles, maintaining the original design elements seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Is the robot in the same dynamic standing pose, with the left arm slightly raised and the body angled toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot retains a dynamic pose, characterized by a slight bend in the knees and a forward-leaning stance. The left arm is slightly raised, and the body is angled towards the viewer, maintaining the action-oriented pose from Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
