      "question": "Are the intricate floral and vine motifs present in their original pattern and spatial arrangement across the body and lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot features floral and vine motifs similar to those in Image A, but the arrangement appears slightly different on the lid and body. This indicates that the original pattern and spatial arrangement have been altered.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central chamber rendered in a rich camel red hue matching the original teapot’s body color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central chamber of the teapot in Image B displays a rich camel red hue similar to Image A, based on well-saturated red tones visible on the body. The color consistency suggests matching hues.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle is clearly visible with distinct contours, similar to Image A. Given the smooth, curved profile that closely resembles common teapot handles, the representation is accurate.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a spout that is curved and elongated, matching the proportions seen in Image A. Both spouts appear consistent with refined teapot design emphasizing their preserved shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base structure differs as the decorative silver band seen in Image A is replaced with a plain base having an emblem. This indicates the base structure is altered in form and position.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows metallic details that appear raised and embossed, similar to those in Image A. The surface characteristics indicate the retention of embossed textures over flat painted designs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
