    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the number \"7\" clearly visible on both the front fender and side panel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a black can with a motorbike silhouette rather than a motorcycle with numbers on its fender and side panel. Hence, Image B does not depict a motorcycle with visible numbers. Therefore, the number '7' is not visible in any context within Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the track outline labeled \"5/5\" present in the upper-right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, there's a track outline present but without any label or numbering like '5/5'. The focus in Image B is more on the can which contains the silhouette of a motorbike and not marked with '5/5'.",

      "question": "Does the dust trail originate directly from the rear wheel of the motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict an actual motorcycle or any motion that would create a dust trail from a rear wheel, as the image focuses on a product can and not an active scene with a motorcycle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no detailed depiction of a rider's posture or hands gripping handlebars. Instead, it features a silhouette of a motorcyclist on a can, which doesn't provide enough detail to ascertain posture or grip.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B centers on the depiction of a can and does not feature a motorcycle, so there is no presence of a front wheel with a blue rim to be identified.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rider positioned in the foreground with the desert landscape behind them and the track outline in the upper-right corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main focus is on the can with the motorbike silhouette, and while there is a desert-like backdrop, the rider is not depicted in the foreground as a separate entity from the can imagery. The track outline is not present in the corner with any emphasized foreground rider.",
