    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the golden-brown crust of the pie slice present with visible crumbly texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie slice is adorned with cartoon-style decorations, but the original golden-brown crust with a crumbly texture is still visible around the edges. While the presence of illustrative elements may distract, the underlying characteristics of the pie crust can still be identified.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark purple-blue berry filling with visible burst spots present in the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the berry filling with a cartoonish overlay of blueberry illustrations and nutrition labels. Nonetheless, the dark purple hue of the berries in the filling can still be discerned, maintaining the appearance of burst spots beneath the overlay.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a single green mint leaf placed on top of the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though Image B includes illustrative elements, a mint leaf is depicted next to the cartoon berries rather than the real mint leaf seen in Image A. The presence of illustrations modifies the location and context of the leaf.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pie slice served on a white circular ceramic plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pie slice in Image B is served on a white circular ceramic plate, identical to how it is presented in Image A. The presence of illustrations around the pie does not obscure the clarity of the plateâ€™s circular shape and white color.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tea mug visible with a handle on the right side and a tea bag string hanging over the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea mug has a handle on the right side, but it has an added cartoon-like face and holds a 'healthy eating tips' sign. While the illustrations modify the mug's appearance significantly, the original handle orientation and tea bag string placement from Image A are still present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the scene set on a smooth, matte gray tabletop surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The matte gray tabletop surface is consistent and visible in Image B, despite the addition of overlays and illustrations. These elements relate to the food items and mug rather than fundamentally altering the tabletop environment.",
