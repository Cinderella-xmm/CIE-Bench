      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a teddy bear wearing a white lab coat, not a girl. The teddy bear is not wearing any glasses. By observing the image carefully and combining it with general knowledge of what glasses look like, it's clear that no character in Image B is wearing glasses.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
