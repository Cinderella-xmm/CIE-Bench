      "question": "Is the clock face circular and positioned in the center of the wooden frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is clearly visible as circular and appears centrally positioned within the overall structure of the frame. The visual symmetry and the manner in which the frame encloses the clock indicate that the design places the clock face at the central focus. Common design principles for such clocks often emphasize these central and symmetrical placements to enhance visual appeal.",

      "question": "Are the Roman numerals arranged in clockwise order from I to XII around the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we observe the presence of Roman numerals around the circular clock face. They start with 'I' at the position typically associated with 1 o'clock and proceed in a sequential manner up to 'XII,' arranged in a circular and clockwise manner which is conventional in clocks for time representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pendulum hang directly below the clock face, supported by two vertical rods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a pendulum positioned below the clock face, and it is visibly attached by what seem to be two slim rods extending downward, ensuring the pendulum's alignment with the clock face. This setup is standard in pendulum clocks for maintaining stability and consistent movement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two fluted columns, one on each side of the clock face, extending from the top to the bottom of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, we can identify two columns that exhibit fluting—a classical design characteristic—located on either side of the clock face. They appear to span from the top of the frame to its base, contributing to a balanced and structured appearance that is often inspired by classical architecture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a decorative crest with leaf-like carvings located at the top center of the clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a prominent decorative crest is visible at the top center of the clock’s frame. It features carvings that resemble foliage—a design often used for aesthetic enhancement in wooden structures. These leaf-like motifs may symbolize nature or growth, common themes in decorative art.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question": "Is there a circular medallion located at the center of the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the center of the clock face contains a circular feature. However, upon closer inspection, this feature consists of intricately designed hands and a decorative pattern rather than a separate medallion. Thus, it is not correct to identify it as a distinct medallion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there two small rounded feet extending downward from the bottom corners of the clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock frame does have elements slightly protruding from the bottom corners, which are designed in a rounded style reminiscent of feet. These additions contribute to the clock’s classic aesthetics and might serve a structural or decorative purpose. Their presence at the corners suggests a functional design aimed at stability.",
