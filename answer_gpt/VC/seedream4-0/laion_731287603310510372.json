      "question": "Is the gray flat cap still present on the man's head, maintaining its original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray flat cap is clearly visible on the man's head, similar to Image A. The cap is positioned in an identical manner, preserving its shape and tilt. Both images show the cap's uniform placement over the man's head. Without having to compare, the visual cues suggest the cap has not changed in position or shape.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small brown leather tag visible on the side of the cap near the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap does not have the small brown leather tag visible on the side. While Image A shows the tag can be identified behind the ear region on the cap, Image B's vintage or poster style editing might have resulted in the omission of such details. The styling seems to have obscured these minor details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the man wearing a heather gray crew-neck t-shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the man is wearing a heather gray crew-neck t-shirt. The edited image retains this specific part of clothing, with the fabric texture and crew neck shape evident, unchanged from the original.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the man have a mustache and a goatee?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not reveal facial hair due to the graphical style and the blur of the face. However, even if visible in Image A, Image B has intentionally omitted personal facial details for artistic or thematic reasons, like maintaining some anonymity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the man is depicted in a leftward-facing profile. His body and head positioning are consistent indicating this leftward orientation. This profile perspective remains unchanged in the edited version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the textures of the cap and shirt consistent with a heather gray fabric (i.e., showing a mix of light and dark fibers)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the overall color of the cap and shirt is discernible as gray, the texture that defines heather fabric, composed of mixed fibers, is less apparent due to the stylized, poster-like graphic. In Image A, this texture is visible. The edited version might not effectively capture subtle textures due to its stylistic presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the cap sitting naturally on the man's head, aligned with the contours of his skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cap looks proportionately aligned along his head, comparable to Image A where it rests naturally. Despite the vintage styling, the cap retains its alignment with the shape and form of the head.",
