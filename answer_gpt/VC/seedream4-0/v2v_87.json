      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image retain large, fan-shaped ears that extend outward from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is made of Lego bricks, which have inherent limitations in replicating detailed anatomical features. However, by observing the arrangement of blocks around the head where ears would typically be, they don't resemble large, fan-shaped ears extending outward as seen in real elephants. Lego blocks usually cannot capture such details as they are simplistic and angular. Thus, combining common knowledge about Lego design limitations and visual cues indicates that the elephant's ears are not large and fan-shaped.",

      "question": "Are the elephant’s tusks long, curved, and off-white in color, extending downward from the upper jaw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows tusks constructed from long, curved Lego pieces that are off-white, representing the typical tusks of an elephant. The placement and shape achieved using these Lego pieces mimic the key characteristics of tusks seen in real elephants, including their downward extension from the upper jaw. Thus, the tusks appear accurately designed in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the elephant’s skin depicted with deep wrinkles and folds, particularly on the trunk, legs, and ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Lego pieces provide a smooth surface and do not allow for intricate textural details such as wrinkles and folds. In Image B, the elephant, being a Lego creation, lacks the ability to reflect deep wrinkles and folds as seen in real elephant skin. The Lego bricks present a flat and uniform texture. Considering the generic properties of Lego surfaces, the elephant’s skin is not shown with wrinkles or folds.",

      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet show five distinct toes on each foot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, constructed with Lego, presents the elephant with simplistic, blocky legs without detailed anatomical features such as toes. The nature of Lego structures, which tend to abstract complex details, results in the absence of discernible toes. By evaluating the design constraints of Lego models, it can be concluded that the elephant’s feet do not show distinct toes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a backpack but rather a glass case with a Lego model inside it. The Lego elephant itself is partially constructed with red blocks, but there's no dedicated backpack object in the same form as Image A. Without the presence of a red backpack object for comparison, it is incorrect to claim the red depiction matches the original image’s backpack.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a backpack next to the Lego elephant. Instead, both the elephant and a human figure are encased in a glass box with no separate backpack object visible. Using knowledge about photographic framing and object placement, the edited image lacks a backpack as an individual object.",

      "question": "Is the animal clearly identifiable as an African elephant based on its ear size, tusk shape, and overall body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the limited detail that Lego bricks provide, Image B uses certain features like tusk shape and structural size to represent an elephant. However, the ears do not resemble the large, fan-shaped ears associated with African elephants. Legos usually simplify features, and thus, without the distinctive ear size, the figure doesn’t convincingly portray traits specific to African elephants.",
