      "question": "Is the AXE logo still visible on the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the AXE logo is prominently displayed on the front of the container. It is clearly visible and recognizable. The visual cues, such as the font and placement, indicate that the branding has not been obstructed or removed. Therefore, the AXE logo is still visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container mostly retains its original cylindrical shape. However, it appears to have some structural cracks, and the top is open with a nebula-like element emerging from it. Despite these alterations, the general shape remains cylindrical.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the container still prominently features fiery red and energetic pink hues in its design. This is consistent with the explosive and dynamic visual theme originally intended. These colors are easily identifiable and not significantly altered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the label closely, the net weight text, 'NET WT 2.64 OZ (75g),' is still visible. Although the container's imagery has been altered with additional elements, the text remains legible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container appears mostly intact except for several visible cracks on its surface. The nebula is emerging through the cracked portion at the top, suggesting that the container has been altered to showcase the nebula dramatically. However, aside from the cracks, the rest of the container structure remains intact.",
