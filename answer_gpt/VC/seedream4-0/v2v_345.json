      "question": "Is the USB-C port located centrally on the bottom edge of the smartphone, flanked by two sets of three circular speaker holes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the smartphone is observed with attention to its bottom edge. The USB-C port is centrally located between two sets of circular speaker holes, each set containing three holes on either side. This design is consistent with many smartphones. Therefore, the answer is based on identifying the arrangement of these port and speaker holes visually.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smartphone placed diagonally on the wooden surface, with its bottom edge closer to the viewer than the top edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the smartphone lying on the wooden surface in a manner where the bottom edge is slightly tilted and closer to the viewer compared to the top edge. This diagonal orientation can be confirmed as typical for product photography to emphasize features like ports and speakers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the wooden surface display a consistent horizontal grain pattern with warm brown tones and visible wood fibers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden surface exhibits a horizontal grain pattern that is consistent across its visible portions, with warm brown tones that create a natural wooden appearance. The visibility of wood fibers helps confirm this observation, which is characteristic of many wooden surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color with a soft blur effect, providing a shallow depth of field?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights a background that is uniform in its beige color, consistent throughout the section visible. The soft blur effect suggests a shallow depth of field, typically used in photography to focus attention on foreground subjects like the mouse and smartphone.",

      "question": "Is the mouse positioned to the left of the smartphone, with both objects resting on the same wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B demonstrates that the pixelated mouse is positioned directly left of the smartphone, both in contact with the same wooden surface. This spatial arrangement is clear from the orientation and alignment relative to one another.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pixelated representation of the mouse is shown facing the smartphone. The orientation of its head, turned toward the smartphone, is an intentional pose reflecting interest or interaction, common in such compositions.",
