      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are inside a snow globe and are wearing white baseball uniforms with vertical stripes.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters inside the snow globe are shown wearing black helmets that have a red letter 'C' on them.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters within the snow globe do not hold wooden baseball bats. Instead, the bats are placed standing upright between the two characters. In Image A, two of the individuals are holding the bats. This change in the representation of the bats between the images shows that the characters in Image B do not hold baseball bats.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on two chibi-style characters inside a snow globe, and there is no representation of a central figure like in Image A who is wearing a blue jacket. The scene's focus is on the characters with baseball uniforms only, indicating the absence of an individual in a blue jacket.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters have bright and cheerful facial expressions with smiles, which is a typical presentation style for such figures. While Image A had blurred faces making it difficult to determine expressions, the joyful appearance in Image B suggests the characters indeed have cheerful expressions, aligning with the general aesthetic of chibi representations.",
