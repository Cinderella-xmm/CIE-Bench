      "question": "Does the edited image retain the alternating tan and dark brown pattern on the turtle's shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the turtle is anthropomorphized as a chibi-style character. The pattern on its shell is present in a stylized format, with variations in shades suggesting an attempt to reflect the original turtle's alternating shell pattern, although simplified for the style. The presence of any shell pattern representation indicates some level of retention.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the turtle's limb structure, even if the limbs are stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the turtle figure has long slender limbs, characteristic of chibi or cartoonish styles, resembling human legs rather than the original turtle's limbs. Despite the stylization, it represents limbs indicating a modified structure for the character.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a smooth, stylized chibi figure with a simple shell design lacking texture details seen in the original turtle shell. The cartoon style does not depict intricate textures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a chibi character with a round head and large, expressive eyes common in chibi art, but the general structure, such as the presence of a head and eyes, is consistent with the original turtle albeit completely stylized.",
