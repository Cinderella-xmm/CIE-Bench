    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pink-red feathery flower clusters present in both the foreground and background, positioned on slender green stems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene includes pink-red feathery flower clusters both in the foreground and background. These clusters appear on slender green stems, which is evident as the color and texture of the flowers and stems are consistent with real-world botanical features. These visual cues support the observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, symmetrical reflection of the dragonfly visible on the water surface directly beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly exhibits a symmetrical reflection directly beneath it on the water surface. This can be deduced from the alignment of the dragonfly's body and wings with their mirrored counterparts below, a typical phenomenon observed when a reflective surface like water is present with minimal distortion.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water surface calm and reflective, with small sparkling particles scattered across it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface is very reflective, displaying a mirror-like quality that suggests a calm state. There are small sparkling particles visible, likely intended to represent reflections or disturbances on the water, consistent with a serene and picturesque scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dragonfly hovering just above the water surface, with its body parallel to the water plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly is depicted as hovering above the water, but its body is more angled than parallel to the water plane. This suggests that the dragonfly is not strictly parallel, as hovering above the surface typically involves some elevation and inclination.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bright, diffused light source in the upper center of the image, casting a golden glow through the green foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bright area in the upper region, but it is more of a diffused white or blue light rather than a golden glow. This diffused light filters down, suggesting a source, but the color and spread do not match the description of casting a golden glow.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there slender green stems and leafy structures extending from the water, supporting the pink-red flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink-red flowers are observed on slender green stems, which extend from the water. This setup is natural for such vegetation, with the stems providing support to the flower clusters, aligning with the scene's botanic elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background composed of blurred green foliage with visible patches of sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of green foliage that is blurred, with variations in color that could indicate sunlight filtering through. This blurred effect is common in nature photography to emphasize the main subject while creating depth in the scene.",
