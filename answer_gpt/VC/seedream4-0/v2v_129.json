        "** Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are nine stickers, each showing a chibi character seemingly engaged in painting activities, indicated by the presence of a brush and paper. Despite variations in expressions and poses, the character appears focused on the artistic task across all stickers, suggesting active engagement in painting. This is supported by visual cues such as the character holding brushes and paper with visible colors.",

      "question": "** Are the painting tools (palette, brushes, paper, glass of water) present and interacted with by the character in each sticker?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, featuring multiple stickers of a character, shows consistent presence of painting elements like brushes and paper. Each sticker has these essential painting tools depicted, and the character appears to be interacting with these items, demonstrating the use of tools in each scene. Whether all the specified items like a palette or a glass of water appear each time isn't assured for all stickers but key tools are consistently interacted with.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the character across the nine stickers in Image B, she is consistently depicted with brown hair and a beige shirt throughout all stickers. This uniformity suggests that her appearance remains the same in terms of hair color and clothing across the different representations.",

        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at least one of the stickers shows signs of watercolor strokes on the paper, evidenced by small patches of color on the character's paper. This indicates that the character is actively painting and that watercolor strokes are visibly depicted in at least one scene.",

      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains cartoon-style stickers of a character, which generally do not convey lighting effects such as natural lighting realistically. The stickers focus more on the character's actions and expressions without employing detailed lighting effects typical of natural settings. Thus, there is no discernible depiction of natural lighting in the stickers.",
