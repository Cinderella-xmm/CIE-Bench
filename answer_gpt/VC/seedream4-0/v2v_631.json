        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing gold hoop earrings, referencing the visual cue where a bold, golden hoop is visible extending from the ear on the left side of the image.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred, making it impossible to determine the expression or gaze direction, but given the stylistic depiction and lack of facial features, it suggests a simplified character rendering typically indicating a lack of expression. However, due to the absence of facial clarity, it's determined to not comment on expression or gaze.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized, cartoon-like interpretation of the subject. While it maintains the overall hairstyle and clothing style, the skin tone is part of a more artistic portrayal, differing from Image Aâ€™s realistic depiction. The general proportions may be exaggerated or altered due to the cartoon aesthetic, so it does not preserve the realistic skin tone and proportions.",
