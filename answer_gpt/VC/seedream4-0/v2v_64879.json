      "question": "Are the industrial structures still positioned on the left side of the image, maintaining their relative arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures are positioned on the left side of the image, and their arrangement seems consistent with the original placement as seen in Image A, despite the artistic transformation into a more painting-like style. The recognizable features such as the vertical lines of the structures and their location on the slope are preserved, which indicates their relative arrangement is maintained.",

      "question": "Does the road still curve gently through the valley, connecting the industrial area to the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road appears as a prominent brownish path curving through the valley, maintaining its role as a connection between the industrial area and the rest of the scene. In Image A, the road is also present, curving through the snowy valley. The consistent curvature and relative direction of the road from the industrial area towards the further landscape indicate that the connection is retained.",

      "question": "Are there still frosted trees visible along the sides of the valley?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, despite its artistic rendering similar to Van Gogh's style, displays trees with brush strokes resembling frosted branches along the sides of the valley. In Image A, the frosted trees are naturally visible along the slopes of the valley. The continued presence of visually analogous frosted trees in both images suggests they remain visible.",

      "question": "Are the distant snow-covered peaks still visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows snow-covered peaks in the background, depicted with artistic strokes but maintaining the general appearance and location of distant peaks covered in snow. In Image A, these peaks are naturally visible at the top portion of the image. The consistency in placement and depiction of snowy peaks ensures their visibility is retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the industrial structures still retain their general shape and form despite artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although transformed into a more impressionistic style in Image B, the industrial structures are still identifiable through their general shape and form, including the vertical elements and angular shapes typical of industrial buildings. Image A contains these structures in a realistic form, which provides a basis for comparison. The maintained structural integrity in both images indicates the general shape and form are preserved.",
