    {

      "question": "Are the silhouetted tree branches in the foreground clearly visible and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant feature is a large stone creature with wings, and there are some trees visible near its roots. These trees do not correspond to the silhouetted tree branches in Image A, which are a part of the foreground framing the mountain scene. Thus, the original silhouetted tree branches from Image A are not visible in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the small green hilltop with sparse vegetation visible just above the mist layer in the mid-ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a large stone creature standing on what appears to be a green hill with some trees, but this does not correspond to the simple green hilltop visible in Image A. In Image A, the hill is below the mist, and in Image B, the creature and its environment replace this feature entirely.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky retain its original gradient from deep blue at the top to soft pink and lavender near the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is mostly blue with a light hint of pink and lavender near the horizon. This suggests the gradient has been partially retained from Image A, where the top is a deep blue, transitioning into softer colors near the horizon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous layer of mist or fog extending horizontally beneath the mountain, obscuring its lower slopes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feature of a large stone creature takes center stage, and the scene does not include any prominent horizontal layer of mist or fog found in Image A, where it obscures the lower slopes of the mountains.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground trees, mid-ground hill, and background mountain arranged in their original relative positions, maintaining the depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has replaced the natural landscape of Image A with a large stone creature, disrupting the original arrangement of foreground trees, mid-ground hill, and background mountain from Image A. The depth of the scene, as originally seen, is not preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the tree branches retain their original fine details, including individual twigs and leaf clusters, in silhouette form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature the silhouetted tree branches that are prominent in Image A. Instead, it shows a completely different scene with a large creature and a few non-silhouetted trees around its base, which do not match the detailed silhouetted forms present in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the peak of the mountain still positioned at the highest point in the scene, serving as the central focal point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central and highest focal point is the large stone creature, which dominates the composition. This contrasts with Image A, where the mountain peak is the central and highest focal point. Thus, the original mountain peak no longer serves as the highest or central focal point in the edited image.",
