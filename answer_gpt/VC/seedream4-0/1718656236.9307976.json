      "question": "Does the subject retain the original facial structure, including the shape of the eyes, nose, and lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment of facial features cannot be conducted as the face is blurred, and we are instructed to exclude the blurred face in the evaluation. Therefore, there's no basis to determine if the facial structure retains its original features.",

    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, earrings are visible, hanging from both earlobes. This detail is indicated by the presence of ornamental objects near the ear region, connecting via the earlobes. World knowledge of traditional attire often includes such adornments.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear indications of braids extending from the head, hanging over the shoulders. This is identifiable by the texture and pattern typical of braids positioned symmetrically on both sides.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklace in Image B is visible around the neck, and multiple strands lie on the chest. While there is no singular pendant in the usual central position, the layered necklaces serve a decorative role akin to a pendant.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the subject facing directly forward with a neutral expression, maintaining eye contact with the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the blurred face, the position of the headgear and symmetry of the attire suggest the subject is facing forward. There is no indication of expression because facial features are obscured. Thus, assumptions on expression neutrality cannot be made.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that appears neutral and softly blurred, similar to studio backgrounds used for portrait photography. This lack of distinct objects or patterns aligns with a neutral backdrop characteristic.",
