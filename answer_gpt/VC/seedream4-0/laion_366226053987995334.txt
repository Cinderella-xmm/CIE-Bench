    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall shape of each earring a symmetrical, elongated feather with pointed tips at both ends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the earrings are stylized characters resembling feathers with faces, arms, and legs. The shape depicted is that of a cartoonish feather, but due to the exaggerated and anthropomorphized characteristics in the image, it's hard to determine if the tips of the feathers are pointed at both ends in the traditional sense. The shape is playful and simplified, moving away from a strictly elongated feather form.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does each earring contain a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the earrings as characters with no specific details such as a centrally located oval black stone set within a metallic bezel. The design focuses on expressive, animated features instead of detailed jewelry components.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there fine, parallel engraved lines extending outward from the central spine on both sides of the feather?",
    "explanation": "The earrings in Image B are rendered as cartoon characters, and while they may have feather-like elements, the focus is on character design, not on detailed engraved lines. Hence, there are no visible fine parallel lines as a feather would typically have.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the metal of the earrings rendered in a silver tone with a matte or slightly oxidized (antiqued) finish?",
    "explanation": "The characters are rendered in a cartoon style with no particular attention to materials like metal or finishes such as a silver tone or antiquing. The illustration focuses on high contrast and vibrant expression, not on simulating metallic textures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does each earring include a curved hook earwire connected via a small spherical bead to the main feather body?",
    "explanation": "In the cartoon style of Image B, there is an exaggerated depiction of earring hooks. While they maintain a recognizable form resembling a hook with a connecting element, they are drawn in a cartoon style without realistic detailing such as spherical beads.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the two earrings identical in shape, size, and orientation, mirrored across a vertical axis?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters represented as earrings are designed to mimic earring shapes, and they visually appear to be similar in size and orientation. However, due to their stylized and animated character forms, some exaggeration might affect perfect symmetry. They exhibit similarity akin to a mirrored form but within a cartoon context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
