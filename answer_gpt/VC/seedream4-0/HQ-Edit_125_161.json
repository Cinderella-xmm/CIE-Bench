      "question": "Is the herringbone-patterned wooden floor present and accurately rendered in the same layout and orientation as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the herringbone-patterned wooden floor is visible, laid out with the same orientation and arrangement as seen in Image A. The floor still exhibits the characteristic zigzag pattern typical of herringbone designs, consisting of rectangular wooden planks arranged in a V-shape. The consistency in layout and orientation between both images suggests that it is accurately rendered in the edited version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical and horizontal moldings of the wall paneling preserved, including the recessed rectangular panels and crown molding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical and horizontal moldings are still evident, forming a series of rectangular recessed panels along the wall. These characteristics align with Image A, where the wall paneling consists of prominent molding lines, creating structured rectangular shapes. The presence of these architectural details in the edited image indicates their preservation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the oval-shaped skylight or oculus at the top of the spiral staircase still present and positioned centrally above the coil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is an indication of light entering from above, the distinct oval-shaped skylight that centrally positioned over the staircase in Image A is not visibly prominent due to the added presence of the snake-like creature spiraling around the stairs. This alteration implies the visual prominence of the skylight has shifted in the edited version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the graphite pencil visible in the lower-right corner of the image, angled diagonally across the drawing’s border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graphite pencil is still present in the lower-right corner, maintaining its diagonal angle across the drawing’s border, consistent with the depiction in Image A. This detail, acting as a visual marker of the artwork's creation medium, remains unchanged in both versions, confirming its presence.",

      "question": "Is the thin ruled border enclosing the entire drawing present, with short perpendicular lines at each corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a thin ruled border is visible enclosing the drawing, accompanied by short perpendicular lines at each corner, matching the characteristics of Image A. This border, serving as a framing element for the artwork, remains intact and consistent between the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the perspective of the scene maintain convergence toward the oval skylight at the top, with all architectural lines aligning accordingly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the architectural lines maintain a sense of convergence typical in such scenes, the visual focal point directed towards where the skylight is in Image A is disrupted by the presence of the snake-like creature. Thus, the clarity of convergence towards an oval skylight is less emphasized in the edited scene.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tonal gradients on the walls and floor, particularly the darker shadows near the base and lighter areas under the skylight, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tonal gradients present in Image A are still observable, with darker shadows rendered near the base of the walls and lighter areas closer to the upper region, suggesting illumination from the top. Despite additional elements, these gradients continue to convey depth and light distribution as in the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor appears to have been altered with a snake-like creature present, but the texture and grain indicated by fine parallel lines are still faintly visible on the parts of the floor not obscured, matching the detail demonstrated in Image A.",
