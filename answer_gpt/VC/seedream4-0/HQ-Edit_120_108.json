      "question": "Is the book physically present and open on the wooden desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue indicating the book is physically present and open is the clear rendering of pages and the detailed illustration of their contents, such as diagrams or notes, that viewers can see. The way the pages of the book are curling upwards further substantiates a sense of presence and physicality. The book appears to be on the desktop with its spine and back cover clearly touching the desk's surface, confirming its physical presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp is depicted with detailed intricate engravings, a warm brass color, and an arm design including gears, suggesting its ornate nature. It is visually located on the left side of the desk, and its arm, designed with articulating joints and gears, is extended towards the open book, directing light onto it.",

      "question": "Is the desk made of wood with visible grain texture and located beneath all objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk does not appear to be made of wood. Instead, the surface shows a leather texture with rivets around the edges, suggesting a leather-topped or leather-covered setting rather than wood. The texture and color of the desk surface do not exhibit typical characteristics like grain that would be visible in wooden furniture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

To the left side of the main book, there is a smaller, closed book, confirming the arrangement of books as described. This layout corresponds to the identification and position specific to the items as illustrated.",

      "question": "Does the lamp emit a focused beam of light that falls directly onto the open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration shows the lamp with a distinct light source direction. The light from the lamp produces a spotlight-like effect that illuminates the open book directly. This suggests a focused beam directed specifically at the book, highlighting its pages for reading or viewing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette primarily consists of warm browns seen in the desk, golds from the lamp and gear elements, and deep blues from the books. These colors align with a vintage aesthetic, often signified by leather and brass materials, giving the scene a warm, antiquated feel. The chosen colors and texture suggest richness and an old-world charm.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall behind the desk does not appear to be stark dark teal. It is more of a muted dark color with floral accents on the side. The texture is present, but the predominant color isn't a distinct dark teal, leaning more towards a dark leather or textured wallpaper appearance.",
