    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there visible steam rising from the broccoli/tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam is visibly rising from the top of the tree-like broccoli structure. The steam is depicted as wispy and translucent, as commonly seen when something is hot or has just been cooked. This visual cue is consistent with how steam typically appears in photographs or illustrations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree rest on a white plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the broccoli/tree on a natural forest floor environment with soil and foliage visible, and there is no plate in sight. This is in contrast with a typical dining setup where a plate is visible to hold food items.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the broccoli/tree primarily green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B, which is intended to represent broccoli or a tree, is predominantly green. This is evident from the rich, verdant hue of its floret-like structure, which matches the typical color of broccoli or leaves on a tree.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characteristic florets of the broccoli discernible on the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper portion of the object closely resembles broccoli florets. These small, clustered, rounded shapes are characteristic of broccoli and are clearly visible, helping to identify the object as something akin to broccoli, despite its setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the broccoli/tree have a defined stem-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B features a stem-like structure at its base. This structure is consistent with either broccoli or a tree trunk. It provides support and connects the floret-like portion to the ground, which is a recognizable feature of both broccoli and tree-like forms.",
