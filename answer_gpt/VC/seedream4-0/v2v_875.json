      "question": "Is the brown, segmented, textured trunk of the palm tree present with visible horizontal ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, when examining the palm tree's trunk, the visible cues indicate that it retains a brown, segmented texture characteristic of palm trees. The structure shows horizontal ridges consistent with palm trees' growth patterns as they shed older fronds. Such details are maintained in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the long, feathery green fronds forming a radial crown at the top of the palm tree present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the palm tree is shown with long, thin, and feathery fronds extending outward from a central point, forming a radial crown. This visual information aligns with what palm trees typically display, thus supporting the presence of long, feathery green fronds forming a radial crown.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are some of the palm frond tips visibly browned or dried?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On analyzing Image B, the palm fronds appear predominantly green, and despite common patterns seen in real palm trees, the tips do not visibly show significant browning or drying. This conclusion is drawn from the consistently green tones in the fronds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the palm tree positioned to the left of the cactus and taller than it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though there is an edited element (the cactus cartoon character and an outline of a photo), the original world configuration is retained, placing the palm tree on the left side of where the cactus would be. The palm tree also appears taller than the cactus character, maintaining the tree's visual hierarchy and positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the palm fronds primarily green in color, with some yellowing or browning at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm fronds are depicted primarily in a vibrant green tone. Upon examination, the edges do not show a significant amount of yellowing or browning; the color seems uniformly green. This reflects the probable intention to represent healthy foliage.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the palm tree maintain a tall, narrow trunk with a broad, rounded crown of fronds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B affirms the palm tree's portrayal with a tall, slender trunk and a broad, rounded crown of fronds extending outwards. This portrayal is characteristic of many palm trees and is accurately preserved in Image B, aligning with a typical arborescent figure.",
