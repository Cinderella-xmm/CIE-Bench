    "Question": "Q1: Are both arms extended horizontally to the sides, forming a symmetrical T-shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure depicted is holding both arms out to the sides, but they do not form a symmetrical T-shape. The arms are slightly angled upwards and are not perfectly horizontal, as seen by the figure's wrists being higher than the shoulders. Through visual analysis, we understand that the composition conveys motion or dynamic positioning rather than strict symmetry.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the head tilted upward and slightly toward the left side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's posture suggests that the head is slightly tilted upward. However, based on the visual information, the head seems to be facing straight ahead rather than being angled to either side, as the lines and placement of the robe would suggest a forward-facing posture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the figure have a beard and hair covered by a hooded garment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure seems to have elements consistent with a hooded garment that covers the head. This is evident from the layered clothing above the shoulders and how it drapes around the neck and head area. Combined with background knowledge of similar artworks, this suggests a garment covering the hair. However, no beard is visible in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are both hands open with palms facing forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the position and details of the hands suggest openness and outward orientation. Both hands are visible, attached to extended arms, and appear with fingers spread, indicating open palms. The way the fingers are drawn supports this conclusion of openness and forward-facing posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the robe cover the entire body from shoulders to the base of the statue, with vertical folds running down the front?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe covers the figure entirely from the shoulders down. The design of the robe, however, is detailed with patterns and does not feature the vertical folds that are typical of a statue's drapery. Instead, it showcases intricate patterns on the garment, indicating a stylistic approach rather than straightforward folds.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the statue shown in a frontal pose, viewed from a low angle looking upward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the portrayal of the figure is more stylized and symbolic, as opposed to a realistic three-dimensional statue perspective from a low angle. The illustration seems to offer a dynamic side view of the figure amidst waves, suggesting a more artistic interpretation rather than a direct, frontal viewpoint from below.",
    "answer": "No"
