    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the black-and-white half-timbered gable ends visible and positioned at the top of the central and right-side sections of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top left illustration depicts a stylized version of half-timbered architecture, characterized by a black-and-white gable end. The existence of architectural details like these is suggested by the simplified depiction of a Tudor-style building facade. While Image A features an actual photo with a similar architectural style, this analysis is based solely on the stylized representation in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a black arched door located on the left side of the building, embedded within the brick wall below the window ledge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, particularly in the illustration at the bottom right, shows a stylized version of a black arched door. The design emphasizes key elements like the door shape and its position within the facade, which corresponds to what the question describes. This matches the feature from a real-world architectural perspective.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sign reading \"Leeds Parkway Hotel\" present beneath the entrance awning, aligned horizontally above the main doors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork does not depict any text or signage, such as 'Leeds Parkway Hotel', above the entrance awning. The absence of text is typical of stylized or artistic formats, which focus on visual design elements over precise detail representation, unlike Image A which provides a realistic view.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there rectangular planters with colorful flowers positioned along the base of the building, both in front of the black arched door and near the entrance steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts stylistic floral decorations around the architectural elements, but it lacks clear rectangular planters with colorful flowers as seen in Image A. The artistic render focuses more on overall aesthetic rather than specific object details like planters.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there multiple windows with white frames arranged in grid patterns, including dormer windows on the roof and a bay window on the right side of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations prominently show a grid pattern with white window frames, capturing the essence of numerous windows, although not explicitly as dormer or bay windows. The stylized approach emphasizes pattern and facade layout common in such architecture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the main entrance doors located centrally under the awning, consisting of two wooden doors with glass panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, especially in the top left card, represents the entrance as a stylized door under a red awning with no visible detail of glass panels. The artistic impression hints at central placement but does not provide realistic details like Image A's real-world depiction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the lower section of the building constructed from red brick, with an arched opening housing the black door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's stylized representation includes hints of a brick facade and an arched entry, particularly visible in the bottom right illustration. While it doesn't specify 'red brick', the use of colors and shapes signifies a brick construction theme.",
