        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe distinct handwritten notes on the calendar, such as 'Birthday,' 'Wedding,' and 'No work,' on the corresponding dates. These annotations are visibly clear against the structure of the calendar. By combining the visual evidence of the markings with common knowledge of how calendar notes are typically highlighted for reminders, I can confidently conclude that these notes are still present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the printed and handwritten texts on the calendar pages, including dates and annotations, appear clear and legible. Although there is a slight texture or aged appearance added to the calendar pages, the numbers, words, and notes are sufficiently distinct. Using visual clarity and typical readability standards for printed text, it is clear that the text is still legible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar grid, which organizes the date numbers into rows and columns, is visible and clearly maintains the alignment necessary for a functional calendar. This implies that despite any stylistic changes or added texture, the structure of the calendar has not been disrupted, thus keeping the dates arranged in their intended grid formation. Such a structure is crucial for the calendar's usability and is confirmed present by the orderly layout.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the month labels like 'January,' 'April,' and 'October' are clearly visible and placed at the top of each corresponding calendar page. This presence of month headings is easily identifiable and appears consistent with standard calendar formatting, suggesting accuracy in placement and visibility.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I examine the numbers on the calendar, specifically looking for where numbers like '10,' '27,' and '12' are placed. These date numbers are correctly positioned in their respective grid locations, maintaining consistency with their original placement and ensuring their function in tracking days. Based on their clear visibility and proper arrangement in the grid system, the presence and positioning remain correct as required for effective date identification.",
