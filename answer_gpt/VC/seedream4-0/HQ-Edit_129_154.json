      "question": "Are the floral and foliate engraved patterns visible on the body of the transformed owl, arranged symmetrically between vertical ribs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl displays a body segment comprised of gears and other mechanical details, characteristic of steampunk designs. These do not resemble floral and foliate patterns arranged between vertical ribs commonly found on traditional teapots, as seen in Image A. Therefore, based on the analysis, the owl does not feature floral and foliate engraved patterns arranged symmetrically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the transformed owl retain a shiny, polished metallic surface consistent with the original teapot’s finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a mechanical owl with a shiny, polished metallic surface, similar to the finish of a luxury or antique teapot, such as the one in Image A. The polished metallic surfaces appear consistent in both images, indicating that the owl retains the shiny quality.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beak of the mechanical owl shaped like the original teapot’s curved spout, extending forward and slightly upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical owl's beak resembles a teapot spout extending forward and slightly upward, consistent with the design of the curved spout in Image A. This suggests that the owl's beak retains the teapot's spout shape and direction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail of the mechanical owl follow the same graceful C-shaped curve as the original teapot’s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the owl's tail having a graceful curve, resembling the C-shape characteristic of ornate teapot handles like in Image A. The tail follows a similar curve, indicating a consistency in shape between the two designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crown-like head of the mechanical owl include a pointed, tiered finial matching the original teapot’s lid top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl in Image B wears a crown with rounded tips rather than a pointed, tiered finial similar to the detailed top of a teapot's lid seen in Image A. The crown contains ornamental features but does not replicate the finial detail on the teapot's lid.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the body segments of the mechanical owl divided into vertical ribs, each housing a decorative motif, mirroring the original teapot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the owl composed of mechanical parts rather than defined vertical ribs with motifs as in Image A's teapot structure. The owl body has intricate mechanical designs rather than structured ribs with floral motifs, differentiating it from the original teapot.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ornamental scrollwork present at the base of the mechanical owl’s tail, corresponding to the original handle’s end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the end of the mechanical owl’s tail lacks ornamental scrollwork, contrary to any detailed designs at the end of a teapot handle seen in Image A. The design does not incorporate such decorative scrollwork at the tail base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tail of the mechanical owl rendered in a dark brown tone consistent with the original handle’s color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the mechanical owl in Image B is metallic and does not have the dark brown tone as the handle in Image A. The handle of the teapot is distinctly darker, indicating that the owl's tail is not consistent in color.",
