      "question": "Is there a single dark brown seed visible in the center of the apple's cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the figure replacing Luffy's head is an apple with a cross-section. In the middle of this fictional apple head, there appears to be a single, dark brown seed. This figure matches the appearance of a typical apple's core where seeds are usually found. The recognition that this is intended to be a novelty or humorous depiction of a person with an apple for a head doesn't affect the visibility or portrayal of the seed itself.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the appleâ€™s flesh show a dry, fibrous texture with visible vein-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple, serving as the head of the figurine, displays a dry and seemingly fibrous texture with visible patterns that resemble veins across its interior. This type of texture is indicative of an apple that has been left out for an extended period or undergone a specific drying process. The depiction is consistent with how an apple with a dehydrated interior would appear visually.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark brown stem attached to the top of the apple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the apple serving as the fictional head of the figure has a dark brown stem affixed to its top. This detail is common in apple depictions and indicates that the apple still has its natural stem intact, a typical feature observed in real apples.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the apple sliced vertically, exposing a symmetrical cross-section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple used as a head replacement for the figure is sliced vertically. With this cut, the apple displays a symmetrical view from the front. Such a slice is typically performed to reveal the core and any seeds inside, showing equal halves that often have symmetric attributes.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the apple placed on a flat, light gray, matte surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cartoon figure's apple head in front of its packaging on a light gray, matte surface which matches the typical texture and color of typical shooting backdrops. The surface appears sleek and even under the figure, creating a neutral setting against which the vivid colors of the figure and its packaging stand out.",
