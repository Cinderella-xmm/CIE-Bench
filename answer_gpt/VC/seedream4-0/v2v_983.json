    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tan and black fur color distribution, particularly the tan face and legs with black back, preserved in the creature’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has a predominantly tan body with black markings on the back, similar to the original dog's coloration in Image A. This indicates an intention to preserve the fur color distribution seen in Image A, where the dog has a tan face and legs with a black back. Such color patterns are common in dogs and are a key feature used to identify specific breeds or individual animals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floppy ears, with their rounded shape and downward angle, preserved in the creature’s head design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has ears that are rounded and angle downwards, consistent with the floppy ears of the dog in Image A. This shape is characteristic of many dog breeds and the illustration captures this detail to maintain the likeness of the original dog.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the open mouth with a visible pink tongue and exposed teeth preserved in the creature’s facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted with an open mouth and a visible pink tongue, but teeth are not visibly exposed. Comparing this to Image A, where the dog has an open mouth with a pink tongue and teeth showing, the pink tongue aspect is preserved while the visibility of the teeth is not.",

      "question": "Is the blue collar with a black buckle present on the creature, either as part of its design or reflected in the orb’s color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is illustrated wearing a blue collar with what appears to be a simplified black buckle, maintaining the design detail from Image A where the dog wears a clear blue collar. The resemblance is maintained to reflect the collar accurately in the creature's design.",

      "question": "Is the creature depicted in a lying-down pose with front paws extended forward, mirroring the dog’s original posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is shown standing with legs straight and not lying down, as opposed to the dog's lying down position with extended front paws in Image A. This indicates a different choice in posture for the illustration, diverging from the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B features dark eyes, a dark nose, and a tan muzzle, which are all characteristics present in the original dog from Image A. These features are common identifiers in many dogs and were preserved in the creature's design to retain familiarity.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the creature retain the medium-sized, muscular body proportions of the original dog, including a broad chest and defined back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is stylized and cartoonish, which inherently alters the perception of body proportions. However, it retains an adequately broad chest and defined back similar to a medium-sized, muscular dog, as seen in Image A. Although the representation is more simplified, the essence of the body's proportions is maintained.",
