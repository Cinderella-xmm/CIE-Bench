    "Question": "Q1: Are the wooden truss supports of the railway bridge clearly visible and structurally intact?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the railway bridge is transformed with neon lighting effects, which may obscure the view of the truss supports. The neon design introduces a futuristic look, and while the structure and shape of the bridge are maintained, the details, like wooden truss supports, are not clearly visible due to the lights. Using common sense, neon lighting generally obscures fine structural details. Thus, based on the visual alteration, it is difficult to see if they are visibly intact.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the river present and flowing continuously beneath the bridge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the river flowing beneath the bridge is visible with some of its surface showing reflections of the surrounding lighting effects, which are typical indications of water. A continuous flow is suggested by the uninterrupted illuminated effect on the water's surface. From the real-world understanding of how rivers are typically depicted, this indicates that the river appears to be present and flowing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red-brick buildings with gabled roofs and chimneys visible in the park area?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes a stylized view of the skyline, but the distinct red-brick buildings with gabled roofs and chimneys from Image A can still be identified amidst the neon enhancements, as they retain their shape and positioning. The visual transformation does not seem to fully obscure these structures, only adding neon elements around them. Utilizing knowledge of architectural features such as red-brick buildings typical in parks, these attributes can still be identified.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the green lawns and paved pathways in the park area clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the park is transformed with bright neon lines that trace paths and outlines of lawns. While the greenery itself is not prominently visible due to these alterations, the layouts of the areas where lawns and pathways should be are accentuated by the neon overlays. Common knowledge about park layouts helps in understanding that these neon elements follow the original paths and lawns, making them recognizable despite the stylistic changes.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the city skyline located behind the river and bridge, maintaining the original depth order?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the futuristic enhancements with neon lights on the buildings, their placement, and order relative to the bridge and river remain consistent with Image A. The city skyline continues to be positioned in the background, behind the river and bridge. Using depth perception knowledge, this order helps maintain the original depth and spatial arrangement despite the stylistic changes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are two parallel railroad tracks visible along the length of the bridge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge is depicted with added elements like neon lights, which significantly obscure the view and details of the railroad tracks. Although the general shape of the bridge is visible, no clear parallel lines representing tracks are apparent within this design. It's common for neon designs like this to obscure intricate details such as tracks beneath bright visual elements.",
    "answer": "No"
