    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there two female figures present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly two female figures depicted. This is identifiable by observing their form and attire, which are both discernible despite the artistic rendition. The placement of two distinct sets of hands and clothing further confirms their presence.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two figures positioned symmetrically relative to the central axis of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two female figures appear to be positioned symmetrically. This is inferred from their equidistant placement and the balanced portrayal on either side of the central structure in the background.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large central dome visible at the end of the pathway?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a distinct large central dome is visible in the background amidst the mosaic. This is inferred by identifying the recognizable features of a dome structure, which are present despite the artistic medium.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there an arched stone entrance framing the view of the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arched stone entrance is replaced by a mosaic-based arch within which other characters and elements are visible. The portrayal provides an artistic depiction rather than maintaining the original realistic depiction, which significantly changes the framing effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a straight water channel running from the foreground to the central structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the straight water channel seen in Image A is no longer distinctly visible, as the mosaic-style background has replaced the realistic path with artistic elements and symbols. There is no explicit depiction of a straight water channel in this version.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sarees retain a dominant red and gold color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sarees on the figures prominently feature red and gold, consistent with their depiction in a mosaic format. Despite being rendered in a different style, the color scheme remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are gold jewelry pieces, including a forehead ornament (maang tikka) and earrings, visible on both figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold jewelry such as forehead ornaments and earrings seems to be missing or not explicitly depicted, possibly due to the limitations of the mosaic style which sometimes simplifies or omits fine details like small jewelry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do both figures have long, dark hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both figures are shown with long, dark hair, noticeable through the mosaic representation where the depiction of the hair remains consistent in terms of color and length. The patterning of the mosaic replicates the look effectively.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
