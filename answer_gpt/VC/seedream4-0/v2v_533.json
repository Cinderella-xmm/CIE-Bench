      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar has a teal color, which is evident from its vibrant appearance.

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "By observing Image B, six tuning pegs are visible on the headstock of the guitar, suggesting no change in the number compared to a typical guitar setup. This matches the standard configuration for acoustic guitars. Therefore, the edited image still shows six tuning pegs.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the microphone is positioned to the right of the amplifier and guitar, signifying proximity to the guitar setup. The spatial relationship between the guitar and microphone remains unchanged. Therefore, the microphone is still positioned near the guitar in the edited image.",

        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the amplifier is positioned directly behind the guitar, maintaining the original setup's composition. The positioning indicates that the amplifier is still supporting the guitar at its rear side. Therefore, the amplifier is placed behind the guitar in the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar in Image B appears to be leaning against the amplifier without significant change in posture or angle, similar to Image A. This alignment suggests that the guitar maintains its original leaning posture against the amplifier in the edited image.",
