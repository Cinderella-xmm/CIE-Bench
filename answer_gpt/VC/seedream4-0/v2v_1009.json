      "question": "Are the carrot slices clearly circular in shape with visible concentric rings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot slices appear very clear and are distinctly circular in shape. The presence of concentric rings is common in carrot slices when they are neatly cut across the cross-section. The carrot slices in Image B display these characteristics with the typical orange pigmentation and the natural variation in tone that gives the impression of rings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cauliflower florets retain their natural branching structure and clustered bud formation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cauliflower florets maintain the expected natural branching structure, where each floret is a small cluster of tightly packed buds. This is consistent with the typical appearance of raw cauliflower, which is characterized by its white color and clustered form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all the carrots and cauliflower florets contained within the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, all visible carrot slices and cauliflower florets are clearly contained within the confines of the transparent glass bowl. None of the vegetables appear to extend beyond the rim of the bowl, indicating they are neatly contained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the arrangement of vegetables in the bowl natural and non-symmetrical, with both carrots and cauliflower present in similar quantities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the carrot slices and cauliflower florets appears natural rather than overly symmetrical. The vegetables are mixed in a way that suggests a typical casual placement that would occur when putting them into a bowl. Both carrots and cauliflower seem to be present in similar quantities, signifying a balanced distribution of the two types of vegetables.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the carrots distinctly orange and the cauliflower distinctly white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the carrot slices are a vibrant orange color typical of fresh carrots. Similarly, the cauliflower appears distinctly white, which is a characteristic color of this vegetable. These colors indicate that the vegetables have retained their natural coloration.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple distinct carrot slices and cauliflower florets visible in the bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly multiple carrot slices and cauliflower florets visible. The image shows a mix of these vegetables, making it possible to see multiple instances of both types within the bowl, confirming the presence of distinct pieces.",
