      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no horse visible at all. Instead, the image depicts a cartoonish construction worker character with a yellow hard hat and an orange safety vest. The setting appears to be a simple, animated construction site with rocks and a crane in the background. Therefore, the horse's brown coat and dark mane seen in Image A do not appear in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the horse depicted in a grazing posture in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is completely different and contains no animals. It features an animated character and elements of a construction site, with no visible presence of a horse in any posture. Therefore, the horse and its grazing posture depicted in Image A do not appear in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the sea and grassy shore in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an animated scene with no natural elements such as a sea or grassy shore. The background instead includes a simplified, stylized representation of construction-related items like a crane and rocks. Therefore, the sea and grassy shore from Image A do not appear in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white house visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of any buildings or houses. The background consists of a construction crane, contributing to the animated and thematic setting of a construction site rather than an image of nature with a white house. Thus, the white house from Image A does not appear in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Does the sea appear calm in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B completely lacks any representation of the sea. Instead, the background is dominated by components related to a construction environment, such as a crane. As there is no depiction of a sea, the question of its calmness is not applicable. Thus, the calm sea from Image A does not appear in Image B.",
