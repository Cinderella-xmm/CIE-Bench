        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that the character's face is blurred, it is impossible to determine any specific eye color from Image B. Therefore, there is no direct visual evidence to support any particular eye color.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face is obscured, making it impossible to ascertain details about skin tone and texture from Image B. Thus, it cannot be concluded whether these aspects are preserved.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's body, including proportions like the clothing and hands, stance, and overall attire, appears consistent and intact as evidenced by their posture and the staff-holding position, which matches a typical stance for similar characters in fantasy scenes.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
