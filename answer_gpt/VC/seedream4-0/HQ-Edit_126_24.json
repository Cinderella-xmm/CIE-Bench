    {

      "question": "Are the moss-covered rock formations along the stream clearly visible and preserved in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features glowing jellyfish and a fairy-like creature, which may cause distractions. Despite these new elements, the moss-covered rock formations along the stream appear to be maintained in their original positions and shapes, as evidenced by their consistent appearance compared to common natural scenes where such formations are stable over time.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mossy boulders arranged in the same sequence along the stream as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the arrangement of mossy boulders appears to be consistent with the original. While new elements are introduced, the underlying boulders retain their sequence, shown by the unchanged positioning along the stream when observing natural stream formation tendencies.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pink flowers located in the lower right corner of the image present and unchanged in color and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes additional glowing elements and changes the ambiance slightly but the pink flowers remain in the lower right corner without any alteration in color or position, as typical of such edits that preserve natural elements for coherence.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the light beams enter from the top center and spread downward in the same diagonal pattern as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the original and edited images show light beams entering from the top center with a diagonal spread. Despite added elements like glowing jellyfish and a fairy, the light pattern remains unchanged, maintaining its typical natural lighting path.",

      "question": "Are there hanging vines extending from the upper branches of trees, particularly near the central canopy area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images feature hanging vines extending from upper tree branches, especially near the central canopy. This natural feature is preserved amid edits, as vines are common in lush forest scenes and consistent design elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the stream follow the same curved path with multiple small waterfalls over mossy rocks as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the stream's path with small waterfalls over mossy rocks seems unchanged from the original. The introduction of fantastical elements alters the foreground perception but not the natural stream course.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the green moss texture consistently applied to tree trunks and ground surfaces in the same way as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the consistent application of green moss texture on tree trunks and grounds, aligning with the original image's portrayal of a lush and verdant forest landscape, suggested by untouched natural features.",
