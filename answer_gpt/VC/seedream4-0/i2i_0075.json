      "question": "Is the cat depicted with fluffy white fur that maintains its distinct texture and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is illustrated with fluffy white fur, which accurately follows common depictions of cats in cartoons or illustrations - generally focusing on overall coverage and volume rather than detailed texture. The fur is shown as well-defined, giving the impression of fluffiness but lacking finer texture details evident in Image A due to the illustration style which focuses more on broader strokes and less on intricate lines.",

      "question": "Does the illustration retain the cat's yellow-green eyes with visible pupils reflecting the original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the cat with bright yellow eyes, featuring small pupils set against the vibrant iris color, capturing the key visual characteristic of the cat's eyes seen in Image A. The illustration simplifies some details but maintains the essence of the cat's expressive gaze through similar color choice and pupil depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cat’s ears closely matches the color and shape seen in Image A. The inner ears are illustrated in pink, a typical color used to highlight this feature, maintaining consistency in color and proportion as seen in the original image, albeit in a simplified form suitable for illustrations.",

      "question": "Does the illustration preserve the cat’s relaxed posture with extended paws, consistent with its original positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B effectively retains the cat’s posture from Image A, with the illustration showing the cat lying down with its front paws extended. This relaxed pose is characteristic of cats lounging comfortably, and is preserved in the illustration, offering an accurate representation of the original's positioning despite the stylized depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration does not depict any floral pattern on the cushion. Instead, the cushion is rendered with broad strokes and lacks detail entirely. In Image A, the cushion pattern is evident with intricate designs, which are not translated into the simplified illustration style of Image B.",
