      "question": "Is the V-shaped dual-wing silhouette of the building preserved in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been transformed into part of a robot's structure. While the top of the building retains some original elements such as balconies and yellow awnings, it no longer has a distinct V-shaped dual-wing silhouette because its top is integrated into the robot, altering the original shape. In Image A, the original building has a pronounced V-shape at the top, distinguishing the two parts of the building. The transformation into a robot has obscured this feature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floors stacked in a consistent, repeating modular pattern from bottom to top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows that while some building elements like windows and balcony patterns remain, they are integrated into a robot, and therefore are no longer stacked in a consistent modular pattern as seen in a traditional building. Image A, however, shows a building with a consistent, repeating modular pattern typical in architecture.",

      "question": "Are the windows and balconies aligned horizontally on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a robot where the buildingâ€™s components like windows and balconies become irregular in positioning due to integration into mechanical joints and limbs. This disrupts the horizontal alignment typical of a building structure found in Image A, where the windows and balconies are aligned horizontally floor by floor.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the two wings of the building symmetrically positioned relative to the central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of the building into a robot structure results in an asymmetrical design. The robot's components don't maintain the originally symmetrical structure observed in Image A where the building's wings were more symmetrical relative to the central axis before the transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the yellow awnings present on the balconies in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation, some of the yellow awnings on the building sections are still visible and seem to be in similar positions as in the original Image A. Thus, the awnings have been retained even after the change in structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible separation between the window openings and the projecting balcony overhangs on each floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the building being converted into a robot, the typical separation seen in traditional architecture between window openings and balcony overhangs is not consistently visible. The new context intermingles elements with mechanical parts, losing that distinct architectural separation maintained in Image A.",
