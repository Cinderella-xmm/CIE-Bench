      "question": "Is the portrait of the gentleman contained within an oval shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrait is not restricted to an oval shape but appears on a larger rectangular canvas. There's no visible oval outline enclosing the portrait. Commonly, artists can choose either ovals or rectangles based on aesthetic preference. This implies the portrait isn't constrained to an oval shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, near the gentleman's neck, there's a visible accessory appearing as a cravat tied in a bow. This is identified through its typical ribbon-like structure and placement. Cravats were a common neckwear style, known for projecting elegance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman exhibits dark hair with sideburns extending from the temples down his profile. However, there's no visible mustache on the gentleman. The sideburns and hairstyle are prominent, yet no facial hair is evident on the upper lip.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a visual of the gentleman with a coat draping over his shoulders and upper back, which is noticeable through the dark fabric overlaying the profile's shoulder lines. Such garments are typical outerwear choices for maintaining warmth and style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gentleman is shown in profile, making the nose and jawline prominent features along the left side (from his perspective). These facial features align consistently with common portraiture poses. However, this does not apply clearly without supplementary information due to the blurred area.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than being within a clear, distinct oval, the portrait itself is rendered without additional rectangular framing. The sketch's positioning on a flat background further shows no distinct boundaries of a frame encompassing an oval, setting it apart from common enclosed displays.",
