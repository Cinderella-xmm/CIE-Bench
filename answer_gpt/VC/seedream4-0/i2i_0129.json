      "question": "Does the surfer maintain his original balancing posture on the manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is positioned on a wave, with a large manta ray added to the image. The surfer continues to balance on the surfboard, riding the wave, not on the manta ray itself. Therefore, his balancing posture on the surfboard is unchanged, and he is not balancing on the manta ray.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original wave formation preserved, with the surfer riding on top of it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the surfer is depicted riding on top of the wave. The wave formation in Image B is consistent with Image A, despite the addition of the manta ray. This suggests that the original wave formation is preserved.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ocean waters around the wave consistent with their appearance in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean waters in Image B, particularly the color and texture, closely resemble those in Image A. The presence of the manta ray does not alter the appearance of the ocean waters around the wave, maintaining consistency.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horizon line and clear sky from the original image retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a clear sky and horizon line, similar to Image A, meaning that these elements are retained. The addition of the manta ray does not affect the sky or horizon line, which remain unchanged.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of both images, the surfer in Image B continues to wear black swim shorts and remains shirtless, identical to his appearance in Image A. This indicates that his attire has not been altered in the edited image.",
