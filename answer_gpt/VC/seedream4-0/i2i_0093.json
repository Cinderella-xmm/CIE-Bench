      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the smartphone clearly maintains its regular rectangular shape with distinctive rounded edges, a common design trait for many modern smartphones.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the home button is distinctly visible at the bottom center of the phone's front face.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a charging cable clearly plugged into the bottom of the smartphone. The cable can be seen extending from the phone towards the side, implying a connection to a power source or charging pad, even though the exact connection to the pad cannot be directly seen.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phone is visually resting flat on top of the charging pad. This can be deduced from the alignment of the phone with the surface of the charging pad, indicating that it lies directly on it without a visible tilt or angle change, maintaining a level position.",
