        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railway tracks clearly extend forward from under the train and then curve gently to the right. This is evident as the illustrative style captures the perspective and layout of the tracks, reflecting a typical approach to represent depth and direction in art.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the typical warning sign shape and colors are visible near the track on the left side, indicating a triangular yellow warning sign with a blue border. However, a '50' speed limit sign is not present. The pop art style would emphasize such signs due to their standard colors and shapes, which are commonly represented in art for visual clarity.",
