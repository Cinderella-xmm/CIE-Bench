      "question": "Does the keychain retain the dog's original fur pattern with a mix of dark and light tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain depicting a dog reflects a similar pattern to the Yorkshire Terrier dog, with its head region being lighter (likely representing the light fur) and the body region being darker (likely representing the dark fur). This reflects a mix of dark and light tones similar to the original dog, preserving its characteristic fur pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chibi keychain oriented in a way that suggests it is looking toward the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the chibi keychain is in the palm of a hand and oriented straightforward, not situated in any scene, such as near the fire. This orientation does not imply it is looking toward anything in particular, especially not toward a fire.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is no dark rectangular pedestal present. The image solely contains a hand holding a chibi keychain of a dog with no similar object in the frame.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is primarily a light, neutral tone and lacks any of the darker, atmospheric, and sparkly qualities evident in Image A. There is no visual indication of a dark, moody setting or orange sparks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi keychain depiction of a dog with its ears perked up, similar in style to how the dog's ears are raised in Image A. Thus, this detail of the dog's appearance is preserved in the keychain form.",
