      "question": "Is the Great Wall depicted as a continuous, zigzagging structure following the contours of the mountain ridges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene within the snow globe presents a depiction of the Great Wall that follows a zigzag pattern, mimicking the natural contours of the mountains, which is consistent with how the actual Great Wall snakes around the landscape. This visual representation, along with the foreground showing an expansive view of the wall, strongly suggests continuity and a winding formation typical of the iconic structure.",

      "question": "Are the walls constructed with visible gray stone bricks and topped with crenellated battlements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B depicts a miniature version of the Great Wall, characterized by clearly defined brickwork that resembles gray stone bricks, with crenellated battlements on top. This is consistent with historical and architectural knowledge of the design features of the Great Wall.",

      "question": "Are there watchtowers visible at regular intervals along the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe in Image B, there is a prominent watchtower displayed at one point along the wall. The presence of this watchtower aligns with the traditional design of the Great Wall, which is punctuated by watchtowers at intervals to serve defensive purposes. In the context of the edited image, while the intervals may not appear extensive due to the small, ornamental nature of the depiction, the inclusion of a watchtower represents this aspect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trees surrounding the wall display bright autumn colors, including yellow, orange, and red foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction inside the snow globe in Image B shows trees encircling the Wall that display vibrant autumn colors, such as yellow, orange, and red. This is visually apparent as these colors contrast against the wall and make up the predominant hues in the design of the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a large, rounded rock formation embedded near the right side of the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any large, rounded rock formation near the wall. The contents of the snow globe are primarily the wall and autumn foliage, where unusual rock formations are not a feature. Hence, the absence of a rock formation in the new portrayal indicates that this variant lacks such geological features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small figures are visible on the Great Wall depicted within the snow globe. These figures appear to be walking along the wall and are somewhat ascending, which aligns with the dynamic portrayal of tourists in movement that one would expect in such a scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe representation in Image B includes stone steps that appear to lead upward along the wall. These steps are a typical feature of the Great Wall, indicative of the need for navigation across varying elevations, even though they are miniaturized in this depiction.",
