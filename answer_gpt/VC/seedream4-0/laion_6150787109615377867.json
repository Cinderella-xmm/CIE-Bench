    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tabletop still circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop has an intricate design with gears and components, but the overall perimeter forms a circular shape. This can be deduced from the visible edge that is consistent with a circle, confirmed by circular patterns around the design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does a single vertical column extend from the center of the tabletop to the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a central column, but it is not a simple single vertical column. Instead, it is surrounded and integrated with multiple mechanical arms and components, giving the appearance of a more complex structure rather than a straightforward column.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base consist of five symmetrically arranged legs forming a star shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a complex mechanical base with gears and components. It does not have clearly defined legs that form a star shape, unlike a typical table that might have such a base design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small black rubber feet at the tip of each leg?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical structure is complex and does not have clearly visible legs, nor black rubber feet typical of standard table designs. The base is part of a mechanical arrangement with gears and pipes but not defined legs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the height of the central column approximately equal to the diameter of the tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the proportions in Image B, the central column, surrounded by its mechanical components, appears to be significantly shorter relative to the tabletop's diameter. The height of the central column is less than the tabletop's diameter.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the main body of the table still made of a shiny, silver-colored metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table appears to be constructed with a combination of metals, including copper and brass, giving it a steampunk aesthetic. The shiny silver appearance from Image A is replaced by these materials, which are not predominantly silver.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
