    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the intricate iron lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower present, including its characteristic crisscross pattern and open framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is contained within a glass dome and retains its intricate iron lattice structure, which is one of the most recognizable aspects of the tower's design. This pattern is characterized by crisscrossing beams and an open framework, which are visually evident even in the model form. The preservation of these details confirms the retention of this iconic design element.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the arched base of the Eiffel Tower visible, with a clear central passage beneath the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the Eiffel Tower within a snow globe-like glass dome. The arched base and central passage of the tower are visibly detailed, maintaining the architectural feature that allows viewing through to the opposite side, characteristic of the real structure.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spire and crown structure at the very top of the Eiffel Tower present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spire and crown structure, located at the top of the Eiffel Tower, is visible and clearly defined in Image B. The detailed craftsmanship in the model emphasizes these attributes, capturing the essence of the real tower's uppermost construction, which includes the antenna-like spire.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rows of lampposts and bare-branched trees symmetrically arranged along both sides of the central path leading to the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows lampposts and barren trees arranged symmetrically inside the glass dome, flanking both sides of the pathway leading to the Eiffel Tower. This arrangement reflects symmetry, enhancing visual depth and emphasizing the central path toward the tower, typical of planned garden or architectural designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there figures in the foreground positioned facing the Eiffel Tower, with some appearing to take photographs or observe it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground within the glass dome includes miniature figures proceeding toward the Eiffel Tower, observing or interacting with the environment rather than taking photographs, which is a typical activity when encountering the prominent structure in reality.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central pathway extend directly toward the Eiffel Tower, creating a strong linear perspective with convergence at the towerâ€™s base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a cobbled pathway that leads directly toward the Eiffel Tower within the constrained environment of a glass dome. This pathway, while limited by space, is designed to imply a linear perspective that converges at the base of the tower, suggesting a direct and culminating approach to the structure.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the ground fully covered in snow, with visible accumulation around the base of the tower and along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B beautifully captures a snowy scene encapsulated within a glass dome, with visible snow covering the ground, including accumulation along the pathway and around the base of the Eiffel Tower. These attributes contribute to the winter landscape aesthetic commonly seen in snow globes.",
