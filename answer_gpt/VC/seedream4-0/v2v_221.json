      "question": "Is the large black patch on the left shoulder of the cow present and clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is depicted as a cartoon-like character, often referred to as a 'chibi'. In this style, the markings may not replicate realistic cow patterns, and indeed, the typical black patch on the shoulder is not prominently visible as a realistic cow’s markings would be in Image A. Instead, the markings in Image B follow a more simplified pattern. Thus, the large black patch on the left shoulder as seen in Image A is not present in the same defined manner in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a continuous white stripe running down the center of the cow’s face from the forehead to the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a stylized representation where the cow does not have a traditional, continuous white stripe like a real cow might. The facial markings are cartoon-like and simplified, which does not include such a detailed stripe as would be seen in a real cow, like in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the cow’s horns curved upward and outward, with a light base and dark tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow’s horns are stylized and simplified. They are depicted as outwardly curved but do not show the same gradient from a light base to dark tips that are visible in Image A. The horns in the cartoon style are uniform in color, lacking the subtle color variation found in more realistic images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the television is shown with a speaker grille on the right side and a series of control knobs at the bottom. This depiction matches the detail of vintage televisions which typically feature such designs, akin to what is visible in Image A.",

      "question": "Are both front hooves of the cow positioned on top of the television screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both of the chibi cow's front hooves are placed on top of the television, demonstrating a pose typical of animated or cartoon figures where they interact playfully or dynamically with objects. This is different from the stance seen in Image A, where a realistic cow stands behind the television.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is consistent with a stylized green grassy field under a blue sky with clouds, echoing the natural outdoor setting found in Image A, albeit in a more animated and less detailed style. The stylization does not detract from the overall representation of such a scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow's nose is depicted with a cartoonish pink shade, lacking the natural variation and texturing visible in Image A. However, the style does not emphasize nostril detail in the same way as a realistic image would, opting instead for a simplistic representation typical in cartoon art.",
