      "question": "Does the bird retain its bright yellow plumage with orange accents on its wings and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird displays a bright yellow coloration. However, the visual cues suggest that there are no noticeable orange accents on its wings and tail; they appear uniformly yellow. Using world knowledge of birds with similar color patterns, bright yellow with orange accents would typically show more contrast. The analysis of Image B confirms the absence of these orange accents.",

      "question": "Is the bird depicted as perched, even if on a different surface like a balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is perched on a balcony railing. The bird's posture, with its body aligned horizontally and feet clamped onto the railing, indicates a typical perching behavior. This is consistent with how birds normally perch on various surfaces such as branches or artificial structures.",

      "question": "Does the bird still have an open beak showing a pink interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird with an open beak, revealing a pink interior. The open beak in birds generally indicates vocalization or breathing, and the pink coloring is consistent with the soft tissue often visible inside a bird's beak. As per the visual cues in Image B, this feature has been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the bird's feathers appears smooth and detailed, indicating a high level of clarity. Additionally, the bird’s eye retains its detailing, showcasing a clear distinction between the eye and the surrounding feathers. These visual characteristics suggest that both the feather texture and eye detail have been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts the bird on a railing with its claws wrapped around the surface, which is indicative of a perching position. This posture allows the bird to maintain balance, which is typical for birds when they are resting on narrow surfaces.",
