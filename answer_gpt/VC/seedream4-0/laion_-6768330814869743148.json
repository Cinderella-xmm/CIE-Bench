      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four wooden trays arranged in a 2x2 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trays are perceived to be part of a stylized or abstract design rather than literal wooden trays. They are depicted in a colorful and graphic manner, consistent with a more artistic representation and distinct from natural wood. This suggests that these are not represented as literal wooden trays.",
      "weight": 3,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries in the bottom-right tray appear to be round, without the distinctive shell shape typically associated with madeleines. Madeleines are usually known for their shell-like appearance which is not represented here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label 'Madeleine' is positioned near the bottom-right tray with round pastries, not shell-shaped. The design suggests an abstract style with simple shapes and forms, missing the characteristic shell shape for madeleines.",

    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'craster' is prominently displayed across each tray in a bold and stylized manner, resembling an artistic graphic rather than an engraving which would suggest a more realistic representation.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses stylized elements to represent the parchment paper with bold outlines, giving the impression of paper or paper-like material inside each tray through artistic interpretation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the pastries in the top-right tray retain their oval, slightly flattened shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries in the top-right tray are stylized to retain an oval and somewhat flattened appearance. Despite the abstract nature of the design, they resemble the described shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the pastries in the bottom-left tray in a stylized form that loosely resembles sliced loaf bread. The internal texture is indicated through color variations and lines, fitting an abstract representation of sliced bread texture.",
