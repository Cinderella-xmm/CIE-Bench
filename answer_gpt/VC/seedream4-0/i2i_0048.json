      "question": "Does the zebra retain its black-and-white stripe pattern without significant alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the zebra still has a stripe pattern, the material appears to have been altered to look metallic or reflective, which is a significant change from the typical natural appearance. From examining the visual cues, the zebra's surface reflects light in a way that resembles metal, not fur, indicating an alteration. In Image A, we can recognize the zebraâ€™s stripes as natural black-and-white without reflective qualities. Comparatively, the zebra in Image B has experienced significant visual changes in terms of texture and appearance, despite the stripes being present.",

      "question": "Is the zebra still in its original standing posture facing slightly towards the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the zebra maintains its original stance and posture, facing slightly to the right, which is evident by its body orientation and the direction of its head. This posture reflects common zebra behavior and positioning. Upon comparing with Image A, the stance matches, indicating no alteration in the posture between the two images.",

      "question": "Is the second zebra partially visible behind the first one, preserving its placement in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second zebra is partially visible behind the first zebra, located towards the right side of the frame. This visibility and placement maintain consistency with Image A, where the zebra's partial visibility is observed in a similar way. The main zebra's physical presence does not obstruct the behind zebra significantly in both images, preserving its placement.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a grassy savannah background with some scattered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a grassy savannah landscape, complemented by some scattered trees and vegetation. Utilizing general knowledge, these characteristics align with typical savannah environments. This scene is consistent with Image A, as the landscape's fundamental elements like grass and dispersed vegetation are present and unchanged.",

      "question": "Are the zebras' relative sizes, proportions, and perspectives maintained as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the relative size, proportions, and perspective of the zebras in the scene are consistent with natural expectations and appear unaltered when compared to Image A. The primary zebra maintains a proportionate size next to the second zebra, parallel to what is seen in Image A. The perspective also aligns with what one would expect based on their positioning in the frame.",
