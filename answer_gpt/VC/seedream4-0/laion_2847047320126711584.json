    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the donut-shaped object retaining a circular form with a central hole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are donut-shaped characters depicted with a circular form and central hole, suggesting they are modeled after traditional donuts known for this shape. The central hole is a common characteristic of donuts and helps maintain their iconic appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the donut retain its golden-brown baked color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts donut-shaped characters which illustrate a warm, golden-brown color typical of baked donuts. This color is tantamount to visual cues of freshly baked donut surfaces, indicating they are convincingly modeled after typical donut hues.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the surface of the donut covered in visible coarse granulated sugar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visually depict granulated sugar on the donut characters’ surfaces. Instead, the surface appears smooth and does not exhibit the characteristic texture granulated sugar would impart.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible individual sugar granules on the donut’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut-shaped characters do not display individual sugar granules on their surface. The portrayal lacks the detailed depiction of granules that would be visible if sugar were present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the donut’s body formed as a continuous ring with a central opening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows donut-shaped characters designed as continuous rings with central openings, reflecting the traditional donut structure. This consistent design aligns with typical donut construction recognized for a ring with an opening.",
