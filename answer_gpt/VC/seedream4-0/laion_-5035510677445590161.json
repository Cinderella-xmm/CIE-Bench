    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the long, curly, voluminous white beard present and extending down the front of the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visibly long, curly, and voluminous white beard that extends down the front of the chest. This is a prominent feature often associated with costumes of certain characters, adding to the visual portrayal and authenticity.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the thin-rimmed glasses worn on the face, positioned over the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the area where glasses would typically appear reveals no evidence of thin-rimmed glasses being worn. Often, glasses are worn over the eyes for functional or stylistic purposes, and there is a distinct absence of this feature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the right arm extended outward with the palm facing upward and fingers slightly spread?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right arm appears to be extended outward, but the palm is not facing upward; instead, it is facing forward. The fingers are also not slightly spread in the manner described, contradicting the position suggested in the question.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth curved upward in a smile and the eyes slightly crinkled at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the facial details such as the mouth and eyes are not discernable in Image B due to specifics not described here, it is impossible to confirm a smile or crinkling of the eyes at the corners.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the head turned slightly to the left side of the frame, facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the frame in Image B, the head appears to be positioned naturally without a distinct rotation to either side being overly discernible. It does maintain a forward-facing orientation, aligning with the composition of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the obscured nature of certain facial details, such as the nose, eyebrows, and cheeks, in Image B, these features are not clearly visible. Therefore, consistency with the original image cannot be established from the current observation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the fingers of the right hand splayed outward with natural spacing between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fingers of the right hand directed outward with a natural spacing. This splayed positioning is consistent with a gesture of acknowledgment or greeting, commonly observed during poses or interactions.",
