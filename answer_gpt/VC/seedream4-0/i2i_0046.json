      "question": "Is the skater captured mid-air while performing the trick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is seen suspended above the ground with a bent posture, and the skateboard is below him. Such characteristics indicate he is in the midst of executing a jump or trick. The distribution of shadows and body orientation suggest motion, typical of being mid-air during a skateboarding trick.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's hat has a distinct pattern with lines and shapes that resemble geometric designs. This reflects the typical fashion of hats with various patterns, and there's no indication that such a pattern has been removed or altered in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is depicted in a position beneath the skater, with its wheels and deck orientation suggesting it is in a flipping motion. The skater's posture and height above the skateboard further support the observation that the skateboard is indeed mid-flip below him.",
