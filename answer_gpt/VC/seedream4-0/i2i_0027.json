      "question": "Is the dog's pose still focused on the tennis ball, with the ball near its nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog appears as a chibi or cartoon-like figure, characterized by exaggerated cute features such as a large head and small body. The dog is lying prone, its expression and position emphasizing cuteness with rounded shapes. The ball is placed very close to the dog's nose, indicating that the focus is on the ball, similar to the behavior seen in real puppies. This suggests that the edited image is designed to maintain this focus, albeit in a stylized manner.",

      "question": "Does the tennis ball retain its green color with a pink stripe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball clearly retains its vibrant green color with a distinct pink stripe. The color scheme is similar to that typically found on novelty tennis balls, which are often used in visual media to depict playfulness. Despite being in an animated form, the ballâ€™s color remains consistent with real-world tennis balls used in such contexts.",

      "question": "Is the dog still depicted as observing or interacting with the tennis ball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B, depicted as a cartoon character, is directly facing the tennis ball, with a close proximity between the nose and the ball. This captures a moment of interaction, suggesting curiosity or playfulness, which is a common portrayal of dogs with items like tennis balls. This implies that the edited image retains the concept of interaction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dog's posture still reflect a prone, ball-focused position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although stylized, the dog is in a prone position, lying on its stomach with its front paws extended forward, closely oriented towards the tennis ball. This posture is typically associated with dogs lying down in a relaxed yet observant manner, particularly when engaged with an object of interest.",

      "question": "Is the texture of the tennis ball (felt-like surface) still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation of the tennis ball lacks the detailed felt texture seen on real tennis balls in reality and photographs like in Image A. The ball is smooth and simplified in design, which is characteristic of animated objects where textures are often omitted in favor of style.",
