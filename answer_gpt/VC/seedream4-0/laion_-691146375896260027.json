    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall bombe (curved, outward-bulging) silhouette of the commode preserved in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO version of the commode exhibits a shape that mimics the outward-bulging silhouette characteristic of a bombe style. Despite the limitations of using LEGO bricks, which naturally form more angular lines, the overall impression of curvature is achieved by the incremental arrangement of smaller elements, suggesting the bombe style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly two drawers stacked vertically on the front of the dresser, each framed by brass mounts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the LEGO version does display what appear to be two distinguishable sections that represent drawers, marked by the presence of brick outlines and colored bricks that mimic the brass mounts providing framing. This configuration aligns with the idea of stacked drawers visible from the front.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the herringbone and starburst marquetry pattern visible on the front of both drawers in the LEGO version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the LEGO structure attempts to mimic complex designs, the detailed marquetry patterns like herringbone and starburst are not distinctly visible due to the blocky nature of LEGO bricks, which lack the finesse necessary to render such intricate details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornate brass mounts with acanthus leaf scrolls present around the edges of both drawers and along the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO version (Image B), while there are brick formations colored in a way to suggest brass mounts, the elaborate acanthus leaf scroll designs cannot be accurately represented due to the limited form-making capability of LEGO bricks, which influences the detail and intricacy achievable.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the legs curve outward in a cabriole fashion and terminate in brass sabots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's leg construction uses LEGO pieces arranged to suggest the cabriole style, recognizable by a slight outward curve. However, the characteristic termination in brass sabots is mimicked by the color of the bricks rather than distinct detailed forms.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a scalloped apron below the drawers, following the curve of the bombe shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO depiction (Image B), the bottom part mimics the curve but lacks the nuanced scalloped detail because of the LEGO bricks' geometric nature; the semblance to a scalloped apron might exist, but distinct scalloping is not clearly defined.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the top surface rectangular and flush with the upper edge of the dresser body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a top surface composed of LEGO plates, creating a flat upper section that appears to be rectangular in shape and visually sits flush with the body of the dresser. This top surface representation aligns with conventional furniture design standards.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (brass mounts, marquetry, legs) symmetrically arranged on both sides of the dresser?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the LEGO version (Image B), the arrangement of colored bricks indicates an intent towards symmetry in the decorative elements including mounts and legs. However, the lack of detailing affects the overall symmetry perception, but within its limits, an effort for a symmetrical arrangement is discernible.",
