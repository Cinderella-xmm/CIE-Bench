      "question": "Does the owl retain its brown and white spotted feather pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's body features a consistent brown color with a white spot pattern on the chest, similar to what is typically seen on owls in illustrations and likely the same as Image A, assuming it represents a similar creature. This suggests that the feather pattern is indeed brown with white spots.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the owl's large yellow eyes and black beak present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The area where the owl's eyes and beak would typically be located has been blurred in Image B, making it impossible to visually confirm the presence of these features. However, based on the context of Image A, if the image is of a typical owl illustration, those features would likely have been present. Without a clear view, I must conclude that they cannot be confirmed in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the owl still wearing a graduation cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the owl still adorned with a graduation cap on its head, which is a common feature and symbolic of wisdom and learning often associated with owls in academic settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is visibly holding a rolled-up diploma tied with a yellow ribbon, which suggests that this accessory remains unchanged from the typical owl statues or illustrations often depicted reaching a scholarly achievement level.",
      "weight": 1,

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts three books stacked beneath the owl, consistent with educational or scholarly themes where books symbolize learning.",
