    "explanation": "In Image B, the new footwear presented has distinct patterns and colors. These patterns and colors are vibrant, with swirling designs that utilize a bold color palette. This echoes world knowledge in which such designs are often meant to visually stand out and can easily be associated with artistic or creative expressions similar to what is often seen in snow sports equipment.

    "Question": "Q2: Is the wooden texture of the original hockey sticks preserved in the new footwear design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the footwear exhibits a rich use of colors and patterns. However, there is no visible display of a wood grain texture or appearance.

    "Question": "Q3: Does the new footwear retain a recognizable shape or silhouette reminiscent of the original skis?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents footwear designs that incorporate tall boot structures attached to long, flat bases, reminiscent of ski boots. This shoe form is elongated and retains a similar vertical stance and length, which reflects a silhouette similar to skis. This derives from the practical need of ski boots paired with skis, which are long for stability on snow, as illustrated in Image A.",
