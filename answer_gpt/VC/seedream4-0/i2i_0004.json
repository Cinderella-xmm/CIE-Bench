      "question": "Does the image retain the man’s smiling expression and distinct facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image appears to have a blurred region where facial features would typically be, effectively removing any distinct features or expressions. Therefore, even without referring to the original image, it can be concluded that the distinct facial features and smiling expression are not present in the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hairstyle is portrayed as a stylized and exaggerated form typical of 'chibi' figures, which are often cartoonish and simplified. Although the general style of hair might be similar, the realism and detail of a hairstyle are not retained in this stylized representation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure is placed in front of a background that resembles a bookshelf, evidenced by the visible rows of books behind it. Thus, it can be concluded that the subject is indeed positioned near a bookshelf.",
