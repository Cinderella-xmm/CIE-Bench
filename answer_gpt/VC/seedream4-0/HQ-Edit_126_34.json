    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cabin’s roof clearly shaped as an A-frame with snow covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin's roof is distinctly shaped as an A-frame. This type of roof features two steeply sloped sides meeting at the top in the shape of the letter 'A,' which is clearly visible. The roof is also covered in snow, as indicated by the white layer over it. A-frame roofs are common in snowy regions due to their ability to shed snow easily, which supports the visual appearance observed.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a chimney located at the peak of the roof, from which smoke is rising?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a chimney positioned at the peak of the A-frame roof, which is a logical place for a chimney to maximize draft efficiency. Smoke is visibly rising from the chimney, indicated by the wispy lines trailing upwards, which is a natural consequence of a warm area inside the cabin being vented to the colder outside air.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three illuminated windows on the upper level and three on the lower level, including one central window on the ground floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the upper level has three illuminated windows; however, upon closer inspection, the lower level differs as it has three illuminated windows, but none in a central position. This differs from the statement in the question, which suggests a particular arrangement of windows.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin constructed from visible horizontal logs with chinking between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cabin with visible horizontal lines that suggest a form of log construction. However, due to the style and medium of the painting, individual logs and chinking are not distinctly visible. The painting’s impressionist approach obscures these details compared to how they would appear in a realistic image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, snow-covered evergreen fir trees surrounding the cabin on all sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are numerous tall, snow-covered trees depicted around the cabin. These trees appear to be evergreens, as indicated by their characteristic needle-like leaves which remain in place during winter. They are evenly distributed around the cabin, fitting the description of being 'surrounding.'",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there smoke visibly rising vertically from the chimney into the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, smoke can be seen rising from the chimney. However, it does not rise purely vertically due to the impressionist style of the image where the depiction may not be strictly realistic. Instead, it appears as a soft, upward trail, maintaining the general form of rising smoke.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there glowing string lights running along the edge of the roofline beneath the eaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of glowing string lights is inferred from the warmer, bright coloration along the eaves of the cabin. This gives the impression of decorative lighting, although the impressionist style does not explicitly delineate string lights as would be visible in a more detailed photo.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there small snow-covered shrubs positioned on either side of the front porch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows forms resembling shrubs positioned on both sides of what looks like the cabin's front porch area. They are depicted with bright, snow-like textures, indicating that they are snow-covered. The placement and appearance are consistent with small shrubs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is there a split-rail fence partially buried in snow in the foreground, extending to the left and right of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a structure resembling a fence is visible in the foreground. It appears to be covered partly with snow, suggested by the white highlights indicating accumulations. However, the artistic rendering does not clearly detail it as a split-rail fence, making it challenging to definitively categorize it as such based solely on the painting style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Are there visible snowflakes falling throughout the scene, particularly in the sky and around the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses brush strokes and a speckled texture which give the impression of snowflakes throughout the scene. The effect of falling snow is achieved through these painterly techniques, which contributes to the overall wintry atmosphere of the image.",
