        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cardinal dressed in an elaborate red gown, mimicking Victorian-style fashion rather than showing a predominantly red body and black facial mask typical of a cardinal's natural appearance. The dress hood covers most of the bird's head, leaving the beak exposed but showcasing a costume-like attire instead of bird feathers.",
