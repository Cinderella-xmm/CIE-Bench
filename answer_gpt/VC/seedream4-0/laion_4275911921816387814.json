    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the blade visibly curved in the same manner as in the original image, extending from the guard to a pointed tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade displays a distinct curve similar to traditional dagger designs, extending smoothly from the guard towards a tip that appears rounded rather than pointed. It suggests a soft and plush design without a sharp edge, yet it mimics the original curve. In Image A, the blade also curves but concludes in a clearly pointed tip intended for cutting or piercing. While the curve is consistent between both images, the tip's appearance differs, leading to concluding that the curves are similar but the tips differ.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hilt retain the segmented, block-like pattern along its length, similar to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hilt as being covered in a plush fabric, smooth and uniform without any segmented, block-like patterns. It presents a singular texture rather than segmented designs. In Image A, the original hilt visibly features a segmented pattern resembling ivory or similar durable material. The design inconsistency points to a lack of the block-like pattern in the edited Image B.",

    {

      "question": "Is the guard decorated with intricate floral and geometric patterns, matching the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a plush toy guard that lacks any intricate patterns, presenting a plain, soft design without decoration. In contrast, Image A displays an ornate guard characterized by detailed floral and geometric engravings. No such decorations appear in Image B's guard indicating the differences in design execution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blade covered with a dense black filigree pattern, matching the original in layout and coverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade is embroidered with dark patterns against a lighter, soft background, emulating the filigree design of the original. The layout appears inspired by the original settings, where Image A features a dense black pattern intricately wrought into the blade surface providing a clear resemblance in overall design despite being embroidered rather than engraved. The ornamentation layout is largely preserved; thus, the dense filigree pattern appears similar.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions between the hilt, guard, and blade preserved, with the blade being longer than the hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a similar proportion where the blade length exceeds that of the hilt, reflecting conventional dagger designs. When comparing Image A, the same proportionality exists where the blade stands out in length over the hilt, fulfilling the standard design of a dagger. Both images maintain this proportional relationship, supporting the preservation of proportions in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the blade end in a pointed tip, consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the blade finishing in a rounded tip associated with soft designs instead of pointed. It's characteristic of plush or toy representations lacking functional sharpness. Image A ends in a distinctly pointed tip conceived for function and realism. The transition from pointed sharpness to rounded softness results in a visible difference in the blade endings between the images.",

      "question": "Is the dagger positioned diagonally across the frame, from upper left to lower right, as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orientation of the dagger in Image B is identically positioned, diagonally spanning from the upper left corner towards the lower right. A similar diagonal alignment is visible in Image A, confirming consistent presentation across both images. This orientation remains unchanged between both images supporting the same diagonal alignment.",
