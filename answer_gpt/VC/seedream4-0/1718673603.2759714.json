      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the two-tiered roof with upward-curving eaves and ornamental ridge details preserved in the same structural outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure retains the architectural style seen in traditional East Asian designs with two tiers and upward-curving eaves. The outline appears consistent with traditional elements like ornamental ridge details, even though it is depicted in a stylized, stained-glass motif. This suggests the structural outline is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the large red moon positioned in the upper center of the sky and retaining its dominant red color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large red circular shape above the building, resembling the moon. Its position is central and at the top of the image, mirroring real moongazing views. The dominant red color is visually striking, which matches the motif drawn in Image A, confirming the positioning and color are retained.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there two red-colored trees symmetrically placed on the left and right sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two red trees are depicted flanking the building symmetrically, matching common landscape designs for aesthetics and balance. They are positioned similarly to how Image A also portrays red trees, confirming their symmetric placement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a reflective body of water in the foreground mirroring the building and moon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes what appears to be a highly stylized depiction of water in the foreground with reflections visible, suggesting a pond-like feature. The representation of reflections aligns with the way water would mirror objects and imagery above it, similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone steps descending from the building platform toward the pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, stylized steps are visible leading from the building downwards. Although rendered in a linear, geometric manner characteristic of stained glass art, their intended purpose as steps leading to a lower level like a pond is visually plausible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the windows on the building emitting a warm orange light, particularly on the upper and lower levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the building's windows as part of the multicolored stained glass pattern. There's no distinct emission of light or color from them, as they are incorporated into the overall design rather than depicted as glowing. This differs from the warm light emissions seen in Image A, indicating no specific warmth or lighting effect.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there low green shrubs and manicured plants surrounding the base of the building and pond?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape includes forms and lines suggesting carefully landscaped greenery, consistent with shrubs and low plants but rendered in subdued stained-glass colors. This depiction captures the essence of the environment initially shown in Image A, confirming their presence.",
