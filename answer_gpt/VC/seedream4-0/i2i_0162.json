      "question": "Does the mouse retain its brown, orange, and white fur pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is depicted with a distinct fur pattern composed of brown and orange tones along with white patches on its body. By observing the colors and patterns on the fur, one can conclude that these distinct characteristics are retained in the edited version. The repetitive portrayal of these colors and placement on the mouse suggests its consistent fur pattern, similar to many mice and rodents.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mouse's whiskers and large ears clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse's whiskers extend prominently from its muzzle, indicating a common trait in mice and rodents for sensing its environment. The ears are also visibly large and well-defined, emphasizing typical features found in mice. The clarity and emphasis on these facial features suggest that they are indeed prominent and accurately represented in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the food crumbs present on the floor near the mouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a number of scattered food crumbs on the floor around and in front of the mouse. This suggests that these crumbs are intentionally placed near the mouse, possibly to depict its natural behavior of foraging or snacking in such environments, which is a common scenario observed with house mice.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouse positioned near the crumbs and looking downward towards them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is captured in a posture that is directed towards the floor where the crumbs are located. Its head is angled downwards, and its eyes are directed towards the crumbs, which signifies its likely interest or intention to examine or consume them. This positioning is indicative of typical foraging behavior of mice.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the general kitchen setting with flooring and cabinets identifiable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close examination of Image B shows surrounding elements such as tiled flooring and the presence of wooden cabinets. These items are strongly associated with kitchen environments, suggesting that the mouse scene is set within this context. The furniture and layout evoke a standard residential kitchen, confirming that the setting is identifiable as such.",
