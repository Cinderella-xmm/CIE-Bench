      "question": "Is the lionâ€™s head medallion present at the center of the desk's front panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a large book resting on a desk, and there is no visible lion's head medallion on the front of the desk. Instead, the image features a thick book with golden text along the spine, quill, and ink bottle, with no visible medallion. Therefore, by analyzing the visual cues in Image B and understanding what a medallion typically looks like, one can conclude that the medallion is not present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the quill maintain its feather shape, even if stylized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a quill pen resting on a stand atop a book, which retains the traditional shape of a feather, characterized by a long stem and a series of barbs that give it a feather-like appearance. The quill appears properly stylized yet remains recognizable as a feather. By combining the visual with common knowledge about quill design, it's clear that its shape is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book depicted as open, showing two pages of aged, yellowed paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is closed with a parchment sheet on top, ink, and an inscribed letter but no open pages. Unlike a book that is open, showing both pages, this image features a sealed book with a leather cover. By focusing on the visual attributes and using inferential logic regarding open versus closed books, it is evident that the book is not open.",

      "question": "Does the desk retain its dark wood texture and finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The desk in Image B is not prominently visible. Instead, the focus is on the book with a dark leather finish. However, the visible top surface, like the area where the book rests, suggests a rich wooden or leather-like aesthetic consistent with luxurious interiors. Thus, from the details provided and visual inference about fine furniture material, the wood texture and finish of the desk is not a major focus so overall it doesn't disregard or confirm typical dark wood appearance.",

      "question": "Is the arched window with a grid of leaded glass panes visible behind the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible arched window. The background is filled with dark wood bookshelves and no indication of any windows. Thus, by assessing these visual elements and using general architectural knowledge about what such windows typically look like, one can determine that no window as described is visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are tall bookshelves with rows of leather-bound books visible to the left of the desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays tall bookshelves in the background filled with books that resemble traditional leather-bound designs, providing the old-world library aesthetic. This visual aligns with the described setup and confirms the bookshelves' presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette consists of warm tones with dark brown wood textures, cream-colored parchment, and the red tones of the book and rug, which align with luxurious library aesthetics. Without directly comparing, these colors are suggestive of a consistent tone with a classic, upscale library or study, aligning with the suggested description.",
