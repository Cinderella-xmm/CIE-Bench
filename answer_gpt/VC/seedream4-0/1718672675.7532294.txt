    "Question": "Q1: Are distinct horizontal sedimentary layers visible in the rock face of the cliff?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rock face of the cliff is part of a large, mythological figure. The surface of the rocks on this figure does not show distinct horizontal sedimentary layers but looks more like a constructed or carved texture with some runes inscribed in it. This suggests it does not feature sedimentary layers but rather an artistic representation of a giant creature integrated into the cliff.",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are large, irregular boulders and grassy patches present in the foreground near the cliff edge?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground of the scene is occupied by the large figure rather than natural cliff formations with boulders and grassy patches.

    "Question": "Q7: Does the cliff edge form a steep, continuous drop-off directly into the water below?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cliff includes the large humanoid figure integrated into it. The cliff edge appears to be steep, but rather than a continuous natural drop-off into the water, it's more like a constructed drop-off as part of the figure's design. The nature of the cliff drop-off in this context is more artistic rather than naturally continuous.",
