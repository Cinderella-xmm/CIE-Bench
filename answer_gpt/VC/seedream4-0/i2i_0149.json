      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat has distinct dark stripes on its face and body, characteristic of a tabby pattern.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes appear to be a vibrant green color. The clarity and brightness of the eyes are distinct and dominant in the image, leading to the conclusion that the cat's eyes are vivid green. This is a common and natural eye color for cats.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur on the cat's chest and belly remains a white or very light color, contrasting with the darker tabby markings on in other parts of the body. This observation leads to the understanding that these areas are consistent with typical cat markings, indicating they are indeed white.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is lying down on a wooden surface with its front paws stretched out in front of it, displaying a relaxed demeanor. This visual cue, matched with the knowledge of how cats commonly rest, indicates that the cat is in a relaxed lying posture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the cat's fur appears detailed and sharp, with individual strands visible, which indicates good image quality. The lighting effects create realistic shadows and highlights on the cat's body and the wooden surface, suggesting that these elements have been preserved.",
