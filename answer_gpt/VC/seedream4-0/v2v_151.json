        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is depicted as a cute, cartoonish character with clear black stripes on its face and body against an orange background. These stripes are characteristic of a tiger's appearance in both real and stylized depictions. Common knowledge would indicate that whether stylized or realistic, the tiger's distinctive stripe pattern is often maintained to ensure recognizability. Therefore, the stripes are visible and indicative of a tiger.",

      "question": "Is the tiger still holding the skateboard in its paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi tiger character holding a skateboard with one paw, while standing on the ground. This analysis is based on the posture and interaction of the character with the skateboard, which is being held but not necessarily within direct grasp. The depiction suggests the character has a hold on the skateboard in a balanced way customary for cartoon illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard being held by the tiger displays a visible yin-yang symbol on its underside. The yin-yang symbol is prominently displayed, indicating an intentional choice in both images to include this recognizable motif. The presence of the symbol in both images aligns with the retained thematic element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tiger wearing a military-style cap, similar in design to the one in Image A. The cap features a prominent star emblem and an olive green color. The choice of maintaining this accessory suggests consistency in the tiger character's attire, showcasing a themed or uniform look across different representations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is shown standing rather than seated, contrasting Image A's depiction of a seated tiger. Based on world knowledge about cartoon styles, characters are often depicted in dynamic, engaging poses rather than static or seated ones, supporting an active setting like skateboarding. The pose indicates a shift in posture rendering the tiger more lively and interactive in its environment.",
