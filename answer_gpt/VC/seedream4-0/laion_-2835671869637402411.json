      "question": "Are the stone steps beneath the character present and textured with visible cracks and moss-like details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is indoors, and the character is sitting in a wooden rocking chair in a room, rather than on stone steps outdoors. There are no visible stone steps in the scene, nor are there cracks or moss-like details associated with stone surfaces. This contrasts with Image A, where the character is depicted sitting on stone steps outdoors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an indoor setting with brick walls and a warm, cozy atmosphere. There is no arched window with vertical iron bars visible in the background.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is indoors, with one section of the wall covered in ivy-like decorations. These do not resemble the dark, twisting vines with dried leaves seen outdoors in Image A. Image A features such vines and dried leaves, adding to the atmospheric, eerie feel.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no candies scattered around. The setting is a room with furniture and decorative items, rather than an outdoor area with candies scattered on stone steps, as seen in Image A. Image A supports the Halloween theme with candies scattered around.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seated upright in a rocking chair with her feet down and hands resting away from her chest. This contrasts with Image A, where the character is sitting cross-legged on stone steps with her hands positioned near her chest.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, objects such as a sewing kit and porcelain figurine are placed on the left side of the character, and an oil lamp is placed to the right of the character, consistent with the arrangement described.
