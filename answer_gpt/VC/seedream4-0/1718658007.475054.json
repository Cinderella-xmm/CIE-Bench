      "question": "Does the edited image show the octopus with exactly eight tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is depicted with numerous tentacles which loop and twist in various directions. Counting the tentacles visible in this illustration, there are indeed eight distinct tentacles shown prominently. This artistic portrayal emphasizes each tentacle, making it clear that there are eight. Given the cartoon-styled representation, attention to detail is apparent in emphasizing the traditional eight tentacles associated with octopuses.",

      "question": "Are there two distinct, large eyes visible on the octopus’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus features two large, distinct eyes on its head. This is a common trait in both artistic and realistic representations of octopuses, and in this art style, the eyes are exaggerated in size and clearly drawn to make the character appear lively and expressive.",

      "question": "Are suction cups visible along the underside of at least some of the octopus’s tentacles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a cartoon illustration, simplifies details to emphasize key features. The depiction of the octopus does include notable suction cups along the undersides of its tentacles. This choice is intentional to reference common depictions of octopuses and reinforce the identity of the creature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is shown to be on the shore, with its body placed both on the sand and extending into the ocean, suggesting a location right at the land-water interface. The illustration strongly implies that the octopus is positioned adjacent to the beach and in the water, capturing a sense of interaction with both environments.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is undeniably the largest figure in the composition, occupying a central position and oriented directly towards the viewer. This art choice establishes the octopus as the central focus and reinforces its significant role within this illustrated scene, as suggested by the promotional text above.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a sandy beach that meets the ocean water in the foreground. This is a common artistic device to establish a coastal setting, aiming to create a vibrant and inviting scene consistent with the image's theme of adventure and fun at a beachside location.",
