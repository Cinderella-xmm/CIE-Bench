    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the rectangular-framed glasses present on the subject's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears without any eyewear. The attire and context suggest a historical or artistic rendition where modern accessories like glasses are typically excluded. Even though the face is blurred, the absence of glasses is inferred from the style and theme of the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gray and white beard and mustache present on the subject's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the face being blurred in Image B, historical depictions often emphasize clothing and context rather than facial hair, especially when the primary image is focused on garments and accessories of the era. Thus, the presence of facial hair in Image B is not apparent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the graying hair visible on the top and sides of the subject's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is artistically depicted, with visible gray hair framing the head. The intricate detailing is consistent with Renaissance or Baroque portrait styles that feature elaborate hair.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a ring visible on the ring finger of the subject's left hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand of the subject is holding a sword, and no ring is visible on the ring finger. The positioning of the hand and the grip on the sword suggest that the presence of a ring would be noticeable if present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are painted with a natural color, and the proportions are consistent with realistic artistic styles that emphasize accuracy and detail. This aligns with historical paintings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the facial structure, including the nose, jawline, and eye spacing, consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As the face in Image B is blurred, specific facial features such as the nose, jawline, and eye spacing cannot be evaluated for consistency with Image A. The assessment focuses on attire and context rather than facial details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
