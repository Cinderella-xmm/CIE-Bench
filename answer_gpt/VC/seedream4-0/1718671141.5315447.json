    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a raised platform beneath the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the building, there appears to be a flat, elevated section, possibly a platform, which is typically used to support structures and create a foundation. Visual cues such as shadows and the architectural style suggest this elevation. Given the rounded, steampunk design with gears and pipes, platforms are common in such structures to provide stability and an aesthetic base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a still water surface directly in front of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the reflection of the building and surrounding elements is visible in a smooth water surface. The clarity and symmetry of the reflection are indicative of a pond or pool with minimal disturbances, suggesting still water.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the building have multiple horizontal tiers stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure in Image B displays several distinct layers, evident through visual indicators like varying elevations and separations marked by architectural elements. Each tier is visible and consistent with vertically stacked levels, commonly featured in steampunk designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the building positioned centrally above the water pool on a raised platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the building centrally located within the frame, elevated above a water pool. The positioning within the image aligns with the symmetrical reflection seen in the water, suggesting a central placement on a raised platform.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky dark blue with scattered stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a night sky in a dark blue hue, dotted with small white dots resembling stars. This is a typical depiction of a night-time scene, with a contrast between the sky and illuminated elements in the foreground.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there trees arranged symmetrically on both sides of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays trees placed evenly on each side of the building, providing a balanced view. The symmetry between the trees on these sides emphasizes the central positioning and complements the architectural design, often used for aesthetic harmony.",
