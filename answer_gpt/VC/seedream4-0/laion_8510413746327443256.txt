    "Question": "Q4: Are the ends of the band attached to the left and right sides of the watch case?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the band is designed as a dragon that seems to be integrated into and wrapped around the watch case, rather than being simply attached at the sides in the traditional sense. Therefore, it doesn't conform to the usual smartwatch design where bands are clearly attached at the left and right ends of the case.",

    "Question": "Q6: Does the watch case have a slim, compact profile with minimal depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch case appears to have a more elaborate design with a metallic dragon motif, indicating a bulkier profile compared to a slim, compact case. This suggests that the case does not have a minimal depth due to the additional ornamental features added.",

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there multiple adjustment holes along the length of the band?",
