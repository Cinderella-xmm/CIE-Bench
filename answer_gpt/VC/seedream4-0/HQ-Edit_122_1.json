      "question": "Is the vertical cluster of lavender-like flowers with fuzzy purple petals present in the same structural arrangement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a vertical cluster of lavender-like flowers, and these flowers have fuzzy purple petals. Comparing this with Image A, the structure of the flower cluster is consistent with the vertical arrangement in Image B. The structural arrangement in both images remains unchanged in terms of the vertical positioning and clustering of the flowers.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a single blue flower with a yellow center located at the top of the flower cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a single blue flower with a yellow center distinctly positioned towards the top of the lavender-like flowers. In Image A, there is also a similar blue flower with a yellow center at the top of the cluster. This indicates that both images feature the blue flower at the top of the flower cluster in the same position.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned with its legs touching the flower stem, maintaining physical contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entity resembling a butterfly is depicted with its legs visibly contacting the flower stem. This suggests physical contact is maintained. In Image A, the butterfly is similarly positioned with its legs touching the flower stem, indicating contact exists in both images.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wings of the butterfly fully spread in a side profile view, showing both left and right wings symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the creature, which appears to be a butterfly, are spread wide in a manner consistent with a side profile view, showing symmetry in the wings. Checking Image A, the butterfly's wings are also fully spread in a side profile view, displaying both left and right wings symmetrically.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting in the image coming from above, casting a warm golden glow over the butterfly and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to come from above, but instead of a warm golden glow, there is a cooler, softer light with a slightly magical or ethereal quality. Image A features a distinctly warmer, golden illumination evident across the butterfly and flowers. This contrast indicates that Image B does not have the same warm golden glow as Image A, although both have light coming from above, their temperature and effect differ.",
