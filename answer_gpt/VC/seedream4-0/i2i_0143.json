      "question": "Is the \"PARKING\" label clearly visible on the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter is photographed from an angle that shows the top section prominently, with the word 'PARKING' inscribed at the top. The light shining from behind may cause some glare, but not enough to impede the visibility of the label. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the label is clearly visible.",

      "question": "Does the sticker on the parking meter display the text \"ComsiAcara\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter contains a sticker with text on its face. Upon closely examining the textual content, the prominent red text appears to read 'ComsiAcara'. This indicates that the text 'ComsiAcara' is indeed displayed on the sticker.",

      "question": "Is the parking meter securely attached and standing upright on a pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the parking meter mounted vertically on a pole, suggesting it is securely attached in a typical urban setting. The shadow cast and the symmetric appearance further indicate that it is standing upright and in a stable manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parking meter in Image B appears to maintain a consistent design with what is commonly expected for such devices. It has not been stretched or compressed in a way that distorts its proportions. Thus, it retains its original size and structural proportions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting conditions suggest a strong backlight due to the sun being behind the meter, casting shadows forward. However, on close scrutiny, a distinct shadow of the parking meter is projected onto the ground area beneath it, indicating clear visibility of the shadow.",
