      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three triangular windows positioned at the apex of the A-frame roof clearly present and maintaining their triangular shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a futuristic glass structure, resembling a large multifaceted gem, rather than an A-frame roof construction seen in traditional log cabins. This design does not include the typical A-frame roof with triangular windows, as it is entirely composed of geometric glass facets without maintaining the traditional architectural features of the A-frame roof. Hence, the three triangular windows at the apex of an A-frame roof are not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cabin structured with a raised deck on the upper level and a garage on the lower level, maintaining the same vertical separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a gemstone-like structure set on a marble foundation without any recognizable elements of a cabin, such as a raised deck or a garage. The design is markedly different from a traditional cabin layout, lacking any vertical structural separation typically seen in conventional homes. Therefore, the structure does not maintain the same vertical separation as seen in a log cabin with a deck and garage.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the garage door located on the right side of the lower level, adjacent to the main entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a crystalline structure without elements resembling a garage or a traditional main entrance. The facets of this glass design do not include any signs of a garage door or conventional doors of any kind. Thus, there is no garage door available on the right side or any alignment with a main entrance.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cabin symmetric about its central vertical axis, with the roof peak, main entrance, and supporting columns aligned centrally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the traditional features of a cabin like a roof peak, main entrance, or supporting columns. It consists of complex geometric patterns with multiple glass angles and facets, providing a modern and asymmetric appearance. Consequently, there is no identifiable central vertical axis symmetry akin to a traditional cabin.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns beneath the deck present and positioned at regular intervals along the front facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no vertical support columns or a deck structure. The structure is a multifaceted glass installation on a marble base, with no recognizable aspects of a conventional building facade with support columns at regular intervals.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the small rectangular window located on the lower level, to the left of the main entrance, still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a futuristic, crystalline-glass structure distinct from the cabin's traditional form, lacking any characteristic elements like a main entrance or rectangular windows. The absence of lower-level rectangular windows suggests this feature is not present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the stone retaining wall made of large, irregular boulders visible on the right side of the cabin's base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass installation supported on a marble base with no sign of a stone retaining wall. It replaces natural and irregular boulders with a smooth, uniform marble platform, indicating the absence of any stone retaining wall.",
