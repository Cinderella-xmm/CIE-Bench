      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a necklace around the neck that closely resembles a choker, with its multi-layered structure apparent but lacks distinct dangling elements. The focus is on capturing the essence of the necklace in stone, though the detailing of dangling elements is less pronounced due to the medium of stone.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, a bracelet is seen on the right wrist, maintaining consistency with its presence and position as shown in Image A. The design might be simplified due to the medium's constraints, but the placement indicates an attempt to mirror the original setup.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, there is no obvious depiction of a ring on the index finger of the right hand as in Image A, where such accessories would typically be illustrated due to their delicacy being challenging to carve into stone.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a clear continuation of the wide, textured border along the pallu and hem of the saree, mimicking the rich border seen in Image A. The relief carving helps to preserve the look of the patterned border, which is a focal point in both representations.",
