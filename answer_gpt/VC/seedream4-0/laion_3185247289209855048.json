    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes green in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style and design of visuals make it difficult to determine any eye color. The illustration uses stylized cartoon-like representations often without specific detailing such as eye color. Therefore, there is no visual indication of the eyes being green.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lipstick applied in a rich red shade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area expected to show lipstick is obfuscated by the blur. Even if lipstick were visible, the art style may not render it in rich shades as seen in realistic depictions; the illustration style instead uses flatter, less nuanced color mapping typical of cartoons or comic art.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the subject looking upward and toward the upper left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary leftward tilt indicates the viewpoint is not significantly upward nor toward the frameâ€™s upper left, as the illustration lacks any eyes or directional markers to imply such a gaze.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the left shoulder bare and visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction maintains the visibility of a bare left shoulder, recognized from its location and skin tone consistency with the rest of the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a pinkish, textured material partially visible near the lower left edge of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, pinkish, textured material resembling fur is apparent near the lower left edge, consistent with stylized artistic elements often featured in caricature and anime art styles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there soft highlights on the cheekbones and jawline created by directional lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes cartoon elements that are less likely to display complex lighting effects like directional lighting causing highlights. The artwork style tends toward uniform illumination without realistic shading or directional lighting effects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the facial features symmetrically aligned with balanced spacing between the eyes, nose, and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the expected portrayal of facial symmetry and spacing is made challenging due to blur and cartoon style which eschews balanced visual components akin to realism, often taking liberty with symmetry.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
