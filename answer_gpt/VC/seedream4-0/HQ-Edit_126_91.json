    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the curved side profile of the grand piano preserved, maintaining its characteristic gentle arc and elongated form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano's side profile remains identical to a classical grand piano structure, maintaining its gentle arc and elongated nature. This matches world knowledge of how a grand piano typically looks, with its distinctive elegant curves.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the four tapered legs with decorative casters present and positioned beneath the piano body as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano is shown with only three legs visible due to the angle of the photograph, but all are tapered and appear to have decorative casters. This fits with world knowledge about grand pianos, which typically have three legs. The absence of a fourth visible leg does not indicate its absence; rather, it is likely obscured from view.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the piano positioned directly in the center of the corridor, aligned with the vanishing point created by the columns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano is not centered in the corridor; instead, it is placed towards the foreground with columns around it. This setup gives the impression of being in the foreground of a grand hall rather than aligned with a central vanishing point.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the floor composed of large square tiles arranged in a repeating pattern of alternating dark and light shades?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a marble floor with a predominantly white color and veins, typical of marble, without an alternating pattern. World knowledge about such luxurious interiors suggests that these floors do not adhere to a roughly alternating dark and light square pattern typical of ceramic tiles.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tall, evenly spaced white columns extending along both sides of the corridor, forming a symmetrical passage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indeed has tall white columns, but they are set within a grand hall rather than a confined corridor. They contribute to the spacious, symmetrical environment. World knowledge about architectural features in such luxurious settings points to this arrangement.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the piano retain a highly reflective, glossy black surface that mirrors the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano maintains a glossy black finish, characterized by its reflective surface. This is consistent with expectations of high-end grand pianos, which are often polished to a high sheen, reflecting their surroundings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are soft shadows cast beneath the piano and along the floor, consistent with overhead lighting from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast beneath and to the side of the piano appear soft and are consistent with overhead lighting, as is typical in well-lit indoor settings such as a grand hall with multiple light sources.",
