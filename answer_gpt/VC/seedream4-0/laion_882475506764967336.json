        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visually discernable are two chairs on each of the longer sides of the table and two benches (which can be considered as seats) on the shorter sides. This sums up to a total of six seats. By understanding how chairs and benches serve similar functions in seating arrangements, it's reasonable to conclude that six seating options surround the table.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two chairs on each longer side. However, instead of one chair on each shorter side, there is one bench per short side. Understanding the differentiation between chairs and benches is crucial, and in this arrangement, benches replace what might typically be a singular chair.",
