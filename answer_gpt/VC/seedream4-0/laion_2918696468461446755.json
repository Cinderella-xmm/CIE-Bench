      "question": "Is the mechanical eyepatch with visible screws and metallic surface present on the central characterâ€™s right eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the central character does not have any visible mechanical eyepatch on his right eye. His face appears to be obscured for privacy, and there is no indication of an eyepatch or any mechanical features visible on his right eye region. Thus, considering the visual cues provided, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is depicted holding an open book in his left hand only. His right hand appears to be performing another action, such as holding a magnifying glass. Therefore, based on the visual details, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the central character holds a book that appears to be a standard version rather than one with Chinese-style calligraphy. The book's cover has no distinguishable symbols or specific calligraphy typical of Chinese styles visible. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      "question": "Does the central character have short, straight black hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the central character's hairstyle cannot be clearly discerned due to the obscured face. However, based on other visual cues, such as the attire and context, he is wearing a hat which covers the hairstyle. Thus, it cannot be confirmed whether he has short, straight black hair. Therefore, the answer would be No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features several blurred figures standing behind the central character with no discernible colored hair. There are no visible individual features or distinctive hairstyles that signal white, purple, blue hair, or any colored eyes. Therefore, based on the edited image alone, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the central character's face is obscured in Image B for privacy reasons, the expression and gaze can't be evaluated or confirmed. Given the edited context, the visual evidence does not support identifying any specific facial expression or gaze direction. Hence, the answer is No.",
