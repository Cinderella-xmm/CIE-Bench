    "Question": "Q1: Is the dancer’s left leg extended vertically upward in a full arabesque, with the right foot en pointe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's design shows her left leg raised high and close to the vertical position, similar to a full arabesque. While her right leg appears supporting, characteristic of being en pointe. Comparing this with Image A, where the dancer’s position reflects the description accurately, the position in Image B matches this dance movement. Therefore, the analysis concludes that the posture described is maintained in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are both feet wearing pink pointe shoes with visible ribbons wrapped around the ankles?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the dancer with simplified cartoonish features, but the shoes are indicated as pink and feature artistic elements reminiscent of ribbons wrapping around the ankles. These designs align with the description, confirmed by Image A where there are pink pointe shoes with ribbons. Thus, the edited image retains the feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dancer’s hair styled into a tight, round bun at the top of her head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the triangular shapes suggest a stylized version of a tight, round bun, located at the top of the dancer's head. This geometric depiction signifies hair styled in such a manner. Observing Image A, the dancer's hair is indeed in a tight bun, corroborating that Image B maintains this styling in a stylized manner, making it distinct and recognizable.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dancer wear a sleeveless, fitted pink leotard paired with white tights?",
    "explanation": "The dancer in Image B is fashioned with shapes that suggest a sleeveless upper garment in shades of pink and closely fitting, paired with what could imply white tights, though stylistically presented. Viewing Image A, which presents these clothing attributes specifically, leads to the conclusion that the design in Image B conceptualizes the attire accordingly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is one arm extended forward and slightly out to the side, while the other grips the barre?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, both arms of the dancer are extended as per the stylized design, with one arm in a forward, outward manner, inferring an action away from gripping any barre. In Image A, one arm does grip the barre, contrasting the depiction in Image B which lacks such interaction making it evident.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the dancer facing to the right side of the image, with her body in a side profile view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted in a stylized side profile facing to the right, visible through the flow of body shapes and limb placement. Image A supports this view as it shows the dancer in the right side profile stance, affirming that the design in Image B visually retains this directional aspect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a visible seam running down the center back of the leotard?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a geometric style that abstracts surface details such as seams. The design focuses on shape without rendering internal garment lines, unlike Image A where a seam might be detailed. Hence, the edited illustration does not visually display a center seam, confirming its absence.",
    "answer": "No"
