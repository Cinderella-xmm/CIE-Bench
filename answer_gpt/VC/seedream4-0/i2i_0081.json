        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is centered above the sink, which matches typical bathroom design principles.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fixture visible is black, and the cabinet below the sink appears predominantly black, which is typical for modern minimalist designs. The contrast with the white sink is clear, enhancing the design's visual appeal.",
