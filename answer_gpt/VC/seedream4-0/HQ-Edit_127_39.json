      "question": "Is the four-legged base of the Eiffel Tower with a central archway present and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original structure and design of the Eiffel Tower have been replaced with a stylized figure that visually lacks the recognizable four-legged base and central archway of the actual Eiffel Tower. The design mimics a robe-like shape instead of the traditional structural elements of the Eiffel Tower. Thus, the iconic base and archway are not present or visible.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the classical-style building visible through the central arch of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original appearance of the Eiffel Tower in Image A features a classical-style building visible through its central archway. However, in Image B, the architectural design has been transformed significantly into a stylized figure which lacks an open central archway, instead displaying decorative and futuristic elements. Therefore, the classical-style building is not visible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the symmetrical rows of trimmed green hedges present along both sides of the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the symmetrical rows of trimmed green hedges along both sides of the foreground, similar to Image A, providing a consistent framing of the scene. These hedges remain symmetrically positioned in the edited version, contributing to the scene's layout continuity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there people visible sitting or walking on the grassy field in front of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy field in front of the stylized structure contains visible people either sitting or walking, akin to Image A. They are spread across the field, providing a sense of activity and similar positioning to the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the sky gradient transitioning from deep blue at the top to orange near the horizon present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the sky gradient from Image A, with a transition from deep blue at the top of the image to orange near the horizon. This gradient remains consistent across both images, enhancing the naturalistic setting despite the structural changes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the embedded lights illuminating the hedges visible as glowing spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows glowing spots embedded within the trimmed green hedges, similar to Image A. These lights provide illumination and create a visual accent along the hedges in both images, maintaining the nighttime depiction.",
