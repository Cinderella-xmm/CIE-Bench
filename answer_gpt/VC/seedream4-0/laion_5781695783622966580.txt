    "Question": "Q1: Is the hat still a wide-brimmed bucket hat with a broad, outward-facing brim?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hat no longer resembles a traditional bucket hat. It features an elaborate design with a geometric pattern and a more rigid structure, typical of an artistic or stylized hat rather than a simple bucket hat. A bucket hat typically has a soft, full brim that circles the head, whereas this hat has angular, structured lines and metallic elements, deviating from the bucket hat style.",
