      "question": "Is the subject seated upright with the back supported by a chair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject appears seated in a chair with an upright posture, as indicated by the alignment of the torso and head, which suggests an upright seating position. The visible structure of the chair and the positioning against the seated posture imply the back is supported. This understanding is based on the common seating posture where a chair supports the back, combined with the visual cues of a structured chair setting in the image.",

      "question": "Are the hands positioned together on the lap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are positioned separately, not together on the lap, as one hand is seen holding a quill while the other rests on the chair arm. Observing these visual cues and knowing that lap positioning typically involves both hands resting together when in such a posture, it is clear that the hands work within the context of writing or contemplating.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the head positioned directly above the torso and centered in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's head is directly aligned above the torso and appears to be centered with regard to the vertical axis of the image. This positioning creates a balance within the portrait frame, which is commonly employed in seated portraits for a proportional appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible armrest beneath the subjectâ€™s right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is clear that there is an armrest beneath the subject's right hand, as indicated by the hand resting on what appears to be the ornate armrest of a chair. Based on visual observation and common knowledge of chair design, the armrest is part of the support structure for sitting on chairs.",

      "question": "Are the arms bent at the elbows and resting along the sides of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's arms appear to be bent at the elbows, and while the left arm is resting along the side of the body, the right arm is extended forward to hold a quill. The positioning reflects an engaged posture, which often leads to variations in positioning, with arms extending rather than resting along the sides when writing or presenting.",

      "question": "Are the legs positioned symmetrically beneath the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are not readily visible due to the angle and clothing obscuring any clear view; however, given the seated posture and common sense assertion that seated positions typically mean legs are positioned symmetrically beneath the torso, one can assume symmetry without observable visual evidence.",
