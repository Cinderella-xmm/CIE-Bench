      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes are depicted in a cartoon style. The giraffes display patterns on their bodies that resemble the typical brown and white mesh-like arrangement seen on real giraffes, albeit in a simplified, stylized form. The cartoon art style often retains iconic features to keep elements recognizable, and these patterns are an important identifying feature of giraffes.",

      "question": "Are the ossicones present on the giraffes' heads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes, despite being cartoon versions, have ossicones depicted on their heads. Ossicones are the protruding horn-like structures on a giraffe's head, and cartoon adaptations usually retain such identifiable features to maintain the characterâ€™s identity and recognition. This helps establish the character as a giraffe to viewers, despite the stylization.",

      "question": "Are the giraffes positioned naturally relative to the grassy field and trees in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the cartoon giraffes relative to the background is appropriate within the context of a cartoon image. They stand on a grassy field with trees and rocks similar to a natural habitat, which helps evoke the typical environment where giraffes might be found. Even though the giraffes are cartoonish, their placement in relation to the background elements fits the scene logically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of grass, trees, and rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly contains grassy areas, trees, and rocks, consistent with depicting a natural setting or savanna-like environment. Despite being a stylized cartoon, the background elements are maintained to ensure the scene resembles a typical giraffe habitat, offering a complete and coherent theme consistent with the giraffes provided.",

      "question": "Does the general body structure of the giraffes, including their legs and torso, remain intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon giraffes maintain a body structure that is reminiscent of real giraffes, including their long necks, legs, and distinctive torso shape. The cartoon style often simplifies and exaggerates certain features for visual impact but usually retains the general proportions and recognizable body parts, ensuring that the overall structure is preserved for viewer recognition.",
