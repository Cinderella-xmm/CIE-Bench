    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure’s skin uniformly colored in a vivid blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skin of the figure is covered in a vivid blue tone with a glossy, liquid-like texture. The uniformity of the blue hue is visually consistent across the body and matches with a highly saturated blue appearance.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the banana rendered in a metallic gold color with a curved, elongated shape resembling a real banana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a banana, there is a geometric, golden polyhedral object being levitated. The shape does not resemble a banana, deviating significantly from the natural curves and elongation characteristic of a real banana.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, ears) clearly visible and anatomically recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where facial features would typically be visible is obscured and no distinct facial features like eyes, nose, mouth, or ears are discernible. Instead, a blue box covers the face.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand visible and positioned near the banana, suggesting a prior or ongoing interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s hand is visible and positioned near a geometric object, suggesting it is holding or supporting the object, implying an interaction despite the object not being a banana.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figure shown in a side profile with the head turned slightly forward, facing right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be in a side profile with the head directed slightly forward and facing towards the right, similar to the traditional posture often observed in portraits.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a background behind the figure, even if it is transformed or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a complex and dynamic background with swirling patterns and abstract colors, altering the spatial perception and indicating the presence of a warped or transformed background behind the figure.",
