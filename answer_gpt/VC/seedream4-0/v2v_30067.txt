    "Question": "Q2: Is the clock face located directly above the central arched opening?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the clock face is positioned directly above an arched opening. Standard structural designs often place decorative or functional elements like clock faces centrally above openings to maintain symmetry and balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the top of the tower feature a pointed gable with finials at each corner?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a tower top with a pointed gable. Finials are small decorative elements often found at the corners of gabled structures in architectural designs to enhance aesthetic appearance. This image includes such features at the corners of the gable.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there two arched windows on the left and right sides of the tower, positioned symmetrically below the clock face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be a single window on the left side below the clock face and visible damage where a second opening likely existed, indicating a lack of symmetrical windows based on the current state.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the undamaged stone surface of the tower uniformly light gray with visible cracks and rough texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows that the surface of the tower is indeed light gray and rough-textured, with visible cracks, suggesting signs of aging or wear, a common phenomenon in older stone structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there an intact arched opening directly above the clock face, forming a decorative frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, directly above the clock face, there is no intact arched opening, rather the area shows structural damage. An arched opening would typically be a continuous element, here it is incomplete due to wear and destruction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the tower maintain a tall, narrow vertical profile with distinct horizontal divisions at the base, middle, and top?",
    "explanation": "The tower in Image B maintains a slim vertical profile, and features distinct horizontal divisions visible at different segments, which help define architectural structural sections and break the profile aesthetically.",
