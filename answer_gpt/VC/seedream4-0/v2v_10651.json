      "question": "Is the diamond-cut pattern on the decanter preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decanter has been sculpted to appear as if made from clay. Despite this transformation, the diamond-cut pattern is still visually identifiable on the surface of the clay decanter. The preservation of this pattern indicates that the texture was an integral aspect that was intentionally retained, albeit through a different medium.",

      "question": "Is the white foam layer present on top of the liquid in the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object representing the glass is made of clay, and there is a white, foamy texture sculpted on the top, mimicking the appearance of foam on a beverage. This visual detail indicates the presence of a foam layer, akin to what is typically found in beverages like beer or ale.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are visible flames and glowing embers present in the fireplace in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background still shows the presence of flames and glowing embers within the fireplace context. The visual cues of light and color within the darker surroundings suggestively mimic a lit fireplace, despite the overall clay-based transformation of other foreground objects.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bottle opener shaped with a D-shaped opening and a long handle, matching its original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle opener is crafted in clay and maintains a similar silhouette and functionality-oriented design to that of the one in Image A. The shape does indeed feature a D-shaped opening and a long handle, thus preserving its original form.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the decanter positioned to the right of the glass, with the opener placed in front of both?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the spatial arrangement of objects remains unchanged from Image A. The decanter is positioned to the right of the glass, and the bottle opener is in front of these objects, indicating that the layout has been preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden table surface with visible grain texture present beneath the objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the objects appears to resemble a wooden table, complete with visible grain texture. This visual effect contributes to maintaining consistency in the setting, despite other changes in material textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the liquid level in the glass approximately near the rim, and in the decanter about halfway up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, despite the objects being represented in clay, the sculpted glass displays a liquid level close to the rim, and the decanter shows a level about halfway up, suggesting an intentional effort to replicate the original liquid levels.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the brick pattern surrounding the fireplace visible and intact in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains a semblance of the background from the original image, with a pattern suggestive of bricks still present around the area of the fireplace, indicating that the pattern has been preserved even through a material transformation.",
