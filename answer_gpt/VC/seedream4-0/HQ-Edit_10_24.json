        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's face is blurred, making it impossible to discern specific features such as an open mouth, red lips, or rosy cheeks. Therefore, we cannot visually confirm the state of her mouth or her facial features in relation to her blowing bubbles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
