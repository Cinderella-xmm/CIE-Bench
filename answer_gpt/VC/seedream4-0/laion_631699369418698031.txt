    "Question": "Q1: Are the two upward-curving horn-like protrusions still present on either side of the top face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the totem is encased in a glass dome, and despite the presence of blurred areas, two upward-curving horn-like protrusions can be discerned on either side of the blurred top face. These protrusions are part of the totem's design, typically representing horns or similar elements. Given this design feature, it's reasonable to conclude that they are still present in Image B even though the face is blurred.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the rectangular frame with horizontal grooves still positioned directly below the top face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, there is a noticeable rectangular structure with horizontal grooves positioned directly below the blurred top area, consistent with the typical design of such artifacts. This suggests continuity in the design structure from Image A to Image B, indicating that the feature is still present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a small circular carving located on the front of the middle figure's torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the totem is depicted under a glass dome with a butterfly perched on it. Upon examining the middle figure's torso area, a small circular carving is visible. This aligns with typical carvings that may represent symbolic or decorative elements on such totems. The presence of this feature indicates that it remains unchanged in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the diamond-patterned border still present around the lower edge of the totem?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, observing the lower part of the totem, there is a diamond-patterned border visible around the edge. This decorative feature is a common stylistic element in wooden statues or totems, and its presence indicates that it has not been altered or removed in the editing process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the natural wood grain texture clearly visible across the surface of the totem?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the wood grain texture of the totem is clearly visible, enhancing the realism of the object by showcasing fine lines and patterns typical of a wooden surface. This texture is essential for giving such artifacts a natural look, indicating that it is indeed present in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do all three faces have closed eyes and open mouths with visible teeth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite some blurred areas, the bottom and middle faces of the totem are clearly visible, and both have closed eyes and open mouths with visible teeth. Since the totem's design is generally consistent, it can be inferred that the top face, though blurred, likely retains this feature, implying design continuity across the faces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the bottom face larger than the middle face, which is larger than the top face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the size hierarchy of the faces can be observed where the bottom face is visually larger than the middle, which in turn appears larger than the top blurred face. This size differentiation among the faces is a typical design characteristic, suggesting that the size variation still holds in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
