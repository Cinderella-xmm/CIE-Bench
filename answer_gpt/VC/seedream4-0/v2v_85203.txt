    "Question": "Q1: Is the butterfly still positioned centrally in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central focus is not a butterfly but a swirling blue vortex with wings. The butterfly, as seen in Image A, is an actual insect positioned centrally. The change to a vortex instead of a butterfly indicates that the butterfly is no longer present or centrally positioned in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the butterfly retain its blue color theme, even if reinterpreted as energy?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a swirling blue vortex with wings made of energy. While this is not a literal butterfly, the energy vortex and the wings contribute to a blue theme, reminiscent of the blue color theme from the butterfly in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its general rugged shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, a simple dark silhouette is seen at the bottom. In Image B, the lower part of the image shows black, jagged, rocky formations. While not a direct match, the rugged, uneven characteristic remains similar in this new composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the butterfly still depicted as hovering above the dark silhouette?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a butterfly. Instead, a vortex is present above rocky formations. Since the butterfly itself is absent, it cannot be said to hover above anything.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the dark silhouette below the butterfly retain its dark color contrast with the butterfly?",
    "explanation": "Image A features a dark silhouette contrasting with the bright blue butterfly. In Image B, the rocky formations retain their dark coloring, contrasting with the bright blue vortex above, similar to the color contrast in Image A, albeit with different elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
