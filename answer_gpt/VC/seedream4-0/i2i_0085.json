      "question": "Is the painting still depicting orange-yellow trees along a river under a setting sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting features a natural scene with trees that have orange-yellow leaves situated next to a river, with the sun either rising or setting in the background. The visual elements such as the color of the trees, the body of water, and the sun are consistent with a sunset or sunrise, indicating this characteristic scene.

      "question": "Does the sofa still have beige cushions with a yellow accent pillow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa retains its beige-colored cushions, which are clearly visible and match the typical design of such furniture. Additionally, there is a distinct yellow accent pillow present among the other beige cushions. The identification of these colors is based on color theory and common interior design knowledge, matching the description in the question.",

      "question": "Is the sofa still positioned directly below the wall painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spatial arrangement in Image B shows the sofa directly underneath the wall painting. This is identifiable by observing the vertical alignment of the sofa and the painting, which remains consistent in their positioning. This spatial orientation confirms that nothing has changed in terms of the sofa's location relative to the painting.",

      "question": "Is the room still illuminated by natural light coming from the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light source appears to be coming from the right side, as indicated by the shadows and highlights, suggesting natural light from a window or opening. This lighting arrangement creates typical indoor illumination patterns, thereby confirming that the light source is indeed still on the right side.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flooring pattern visible in front of and under the sofa features a herringbone design, which consists of a classic chevron-like sequence of lines and materials. This pattern is identifiable by the characteristic zigzag layout. Given that this pattern continues to be present, the floor covering remains the same.",
