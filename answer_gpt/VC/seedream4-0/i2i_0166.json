      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is shown with bright yellow feathers which are striking and visually dominant. The beak is orange, contrasting distinctly with the yellow feathers.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eyes are clearly depicted as black, creating a contrast with its bright yellow feathers. The blackness in the eyes is a common feature seen in various bird species, where the eyes often appear darker due to the effects of lighting and the natural pigmentation known to highlight expressiveness and clarity.",

      "question": "Is the bird perched on a thin branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird perched on a branch that appears relatively thin, as it is not too thick compared to the size of the bird. This thinness can be gauged in proportion to the bird's body and is typical for small birds that perch on branches rather than thicker tree trunks. The depiction aligns with the common behavior and imagery of birds in natural settings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a blend of green hues, suggesting a natural environment such as foliage or a forest setting. Additionally, there is a visible bokeh effect, where the background is blurred with circular light patterns, a photographic technique often used to emphasize a subject while maintaining a hint of the natural backdrop. This approach commonly replicates the look of natural serenity and focus.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's feet are seen gripping the branch tightly, with its toes wrapped around the branch as birds commonly do to maintain balance and stability. This visible action shows the bird actively engaging with its environment, a typical posture in bird imagery and representations.",
