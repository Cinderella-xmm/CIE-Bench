      "question": "Does the image retain the brown and white pattern characteristic of a giraffe on the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls display a brown and white pattern, which resembles the characteristic spots of a giraffe. These spots are stylized but maintain the essence of a giraffe's distinctive coloring. The visual cues clearly show a repetition of spot-like designs on the surface of the dolls, which align with the common depiction of giraffe patterns known from world knowledge.",

      "question": "Are the ossicones visible on the heads of the nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the largest nesting doll at the left has two protrusions on its head, which are simplified and stylized representations of ossicones commonly found on giraffes. These features are rendered in a cartoonish style. Knowledge of giraffe anatomy supports the identification of these protrusions as intended ossicones.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have elongated necks resembling those of giraffes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the giraffe theme, the nesting dolls do not have elongated necks. They are shaped like traditional nesting dolls, which are typically cylindrical and do not feature prominent necks extending from the body. Visual inspection confirms that the dolls maintain the conventional nesting doll proportions without long necks.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending sizes on the wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a set of giraffe-themed nesting dolls arranged from left to right, starting with the largest doll on the left and decreasing in size towards the smallest on the right. This arrangement is typical for nesting dolls and visually confirms a sequential size order, supported by the obvious observation of their relative sizes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls have long legs resembling those of a giraffe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are depicted with short, simplistic caricatures of giraffe features and do not show prolonged limbs. The traditional form of the nesting dolls and the design style focuses on showcasing the giraffe pattern rather than anatomical accuracy, particularly the length of the legs.",
