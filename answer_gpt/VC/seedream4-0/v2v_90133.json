      "question": "Is the background a uniform beige color without any gradient, pattern, or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a beige color. There are no visible patterns or textures present, giving the impression of uniformity. The color seems consistent throughout with no noticeable gradient. Therefore, based on the visual cues in Image B and the assumption of a homogeneous background, the background can be considered a uniform beige.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the background have no visible texture, grain, or surface variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that lacks any noticeable texture or grain. The surface appears entirely smooth and uninterrupted. The absence of any visible texture or surface variation results in a flat appearance commonly associated with synthesized backgrounds for object displays. Thus, the background can be described as having no visible texture or grain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there no shadows, reflections, or light variations on the background surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is at least one distinct shadow visible beneath the object resembling a beetle, suggesting the presence of light interacting with the objects, thus creating shadows. This indicates variations in light distribution across the background surface, contradicting the assumption of no shadows or light variations.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the image framed with straight edges and no border or crop distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The framing of Image B appears to be straight-edged with no obvious signs of distortion or irregular borders. The photograph is clear and well-composed without any cropping artifacts or alterations affecting its rectangular shape. Thus, the image is framed with straight edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the background evenly distributed with no hotspots or directional shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting does not appear to be uniformly distributed due to the shadows cast by the beetle-like object, which suggests directional light. This creates areas with different light intensities, indicating hotspots and shadow presence. Consequently, the lighting cannot be described as evenly distributed.",
