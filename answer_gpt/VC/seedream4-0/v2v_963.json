      "question": "Are the sausages rendered in a reddish-brown color consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages held by the chibi figures are depicted with a reddish-brown color. This color choice aligns with the typical grilled sausage appearance, characterized by a cooked surface achieving a reddish-brown hue due to Maillard reaction during grilling. Thus, without needing to refer to Image A, the sausages in Image B indeed maintain this color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sausages display parallel dark grill marks along their length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages are held by chibi figures and do show dark grill marks running parallel along their length. These marks are a common result of grilling, showing where the sausage has come in contact with the grill bars. Such marks are typical of grilled sausages and add to their visual appeal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sausages exhibit a glossy, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the sausages in Image B appears glossy and reflective, which is typical of grilled sausages due to the oils and fats that often coat the surface, giving them a shiny appearance. This glossiness reflects the realism of grilled or roasted sausages.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly three sausages present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the three chibi figures is holding one sausage, amounting to a total of three sausages. This count can be readily observed by focusing on the sausages being held around the small depicted campfire.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is each sausage attached to a metal skewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sausage is indeed affixed to a stick-like object held by the chibi figures, depicting a skewer. This method of holding suggests the use of skewers or sticks to toast or grill sausages over a campfire, aligning with traditional campfire cooking methods.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sausages show slight bulging at their ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages do not show the pronounced bulging at the ends typical of sausages under intense heat. Instead, they exhibit a straighter form, likely due to the figurative representation within the model setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible reflective highlights on the upper surfaces of the sausages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sausages in Image B are portrayed with reflective highlights, implying they are glossy and reflecting light. Such highlights suggest the surface's sheen, as expected with oils or fats on grilled sausages catching the ambient light.",
