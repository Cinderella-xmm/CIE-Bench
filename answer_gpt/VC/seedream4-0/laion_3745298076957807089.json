    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bottle’s main body still a transparent rectangular glass container with softly rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe the bottle's main body, which is a glass container. The shape appears to be rectangular with visible curves at the edges, suggesting they are softly rounded. This is a common design for glass containers to provide an elegant appearance while retaining structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the interior of the bottle filled with a golden-yellow translucent liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the bottle does not contain a golden-yellow liquid. Instead, it holds a clear liquid and black reed sticks, indicating it is likely a diffuser rather than containing a scotch, thus there is no golden-yellow liquid inside.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black box with the arched cutout and gold text \"CADENHEAD'S\" at the top and \"ESTD. 1842\" at the bottom still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black box with an arched cutout is visible, and it still has the gold text at the top 'CADENHEAD'S' and at the bottom 'ESTD. 1842'. These elements appear consistent with the design seen in Image A, indicating that this box is present.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible reflections and highlights on the glass surface of the bottle indicating transparency and smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the bottle's glass surface has visible reflections and highlights. These are typically caused by light interacting with a smooth and transparent surface, such as glass, confirming the bottle's transparency and smoothness.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bottle positioned to the left of the box, with the box’s arched window aligned to frame the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is indeed positioned to the left of the box. The box is designed with an arched cutout that aligns well to frame the bottle, indicating careful placement to highlight the bottle within the cutout's space.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bottle have a flat, thickened base that rests stably on the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottom part of the bottle, which appears flat and slightly thickened, typical for a stable base on glass bottles. This design helps prevent tipping and ensures it rests stably on surfaces.",
