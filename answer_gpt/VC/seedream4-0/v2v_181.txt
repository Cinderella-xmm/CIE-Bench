    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the sheep's four-legged body structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is depicted as a cartoonish, festive character within a snow globe. It has a simplified, chibi-style design where the body is rounded and lacks distinct legs. Chibi-style representations often prioritize a cute, condensed look over anatomically accurate details, so the traditional four-legged structure isn't present. Instead, it features small, rounded forms for ease of depiction. Therefore, the body structure with four distinct legs is not retained in this design.",
