      "question": "Is the bite mark present on the right side of the pear-shaped animal, exposing white flesh with an irregular edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pear inside the glass cube has a visible bite mark on its right side, which is noticeable when taking the orientation of the pear into account. The bite reveals the white flesh of the pear, and the edges of this area are irregular. This is consistent with typical bite marks on fruit, where human teeth usually create an uneven edge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the interior surface of the glass cube display a visible wood grain pattern with a warm brown color matching the original wooden backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior surface of the glass cube does not show any visible wood grain pattern. Instead, it has a neutral, solid-colored background without a distinct pattern. The original image does not have a backdrop inside a cube but merely a wooden surface.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pear-shaped animal retain the small brown speckles across its outer surface, mimicking the original pear’s skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pear maintains the small brown speckles that are typical of the pear’s natural skin texture. This consistency in texture implies that the edited image preserved these speckles, which are also evident in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a brown stem present at the top of the pear-shaped animal, extending upward from the narrow end?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a brown stem prominently visible at the top of the pear within the glass cube, extending upwards from the narrow end, which matches the feature of a natural pear’s stem.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the pear-shaped animal maintain the classic teardrop silhouette with a narrow neck and broad base, matching the original pear’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in the glass cube is still a pear and retains its classic teardrop shape, with a narrow neck at the top broadening into a larger base, just as depicted in Image A. This silhouette is typical of pears.",
      "weight": 3,

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lighting tones in the edited image warm, with golden-brown highlights and soft shadows consistent with the original image’s color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting shows warm tones with golden-brown highlights, especially visible on the pear and its surroundings. The shadows are soft, and this color arrangement bears a strong resemblance to the lighting and shading seen in Image A, thereby maintaining a consistent color palette.",
