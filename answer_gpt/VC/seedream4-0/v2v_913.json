      "question": "Does the cake retain its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that the cake retains its two distinct layers of dark chocolate sponge, characterized by the visible separation between the layers, both having a similar textured appearance. Despite the character elements added, the cake's layers are intact. Analyzing the visual cues helps confirm that the structure of the cake has not been altered in these aspects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the top of the cake covered in a glossy, reflective chocolate glaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the cake's top is covered with a chocolate glaze that appears glossy and reflective from the shine evident on its surface. This shine is typically a result of the smooth, polished surface of chocolate, indicating that the glaze was applied in a manner to create a glossy finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there three visible streams of chocolate glaze dripping down the front face of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three streams of chocolate glaze are visible dripping down the front face of the cake. This observation matches common depictions of decadent chocolate cakes where the glaze slowly descends the sides, which is evident in the edited image despite the added artistic elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cake layers exhibit a dark brown, moist, and porous sponge texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible cake layers in Image B display a dark brown color, typical of chocolate sponge cakes, along with signs of a porous and moist texture, inferred from the slightly uneven and absorptive surface. These visual characteristics align with expectations for chocolate cakes and are present in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the cake placed on a white circular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is indeed placed on a white circular plate, as the character sits beside it on the same white plate. The visual cues are consistent with traditional cake presentation on a simple, white plate, keeping the focus on the cake itself.",

      "question": "Does the cake maintain its triangular cross-sectional shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that despite the artistic edits, the cake maintains its triangular cross-sectional shape. This is a typical shape for cakes cut from a round cake, and is evident in the depiction. The artistic customization has not altered the basic geometric structure of the cake.",
