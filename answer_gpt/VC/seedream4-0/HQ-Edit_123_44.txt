    "Question": "Q1: Is the U.S. national insignia (white star within a blue circle, flanked by red and white bars) present on the wings and fuselage of the aircraft?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft shown within a glass case has two visible stars with circular backgrounds on its wings and fuselage, which correspond to the design of U.S. national insignia used during WWII. This visual cue in the image aligns with the world knowledge of historical aircraft markings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there two radial engines mounted beneath the wings of the aircraft, one on each side?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the aircraft with two visible radial engines mounted beneath its wings, indicated by the rounded engine inlets and typical radial engine design. This aligns with common design choices for twin-engine aircraft.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does each engine have a three-bladed propeller attached to its front?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, each radial engine has a three-bladed propeller at its front, which is a typical setup for radial engines in aircraft, enhancing efficiency and speed. This observation is drawn from the visible propeller blades seen attached to the engine nacelles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy located at the front of the fuselage?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a rounded, transparent cockpit canopy at the front of the aircraft's fuselage, providing visibility for the pilots, which is a common feature in many aircraft designs, especially military ones.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the wings extend straight and symmetrically from the fuselage, forming a dihedral angle?",
    "explanation": "Image B reveals the wings extending straight and symmetrically from the fuselage without forming a dihedral angle. The wings appear horizontally aligned, which contradicts the concept of a dihedral angle where wings are slightly angled upwards.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the tail section composed of a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers with small fins at the ends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail section features a visible vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers on either side without small fins at their ends, showing a conventional tail design for aircraft, focusing on stability.",
    "answer": "No"
