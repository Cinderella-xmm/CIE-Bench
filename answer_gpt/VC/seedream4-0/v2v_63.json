        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the chibi dolls are wearing tops that are a dusty rose color, which is a muted pink shade commonly used in similar artworks. The consistency of this color with the original image suggests that this part of the color scheme hasn't changed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi dolls in Image B have brown-colored hair, which appears to be similar to the woman's hair color in Image A. The use of brown for the hair color in chibi representations typically reflects natural hair colors. This indicates consistency in this aspect.",
