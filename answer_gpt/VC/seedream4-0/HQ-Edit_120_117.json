      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a lighthouse is shown encased within a glass sphere. At the top of this lighthouse, there is a distinct red lantern room that features a domed roof and glass panesâ€”a typical design for lighthouse lantern rooms used to house the light component necessary for functional operation. Observing its details and recognizing lighthouse architecture, this matches the characteristic of a lantern room with a domed roof.",
