      "question": "Does the thermometer retain its circular shape and metallic rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is housed in a square metallic case, and while the internal dial retains a circular arrangement, the surrounding frame is not circular. This differs from common standalone circular thermometers which generally have a traditional rim without additional framing, which is the case in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the temperature scale markings (-2째C to 200째C) clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the temperature scale is marked from -2째C to 200째C, and the numbers are clearly legible around the circumference of the dial. The markings are distinct for easy reading, matching the typical presentation of thermometers, similar to Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the needle present and positioned correctly relative to the temperature scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a metallic needle mounted at the center, indicating a specific temperature on the scale, which is a standard feature of dials on thermometers. The needle's alignment is consistent with typical mechanical gauges, similar to how it is displayed in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'TEMPERATURE' is clearly labeled prominently across the midsection of the thermometer's face, ensuring that it is easily recognizable as a tool for measuring temperature, similar to its presentation in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the thermometer retain a white face for clear visibility of the markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a white background on the thermometer's face which provides high contrast for the black numbering and scale marks, maintaining clarity in visibility, akin to Image A which also has a white background.",
