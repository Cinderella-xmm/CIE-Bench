      "question": "Do the birds retain their original feather patterns including the brown and white colors and striated wing markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds exhibit brown and white colors with the same striated wing markings as observed in Image A. This can be concluded by visually analyzing the color distribution and patterns on the birds in Image B. There is no alteration to the birds' visual characteristics beyond the background, which suggests they retain their original feather patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the birds still perched on the branch with their beaks open as if singing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are depicted with their beaks open in a posture indicative of singing, and they are perched on the branch as in Image A. The position and posture of the birds are noticeably unchanged, indicating continuity in representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the branch is present and maintains the same visual structure and positioning as seen in Image A. The branch and its positioning relative to the birds have not been modified, despite changes in the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaves in Image B appear with similar shapes and positions to those seen in Image A. The visual characteristics of the leaves, such as their arrangement and form, have been preserved, suggesting no alteration other than the background change.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lighting effects on the birds highlight their forms, akin to Image A, despite a change in the background. The illumination seems consistent, enhancing the birds' features with a similar effect as from the original lighting conditions.",
