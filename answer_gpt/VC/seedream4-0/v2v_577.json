      "question": "Is the subject's hair dark brown and wavy in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the subject is represented as a LEGO figurine where the hair is dark in color and appears to have a wavy texture, similar to how LEGO pieces simulate wavy hair. The visual information from the LEGO construct suggests dark brown curly hair, which corresponds to such design elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO figurine in the edited image is wearing a light blue shirt, evident from the color of the clothing piece attached to the LEGO figure which depicts a similar style to the shirt seen in the original photo.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited LEGO image, the shirt is styled to resemble everyday clothing, but due to the limitations of LEGO figures, small details like a chest pocket may be omitted in the design, which is often lacking in such representations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the LEGO figurine's hands are near the laptop, and while typical positioning of LEGO figures allows hands to appear as if typing, this representation mimics an action of interacting with the keyboard.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO figure in the edited image is positioned facing forward towards the laptop, which usually signifies facing directly towards what they are interacting with, and standard LEGO articulation allows only limited pose changes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
