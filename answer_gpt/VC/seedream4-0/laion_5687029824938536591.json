      "question": "Is the triangular panel structure across the midfoot preserved in shape and spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the triangular panel structure across the midfoot is visible and maintains a similar shape and spatial arrangement as in typical trail running shoes or athletic footwear. The structure is composed of angular lines and geometrical shapes which provide support and stability, a common design in such shoes. When compared with Image A, the original image, the triangular panels indeed appear to be consistent in both shape and spatial arrangement. Such consistency is important for maintaining the shoe's integrity, irrespective of the material representation, which in Image B appears to be artistically rendered to mimic a wooden material.",

      "question": "Is the \"SPEEDCROSS\" text positioned along the lateral side of the shoe in the same location and orientation as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'SPEEDCROSS' text appears subtly engraved or carved into the wooden appearance of the shoe. It is aligned with the structure typically found on the lateral side of a shoe, albeit visually modified to resemble wood. In Image A, the 'SPEEDCROSS' text is prominently displayed on the lateral side of the original fabric-based shoe. The location and orientation in both images seem congruent despite the artistic transformation of material in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the Salomon logos present on both the heel counter and tongue tab in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the heel counter and tongue tab, it becomes apparent that the Salomon logos have been artistically integrated to maintain their original placement. The heel counter displays the Salomon branding similarly to Image A, where it features prominently. On the tongue tab, the logo is subtly represented in a carved manner in Image B, parallel to its printed presence in Image A. Despite the material difference, the logos maintain their relative position.",

      "question": "Is the lacing system maintained with the same number and spacing of eyelets as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a wooden aesthetic, with the lacing system represented with the same number and positioning of eyelets as commonly found in shoes like seen in Image A. Though visually carved and integrated into a wooden texture, the eyelets' arrangement in Image B reflects the practical design seen in Image A, ensuring functional similarity despite the transformation in appearance.",

      "question": "Is the outsole lug pattern and the \"contagrip\" text preserved in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outsole lug pattern exhibits rugged designs typical of trail-running shoes. Closely examining these features, they seem to align with what can be inferred as the 'contagrip' technology often associated with Salomon shoes, although visually transformed into a carved wooden texture. In Image A, the pattern and 'contagrip' text are prominent in the original outsoles. The preservation of this design in both form and placement indicates a faithful adaptation in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the reinforced toe cap shape and the embossed \"S\" logo preserved in the same location and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toe cap retains a reinforced appearance, with notable shaping similar to that of protective toe caps commonly integrated into durable footwear. An embossed 'S' logo is discernible, crafted into the wood-like surface. Image A also features a reinforced toe cap with an 'S' logo, prominent in design and utility for foot protection. The features remain intact in both location and form across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon close inspection, the 'LT LIGHT WEIGHT MIDSOLE' label is present near the heel region, albeit in a wooden rendition. This is consistent with the label's original format and placement in Image A, which illustrates the text near the heel counter in a straightforwardly visible manner. Though visually different due to material interpretation in Image B, the label retains its integral position and shape.",
