      "question": "Does the edited image retain the large ears and trunk shape of the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant character is shown with very large and prominent ears, which is a characteristic feature of elephants and is depicted as such in Image B. Additionally, the trunk is clearly visible, coming out from the center of the elephant's face. This is consistent with the typical features of an elephant, indicating that the edited image has retained these features.",

      "question": "Is the hat placed on top of the elephant's head and the collar around its neck in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant wearing a yellow hat that is placed squarely on its head. There's also a red and yellow collar around the top part of its body, resembling where a neck would be. This accessory placement is consistent with a traditional circus elephant's attire.",

      "question": "Are the eyes of the elephant black in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the elephant in Image B are shown as large black circles, typical of many plush or animated characters aiming for a cute aesthetic. This direct observation confirms the analysis.",

      "question": "Is the elephant facing forward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is oriented to face directly towards the viewer. This is evidenced by the symmetrical positioning of the facial features - two eyes, a trunk in the middle, and ears equally prominent on either side, suggesting a frontal view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of the elephant in Image B incorporates elements like a fluffy texture and soft features, distinguishing it from the blocky, angular style typical of constructions like Image A. The edited image's smoother, more rounded features do not mirror the sharp edges and block shapes from Image A.",
