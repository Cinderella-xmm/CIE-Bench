      "question": "Is the lime green body of the saree adorned with small golden diamond-shaped butis evenly distributed across the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the saree is made of a marble texture, representing a sculpture, which does not have any pattern or butis like those seen in textiles. Marble sculptures typically have a plain surface without additional embellishments like those on fabric. Therefore, the saree depicted on the statue in Image B does not have golden diamond-shaped butis.",

      "question": "Does the pallu feature a blue and gold striped pattern with repeating elephant motifs in gold zari?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a saree of a marble statue, which retains the marble’s natural white and gray veining. The depiction is not in color nor does the carving show intricate motifs like elephant patterns or zari work typically found in colorful textiles.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blouse royal blue with golden embroidered detailing along the neckline and sleeve edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse of the marble statue appears colored in blue stone or paint effect, which suggests a stylized color approach for the clothing. According to artistic conventions, it lacks any visible golden embroidery detailing along the neckline or sleeve edges due to the material and art style constraints.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a necklace with red and green stones positioned around the neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace around the statue's neck is visible and has red stone settings which mimic gems, but there are no green stones perceptible. This representation combines the appearance of precious jewelry with the limitations of material (e.g., marble-crafted might be painted for effect), and color suggests embellishment without green elements.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there earrings matching the necklace visible in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue features earrings that appear to be designed to match the necklace. However, due to the angle and the typical detailing of sculpture art, they are not distinctly visible beyond the indication of potential matching design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a golden bangle painted or sculpted onto the statue’s right wrist, aiming to represent traditional jewelry on this marble artwork, fulfilling a decorative role.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the statue is a single marble texture without any added embellishments like a bindi. Traditionally, sculptures do not exhibit such painted or carved marks unless specifically added in a painted statue, which is not evident here.",
