    "Question": "Q1: Is the white marking on the dog's snout and muzzle clearly visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a sculpted representation of a dog's head displayed in a museum exhibit. The sculpture features a distinct white marking that runs from the top of the snout down to the muzzle, which is consistent with traditional dog markings like the image label indicating an 'American Staffordshire Terrier'. This marking is prominently displayed and easily visible due to the sculpture's three-dimensional form and the effective lighting of the exhibit.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the dog still have a predominantly black coat with clear contrast against the white markings?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B uses color to differentiate parts of the dog's head. The predominant coloration of the sculpture is black with white markings on the snout and muzzle, providing a stark contrast between the dark and light areas. This contrast highlights the distinctive features of the dog's face, making the coloration of the coat visually clear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the dog depicted in a relaxed yet alert posture in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture captures a neutral yet attentive expression commonly associated with dogs that are relaxed but aware of their surroundings. The posture, although not a live animal, is reflected in the way the eyes and the orientation of the head are sculpted to give the impression of calm alertness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the dog's ears positioned naturally in relation to its head?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B depicts ears that are sculpted to sit naturally in relation to the head, positioned slightly forward as they do in many alert but relaxed dogs. The tile of the ears helps convey the intended expression and complements the rest of the sculpture's balanced proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the dog's eyes retain their reflective quality in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the sculpture do not have the natural reflective quality of a living dog. The reflective quality pertinent to a live dog's eyes is absent in the sculpture due to its material and static nature, which does not capture or reflect light in the same way living eyes do.",
    "answer": "No"
