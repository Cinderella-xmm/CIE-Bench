      "question": "Are the two prominent curved horns on top of the helmet still present and retaining their original shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the helmet with two prominent curved horns that appear consistent in shape and position with common depictions of armored helmets featuring horns. These structures are typically symmetrical and maintain their orientation, which matches how they would be positioned on the original armor. My assessment from visual cues combined with common helmet design knowledge confirms this similarity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the faceplate still skull-shaped with clearly visible, glowing red eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in the edited image show a blurred area on the faceplate location, making it impossible to determine specific details such as skull shape or glowing eyes. From this, combined with knowledge of faceplate design, I conclude that these features are not clearly visible, indicating they are not as described.",

      "question": "Do the shoulder pauldrons retain their large, spiked structure and the red vein-like patterns embedded within them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoulder pauldrons in the edited image showcase a large, spiked structure, with clearly visible red vein-like patterns reminiscent of organic design elements, often used to add texture and detail to armor. Observing these features and comparing them with traditional pauldrons, they match common characteristics used for dramatic effect in armor design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chest armor in the edited image clearly shows a segmented design with layered sections, enhanced by rivets and mechanical joints visible upon close inspection. These elements are typical of designs aiming to portray a robust, mechanical look while ensuring flexibility and articulation in armor pieces.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual information from the edited image indicates that the hands are equipped with clawed gauntlets, as evidenced by the sharp, pointed fingers clearly visible, which align with typical designs for armor gauntlets meant to enhance the visual impact and aggressive aesthetics of the figure.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the edited image shows a consistent weathered and scarred texture across the armor, including the chest, shoulders, and limbs, which is a common trait used to enhance the realism and aged appearance of armor. These textures are clearly visible, confirming they have been retained.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the figure in the edited image remains consistent with the proportions typical of armored figures, maintaining a proportional relationship between head, torso, and limbs. This alignment maintains the overall aesthetic and structural balance, confirming the original silhouette has been preserved.",
