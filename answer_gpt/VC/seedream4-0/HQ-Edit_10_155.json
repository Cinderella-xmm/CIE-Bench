        "Yes",
        "No"

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warm, diffused glow emanating from within the glass body of the lantern suggests a textured internal surface that resembles a honeycomb pattern. This texture is essential for dispersing the light evenly and creating a comforting ambiance. Therefore, the edited image retains this honeycomb-like internal texture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the lantern's finial is clearly depicted as having a tiered, domed design, culminating in a small loop at the top. This is consistent with traditional lantern designs where such finials are used for aesthetic and hanging purposes. Thus, the finial design remains unchanged in the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows the lantern emitting a warm glow from its interior, which contrasts with the colored glass designed to project the light outwardly in scattered, cultural patterns. This glow remains an integral aspect of the lantern's charm and functionality. Hence, the edited image does show this glow.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the lantern in Image B remains consistent, featuring the bulbous glass body seated upon a flared metal base that supports the truncated cone-like finial at the top.
