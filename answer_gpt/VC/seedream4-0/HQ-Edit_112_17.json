      "question": "Does the hammer retain its claw-shaped end and dual-headed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer is clearly visible and maintains its traditional form, including a claw-shaped end which is used for extracting nails, and a dual-headed structure for hammering. The claw end is clearly curved, fulfilling the typical shape. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge about hammers, allows me to conclude that the hammer retains these features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chisel retain its flat, rectangular blade with a beveled edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chisel is visible and maintains a distinct flat, rectangular shape indicative of chisel blades. The beveled edge is a typical characteristic of chisels for cutting or carving, which is also retained in Image B based on the visible blade edge. Based on visual observation combined with the common form of chisels, I conclude that the chisel retains its essential features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the file retain its long, straight, narrow shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the file visible next to the chisel is straight, elongated, and narrow, consistent with typical files used in woodworking or metalworking for smoothing surfaces. This shape and function aligns with the traditional form of files, allowing me to determine that it retains its shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tools positioned in the same relative arrangement as in the original image (e.g., hammer diagonal, chisel crossing file)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the tools are arranged with the hammer diagonally and the chisel crossing over the file. In Image B, the tools are arranged similarly: the hammer is placed diagonally across the frame, and the chisel crosses the file. Observing the arrangement and comparing both images reveals that the relative positioning is retained.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shavings retain their curled, ribbon-like shape and approximate distribution around the tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shavings are visible around the tools, with a pronounced curled, ribbon-like appearance similar to traditional wood shavings. In Image A, the shavings are also distributed around the tools, curling in a similar fashion. Comparing both images, the shavings in B retain their characteristic shape and distribution.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly five tools present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon counting the visible tools, there are indeed five distinct tools present, including the hammer, chisel, file, and other smaller tools. Image A also contains five tools, confirming that the number of tools is consistent between the images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wrench-like tool is visible and maintains an open-ended jaw, which is common for grasping nuts or bolts, coupled with a metal shaft shape. This design is consistent with typical wrenches, confirming that the tool retains its essential characteristics.",
