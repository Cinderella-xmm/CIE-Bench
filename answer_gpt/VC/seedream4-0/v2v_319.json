      "question": "Is the man wearing a dark navy blue suit with a white dress shirt and a striped tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a real person; it's an artistic toy representation set within a decorative box. The small character is not dressed in a suit but rather casual attire, commonly seen in miniature toy figures. Therefore, the description of a man in a suit does not apply here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ladder depicted is a toy-like miniature within a decorative box. Due to the artistic style, there are no visible detailed features like wood grain or joints; instead, it's a simplified representation made to fit the aesthetic of the box.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window in Image B is a representation within an ornamental box, styled to look like a real window yet part of a decorative motif. It does have a similar frame division but lacks realistic elements like reflections since it is made of non-reflective materials and is a decorative piece.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is a toy character within a themed box, not a realistic man in climbing posture. It shows the character at the base of a toy ladder, creating an imaginative scene, but not engaging in climbing activity as a real person would.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ladder is part of an artistry setup within a decorative box. It is positioned to create a scene of aspiration, leading upwards within the box, although not in the same realistic orientation as an actual ladder leading to a window.",

      "explanation": "Image B's window is part of a decorative motif; it does not have glass that reflects real surroundings. This window is part of the artistic design within the box, devoid of any actual reflective properties or scenic backgrounds.",
