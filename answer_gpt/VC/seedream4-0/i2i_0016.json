      "question": "Do both players retain identifiable clothing (white shirts and shorts, white tank top with black bottoms) and hairstyles in the chibi version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both chibi players wear outfits consistent with their original portrayal in Image A. The player on the left has a white shirt with dark shorts, while the player on the right wears a white tank top and dark skirt. Their hairstyles are also maintained, with the left player having her hair pulled back and the right player with a ponytail. Recognition of such fine details is achievable due to the iconic representation style of chibi illustrations, which simplifies and exaggerates key features.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the chibi players engaging in a handshake across the net, mirroring the original handshake pose seen in Image A. Despite stylization into chibi forms, the core gesture is maintained, evidencing the continuity of actions between the images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Regarding Image B, the net is maintained across the court, similar to Image A. While tennis balls are not distinctly visible as objects the players can access due to the stylization into chibi forms, their presence is hinted at in the background imagery above the court. This maintains the tennis-related theme introduced in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized background retains the tennis court's essential characteristics, such as court lines and fencing. These details clearly emulate the setting seen in Image A, demonstrating the scene of play is still an outdoor tennis environment in chibi form.",
