      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted in a seated pose, reminiscent of a human-like thinking position, with the left hand resting under its chin. This pose is iconic and often associated with deep thought.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gorilla have a prominent brow ridge, wide nose, and strong jawline consistent with a silverback gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a wooden sculpture rather than a realistic depiction of a gorilla, and the detailing is stylized. The features such as the brow ridge, nose, or jawline are not as pronounced or detailed like that of a realistic silverback gorilla but more abstract and smooth due to the nature of the wood carving.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden sculpture mimic the shape of a gorilla. Generally, silverback gorillas are characterized by a patch of silver or grey hair. However, the wooden figure does not represent distinct color variations due to its singular tonal wood material.",

    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden figure is placed on a carved horizontal surface that resembles a log or branch, which is intricately carved to simulate a natural setting, like a platform or log found in a gorilla's natural habitat.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's right arm is depicted in front and while the hand is resting on the same side knee, suggesting a non-standing pose typically seen with gorillas resting.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture does not capture specific gaze directions due to the stylized and abstract nature of the figure where the face details are blurred, and hence, expression or gaze is not discernible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements present in the background, even if stylized or etched?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
