    "Question": "Q1: Is the subject’s left leg raised and held behind her back with both hands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's left leg is depicted as raised up and held behind her back with only one hand, while the other hand is extended upward. World knowledge of yoga poses suggests that this could be a pose that involves stretching and balancing, commonly known as the dancer pose, which typically involves one hand holding the foot and the other raised. Therefore, the conclusion is based on the visual cues and understanding of common yoga practices.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the sun located directly behind the subject’s torso, forming a halo-like glow around her silhouette?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no sun depicted directly behind the subject's torso. The edited image features the subject as part of a book illustration with panels, and a consistent color tone throughout. World knowledge about halo effects indicates that direct bright lights, like the sun, create a glowing effect around objects or people positioned directly in front of them, which is absent in this illustration.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the beach surface visibly wet, showing reflections of the sun and ocean waves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beach surface is illustrated as part of a book's page without visible reflections or wetness effects. The sandy texture is consistent, and there is no visual cue indicating wetness or reflections of the ocean waves. Understanding common art styles, especially in illustrations, helps infer that the absence of detailed reflections or gloss may suggest dryness.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are there two distinct rocky landforms visible in the background, one on the left and one on the right side of the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a simplified illustration of a scene, with two distinct rocky landforms visible in the background—one on the left side and one on the right. Each is distinctly separated by the ocean. This can be inferred from the visual layout typical in simplistic artistic styles where key elements are often positioned for visual balance and narrative purposes.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the subject standing barefoot on the sand, with the sole of her right foot flat against the ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's right foot is depicted as flat against the ground, suggesting a barefoot stance on the sand, which is consistent with natural poses in yoga or beach-related activities. The illustration lacks detailed features of shoes, and common illustration norms show characters barefoot when standing on beaches unless otherwise emphasized.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is styled simply, showing an upward collection but not clearly in a neat bun at the back of her head.

    "Question": "Q7: Is the subject’s head tilted upward, with her face angled toward the sky?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s head is not tilted upward; instead, it is held straight, without any visual cues indicating her face is angled toward the sky. The illustration style and subject's posture suggest a balanced stance, which typically poses straight rather than tilted upward, emphasizing neutrality and poise.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q8: Are there visible ocean waves breaking along the shoreline in front of the subject?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shoreline lacks detailed wave action; it portrays a calm sea without visibly breaking ocean waves.
