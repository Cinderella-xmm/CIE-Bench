    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the hat still a wide-brimmed bucket hat with a broad, outward-facing brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat no longer resembles a traditional bucket hat. It features an elaborate design with a geometric pattern and a more rigid structure, typical of an artistic or stylized hat rather than a simple bucket hat. A bucket hat typically has a soft, full brim that circles the head, whereas this hat has angular, structured lines and metallic elements, deviating from the bucket hat style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth in their original positions and shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is heavily blurred, making it impossible to identify or determine the positions and shapes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Given the blur, no distinct facial features can be discerned.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hair retain its original light brown color and wavy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair remains consistent in both images. The color is a light brown, and it maintains a wavy texture, cascading over the shoulders in a similar fashion. The editing does not appear to affect the hair color or style, keeping it the same in Image B as it was in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the visible portion of the clothing a white sleeveless top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing remains unchanged from Image A. The visible portion of the outfit is indeed a white sleeveless top. The lighting and positioning emphasize the texture and color of the fabric, confirming its identity as a sleeveless top.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a solid white with no additional elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid white with no visible elements or embellishments. It serves as a neutral backdrop, highlighting the subject without any distractions or added details.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hat have a rounded crown with consistent height relative to the brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat in Image B features a more structured and ornate design with a geometric pattern. It deviates from the original rounded crown seen in Image A. The alterations introduce uneven elements to the crown and brim, such as shiny panels and decorative outlines, which vary the consistency relative to a traditional, rounded hat.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the lighting even and bright across the face and hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is well-distributed across the hat and face, enhancing the visibility of the details and maintaining an even brightness. The clarity of the hat's design showcases that lighting conditions continue to be conducive to highlighting the subject despite any edits made to the hat.",
