    "Question": "Q1: Is the angular, multi-tiered headdress with symmetrical side flaps present and unchanged in shape and position?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be a structure with a large digital screen is prominent, and there are no visible signs of any headdress or side flaps. The visual suggests a modern, flat, rectangular form, contrasting with an angular headdress. Thus, the headdress is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the eyes glowing amber in color and positioned symmetrically within the face?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a large screen with neon lights and emissions, lacking facial features like eyes. There is no evident facial construction resembling eyes or their glow in this screen display.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the stepped stone pedestal base present with distinct horizontal layers forming a pyramidal shape?",
    "explanation": "The pedestal base seen in Image A appears to be replaced by a futuristic foundation in Image B. The base supports a screen structure, which does not exhibit distinct horizontal stone layers, hence the curved and stepped stone pedestal isn't present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the segmented mechanical joints visible along the neck, beneath a translucent casing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a large screen replaces any mechanical or humanoid form, making it impossible to observe any neck features including segmented joints beneath a casing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the head oriented directly forward, facing the viewer without rotation or tilt?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a screen occupies the central composition, suggesting it faces forward, however this is not a traditional 'head,' so the question of orientation in terms of a face is non-applicable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the face symmetrically structured with aligned nose, lips, and jawline?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a geometric structure with screens instead of a face having nose, lips, or jawline, thus lacking symmetry that a traditional human face would have.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the head positioned directly atop the stepped pedestal, supported by it without floating or being detached?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a screen directly built upon a base structure, indicating it is anchored rather than floating, ensuring stability, although it does not resemble a traditional head or pedestal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
