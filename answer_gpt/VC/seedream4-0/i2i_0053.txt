    "Question": "Q2: Is the banana holder depicted with a curved metal arm supported by a wooden base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the banana holder is represented with a curved line suggesting a metal arm, typical in cartoon illustrations to represent metal surfaces. The lower part features a rounded shape with a different color and texture that suggests a base, likely intended to represent wood. This depiction aligns with the known design of banana holders which have a metal arm for hanging fruit and a wooden base for stability.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the bananas still rest naturally on the curved metal arm?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are positioned such that they appear suspended from the metal arm, maintaining the look that they are being held by it. Despite the stylistic change to a cartoon appearance, the arrangement mimics how bananas would naturally hang from such a holder.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the bananas shown in a bunch, connected at the top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas in the depiction are illustrated with their tops connected, consistent with how bananas grow and are commonly seen in a bunch. The simplified cartoon drawing keeps this detail, illustrating the concept of bananas as a connected bunch.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wooden base of the banana holder retain its wood-like texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the banana holder is depicted with a flat color without intricate textural details. While it retains its circular shape suggesting a wooden base, the texture is simplified and does not mimic a realistic wood texture due to the artistic style. Instead, it relies on color to imply material. This is a departure from the actual wood grain texture seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
