      "question": "Are the blue circular spots present on the serpent’s body, positioned as eyes or eye-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the serpent’s head, there are blue circular spots that are positioned and designed like eyes. The clear resemblance to eyes is based on the size, shape, and positioning on the head, which is typical for eye features in serpents or snake-like designs. Image A contains circular blue spots among beads, but the arrangement and context differ from eye positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the red and yellow colors form the primary scale patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the serpent with a body dominated by red and yellow colors forming the scales, creating a continuous pattern along the serpent’s body. These colors are prominent and clearly define the body of the serpent. Comparing with Image A, the beads mostly display red and yellow coloring, but in varied arrangements without a coherent pattern like scales.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black zigzag or spotted patterns visible as tribal markings on the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible black patterns on the serpent’s body appearing as tribal markings in a zigzag or segmented alignment enhancing the visual texture. This aligns with tribal or distinct pattern designs often seen on decorative items. Image A also presents black markings on beads, which are not distinctly tribal but highlight design intricacies.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the segments of the serpent’s body shaped like spheres or near-spheres, reflecting the original bead form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body does not display segments shaped like spheres or near-spheres; it is smoothly elongated resembling typical snake anatomy rather than segmented beads. In Image A, the beads are clearly spherical, distinct from the serpent’s continuous form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface of the serpent retain a matte, slightly uneven texture resembling hand-painted craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the serpent’s surface with fine details and a textured appearance suggestive of craftsmanship. The finish appears polished with hints of gloss rather than purely matte, indicating detailed design. Image A shows beads with a distinct hand-painted look, slightly uneven surfaces illustrating artisanal heritage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the colors red, yellow, blue, black, and white all present in the serpent’s body, maintaining the original palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body prominently displays red, yellow, blue, and black. However, white is not distinctly apparent in the serpent's design. Image A has all five colors noticeable across the beads. The absence of white in the serpent’s body composition alters the exact color replication.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the serpent’s body irregular and varied from segment to segment, matching the original bead diversity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents patterns that are consistent along the serpent’s frame forming uniform sections with little variation from segment to segment. Contrastingly, Image A showcases beads with irregular and varied patterns, each bead displaying unique designs, highlighting the diverse artisanal quality.",
