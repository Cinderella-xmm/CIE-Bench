      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vertical white \"Under Armour\" logo clearly visible on the outer side of the calf, maintaining its original font, spacing, and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is made from LEGO blocks which makes it hard to define detailed fonts and spacing precisely. The LEGO blocks attempt to recreate the patterns seen in a regular sock, but due to the constraints of LEGO as a medium, the clarity needed for specific fonts and spacing isn't achievable. Conversely, in Image A, the 'Under Armour' logo is clear with defined font and spacing. Thus, in Image B, while there is an attempt to replicate such elements, the clarity and precise detailing are not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there an orange tag with a black Under Armour logo located at the top edge of the sock cuff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an orange LEGO piece is visible at the top edge of the structure, which closely mimics the orange tag seen in Image A. While it is not possible to see intricate logo detailing on the LEGO piece, the use of a singular distinct orange piece implies its presence as a representation of the original tag and logo positioning.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the stylized \"UA\" logo present on the ankle section of the sock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B, constructed with LEGO blocks, does not demonstrate the presence of a clearly identifiable 'UA' logo at the ankle section. In Image A, the logo is clear and detailed on the sock. The blocky nature of the LEGO structure in Image B does not offer enough detail to display complex logo designs faithfully.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gray and white geometric patterns on the foot and shin area preserved in their original positions and color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pattern achieved with LEGO blocks tries to mimic the original design, with black, white, and gray blocks suggesting a similar geometric pattern to that of Image A. However, due to the blocky nature of LEGO pieces, exact shapes and colors might not be precisely the same, but the general representation is maintained with similar positioning and attempts at color scheming.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the gray reinforced sections on the heel and toe maintained in their original shape and location?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO representation in Image B uses white blocks where gray areas appear in Image A on the heel and toe. The position suggests an approximation of where the reinforced sections would sit, but the actual colors are not maintained due to the limited color palette of LEGO. The shapes are also blockier, though the general location is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the small text printed vertically along the lower leg of the sock still visible and in its original position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the medium used in Image B, which is LEGO, small text details cannot be rendered and are thus absent. Image A shows clear textual elements vertically printed on the sock, but this detail is not achievable with the LEGO construction shown in Image B.",
