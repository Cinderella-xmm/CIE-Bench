      "question": "Are the bright red flowers in the lower-left foreground still present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bright red flowers are clearly visible in the lower-left foreground as they appear prominently with vibrant colors in contrast to the surrounding green foliage. World knowledge confirms that these flowers are consistent with the natural vegetation typically seen around waterfalls. Comparing this with Image A also shows the red flowers in the same position; therefore, it is rational to conclude that the flowers remain present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the large green leaf in the bottom-right corner still visible and in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Careful observation of Image B indicates that the large green leaf is indeed visible in the bottom-right corner, retaining its lush appearance and precise positioning relative to the bottom corner, similar to its presence in Image A. The position and visibility of the leaf have not changed, supporting the conclusion it is still visible and in the same position.",

      "question": "Are the palm-like fronds with fan-shaped leaves visible on the right side of the waterfall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm-like fronds featuring fan-shaped leaves are distinctly visible on the right side of the central waterfall. These fronds visually fit the profile of tropical vegetation, contributing to the scene's natural framing. A comparison with Image A confirms their identical presence and positioning, so they are still visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the moss-covered rock formation visible at the top of the waterfall’s origin point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals the presence of a rock formation at the waterfall's origin point—marked by its texture consistent with moss-covered surfaces. This visual cue aligns with natural geological formations found in similar environments. Comparing with Image A shows a similar moss-covered rock formation at the waterfall's origin point, maintaining consistency, which confirms its visibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dense tropical vegetation on both sides of the waterfall still present and forming a natural frame around the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dense tropical vegetation is evident on both sides of the waterfall, creating a natural frame for the setting. This type of foliage is typical for tropical settings. When comparing Image B to Image A, the vegetation appears similar, confirming its continuous presence and framing function.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the pool area at the base of the waterfall still located in the same position, even if its appearance has changed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a visually distinct, possibly altered pool area at the base of the waterfall, noticeable by its location which remains unchanged compared to Image A. Regardless of the modifications manifested, the pool's fundamental positioning relative to the waterfall remains consistent, confirming the same position.",
