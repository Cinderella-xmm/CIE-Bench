      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fountain is positioned within the garden space and appears centrally to the viewer based on its alignment with the straight path leading towards the arched gateway. The garden layout's symmetry is emphasized by radiating flowerbeds and hedges converging around the fountain. Thus, it can be concluded that the fountain is centrally positioned within the garden setup.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garden layout features hedges and flowerbeds that are arranged in patterns that appear symmetrical. The visual symmetry is created by the balanced distribution of plants and hedges around the fountain, forming a radial pattern. Considering this layout arrangement and symmetry, it is reasonable to conclude that the pattern is indeed radial and centered on the fountain.",
