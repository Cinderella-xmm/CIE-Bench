      "question": "Does the edited image retain the detailed lacework at the collar and cuffs?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows a dress with lacework at the collar and cuffs that mimics the style seen in Image A. The lace detail is simplified but recognizable. Understanding the function and common appearance of lace in historical garments helps in recognizing its presence in both images, indicating an attempt to imitate the original design.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the puffed sleeves and fitted bodice design?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows puffed sleeves and a fitted bodice design similar to those in the original Image A. The exaggerated puffed sleeve is a common design in historical dresses, and both images preserve this characteristic. Upon comparison, the edited image seems to mimic the original design in terms of silhouette and sleeve structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image keep the full skirt flaring from the waist?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a full skirt that flares out from the waist, similar to the silhouette seen in Image A. Historical gowns often possess this style for added volume and visual impact, and comparison shows that both images exhibit the volume in the skirt that flares outward.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the floral pattern texture on the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is no indication of detailed floral texture similar to that in Image A. In Image A, the floral pattern is clear due to the visible textures on the dark fabric, which is absent in the edited chibi-style rendering in Image B. Knowledge of intricate fabric patterns helps identify this difference.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include the button closures down the front of the bodice?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does portray button closures down the front of the bodice, as seen in the simplified chibi rendering style. The presence of buttons in both images suggests the retention of key design elements from the original historical garment. Recognition of buttons as functional or decorative accents is facilitated by common knowledge of garment design.",
