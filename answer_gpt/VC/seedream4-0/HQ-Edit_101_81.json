      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the face is blurred, the position of the head and general body language—consistent with yoga practices—often implies relaxation and focus. Without seeing the eyes specifically, we infer from this posture that the likely intent is a focused, relaxed state.",
