    "Question": "Q1: Does the illustration retain the man's original face shape and glasses?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the illustrated version of the man. He appears with a blurred face but still shows a head shape that is consistent with wearing glasses. From the visual analysis, features such as glasses traditionally have a distinct shape and may appear in illustrations to add character continuity. Without the need for explicit viewing of Image A, common sense suggests that such distinct character elements would be maintained for consistency between real and illustrated versions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the pattern on the tie retained in the illustration?",

This suggests a purposeful choice to maintain specific clothing details to ensure character recognition between real and illustrated depictions.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the checkered pattern on the suit jacket retained in the illustration?",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the striped dress shirt visible and consistent beneath the suit in the illustration?",

Using logical reasoning based on consistent depiction conventions, the shirt remains visible and similar.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the short-cropped hairstyle retained in the man's illustrated appearance?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a continued line illustration representing what would be a short-cropped hairstyle. This matches the typical approach of maintaining character-specific traits like hairstyle in illustrations for continuity and recognizability. Since the hairstyle is generally a defining feature that carries over, it is reasonable to conclude that the short-cropped style is kept.",
