      "question": "Is the car still primarily golden in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is featured within a picture frame and maintains a metallic golden appearance. The use of a golden frame further highlights the prominence of this color. Common sense suggests that a significant change in color would have been noticed and would stand in contrast to the framing. Therefore, the car is still primarily golden.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
