      "question": "Is the white tea light candle present on the black surface to the left of the bonsai pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a white tea light candle visible on the black surface to the left of the base where the edited statue stands, similar to its position in Image A. The presence of the candle in this position denotes that it remains unchanged between Images A and B, serving as a consistent element in both images. Therefore, the visual information confirms the presence of the tea light candle there.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bonsai and candle resting on a flat black surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no bonsai present; instead, there is a fantasy statue on a pedestal resting on a black surface. However, the tea light candle remains on the same black surface, indicating that the general setting with a flat black surface persists. From examining the edited image, itâ€™s reasonable to infer that the object now occupying the space once inhabited by the bonsai and candle in Image A is resting on the same type of surface.",

      "question": "Is the background uniformly light gray with no visible patterns or objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a uniformly light gray background, devoid of any patterns or other visible objects. This background is consistent and clean, emphasizing the edited statue as the main subject. The background's simplicity directs focus onto the central figure, which is the typical approach in photography to avoid distractions around the subject.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bonsai planted in a wide, shallow, teal-colored ceramic pot that occupies the center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bonsai is no longer present. It has been replaced by a fantasy statue on a detailed stone pedestal. As such, the inquiry regarding a bonsai and its pot is not applicable to the edited image, as these elements no longer appear in the composition. Thus, the analysis of Image B confirms there is no bonsai planted in any pot visible.",

      "question": "Are dark soil and exposed root matter visible at the surface of the pot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no bonsai and consequently no pot with soil or exposed roots. The focus is on a fantasy statue on a pedestal. Therefore, any references to observables such as soil and roots related to a bonsai do not apply to Image B, considering the changes in subject matter.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bonsai positioned centrally and upright in the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central subject is not a bonsai but a fantasy statue with illuminated wings and glowing eyes. This figurine is positioned centrally and upright in the frame, aligning with the typical compositional choice for showcasing a distinct object. Hence, despite the absence of a bonsai, the current subject maintains a central, upright position.",
