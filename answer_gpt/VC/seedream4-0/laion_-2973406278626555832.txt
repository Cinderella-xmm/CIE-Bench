    "Question": "Q1: Is the transparent tank section of the vape device clearly visible, allowing the internal liquid to be seen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part of the vaporizer design shows a transparent section allowing for visualization of the liquid inside. This transparency is crucial for monitoring liquid levels, which aligns with real-world functionality of vaporizers that often have a visible liquid tank to ensure users can see when a refill is necessary.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the black mouthpiece and cap at the top of the vape device present and correctly positioned?",
    "explanation": "The top section of the vaporizer in Image B appears to have a black mouthpiece, which is a typical design element for vaporizers, intended for ease of use and proper vapor inhalation. This describes a standard configuration where the mouthpiece is at the top for user accessibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the coil component located at the base of the device, visible through the transparent tank?",
    "explanation": "In the illustration component of Image B, the coil is depicted in a central position within the device's tank structure but not specifically at the base. The coil usually surrounds or connects to the battery section in real vaporizer designs, explaining its placement. The internal structure reveals the coil above the base to optimize heat transfer and vapor production.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the liquid inside the transparent tank clearly visible and present at a measurable level?",
    "explanation": "The illustrated view in Image B shows the liquid held within a transparent tank, with discernible upper and lower boundaries that indicate a specific volume or level. This is common in vaporizer devices to track the amount of liquid remaining for effective operation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the internal components (coil, liquid, battery) arranged in a logically consistent vertical alignment within the device?",
    "explanation": "Image B's schematic depiction presents an internal order where the battery, coil, and liquid components appear stacked vertically. This is a typical configuration facilitating current flow from the battery to the coil for heating the liquid, reflecting a sensible design following the device's functional requirements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is an airflow pathway indicated or implied in the deviceâ€™s structure, such as an inlet near the base?",
    "explanation": "In the diagram on Image B, there is a reference to airflow components and pathways. Specifically, notes like 'airflow' suggest an airflow design typically present in vaporizer architecture, though the exact positioning or inlet may not be explicitly detailed in the schematic sections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
