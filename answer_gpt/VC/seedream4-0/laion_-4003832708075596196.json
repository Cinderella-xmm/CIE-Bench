      "question": "Are all leaf-shaped elements in the image, including those used as heads, clearly five-pointed maple leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two characters have heads that resemble maple leaves; each seems to have a similar symmetrical design with five points. Based on common depictions of maple leaves, which are usually identified by a five-pointed structure, these elements are intended to represent maple leaves. Given this information, one can conclude that the leaf-shaped heads are indeed stylized maple leaves.",

      "question": "Are all leaf elements rendered exclusively in shades of orange, yellow, and red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heads of the characters are designed with distinctive leaf patterns using autumn-themed colors. Traditionally, autumn leaves are depicted with a warm color palette comprising shades of orange, yellow, and red. Upon observing the image, the leaves on the characters consistently utilize these colors without deviating from this palette. Thus, the leaf elements are rendered exclusively in shades of orange, yellow, and red.",

      "question": "Is there a solid brown rectangular border surrounding the central illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear outline that frames the two characters. The rectangular border is visually prominent and appears to be of a solid brown color. It is a continuous line with no breaks, delineating the area where the illustration is kept separate from any text outside this boundary. Based on this observation, it can be concluded that there is indeed a solid brown rectangular border surrounding the central illustration.",

      "question": "Is the background of the card uniformly white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to have a very light tone. While predominantly white, there might be a slight texture or light hue difference, but not enough to noticeably deviate from a white background. Given this information, and considering typical card designs often have a clean, white background to enhance visual elements, the background can be considered uniformly white.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the central illustration positioned centrally within the card, bounded by the rectangular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two characters and their surrounding text bubbles are positioned within a rectangle. This rectangle appears to be centered on the card's surface, with even margins framing the central area within the bounding rectangle. Using the alignment of the rectangle relative to the edges of the card as reference, it can be determined that the illustration is indeed centrally positioned.",
