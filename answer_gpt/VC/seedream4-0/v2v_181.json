      "question": "Does the edited image retain the sheep's four-legged body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is depicted as a cartoonish, festive character within a snow globe. It has a simplified, chibi-style design where the body is rounded and lacks distinct legs. Chibi-style representations often prioritize a cute, condensed look over anatomically accurate details, so the traditional four-legged structure isn't present. Instead, it features small, rounded forms for ease of depiction. Therefore, the body structure with four distinct legs is not retained in this design.",

      "question": "Is the sheep covered in a woolly coat resembling curly fleece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep within the snow globe features a simplified, stylized form with a texture that suggests a woolly coat. This is common in chibi and cartoon designs where texture is indicated rather than detailed. The visual elements suggest a general woolly appearance consistent with curly fleece, represented in a simple and cute manner suitable for the snow globe context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sheepâ€™s ears, eyes, nose, and mouth clearly visible and positioned in a way consistent with a real sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the snow globe, the sheep's depiction follows chibi artistic conventions. While the sheep has distinctly visible ears and eyes, the facial features like the nose and mouth are minimal and positioned in a way that enhances cuteness rather than realistic accuracy. Consequently, although the features are visible, they are not positioned or proportioned in a realistic manner consistent with a real sheep.",

      "question": "Does the clock retain a circular face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a clock with a circular face inside the snow globe. The clock face remains traditionally round, which is a common shape for analog clocks and thus aligns with typical design conventions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the numbers 1 through 12 present on the clock face in a clockwise arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face within the snow globe is designed to resemble a traditional analog clock. Upon inspection, all 12 numbers from 1 to 12 are present and arranged in a clockwise sequence, providing standard readability according to typical clock design.",
      "weight": 3,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B within the snow globe shows a well-defined circular face with clearly visible hour and minute hands, which are essential for indicating the time on analog clocks. These hands maintain a traditional design that facilitates understanding of the time.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the time shown on the clock face within the snow globe is 10:10. This is indicated by the hour and minute hands positioned at the corresponding numbers, which is a frequently used time for decorative or advertising purposes because the arrangement creates a visually pleasing symmetry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and the clock are positioned inside the same snow globe. They are depicted side by side in close proximity, forming a coherent and unified scene in the context of the snow globe's theme.",
