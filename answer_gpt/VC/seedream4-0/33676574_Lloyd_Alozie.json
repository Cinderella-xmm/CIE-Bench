      "question": "Is the distinctive golden lattice framework of the Address Downtown tower visible and structurally intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Address Downtown tower has been altered with blue neon lights and robotic arms, which replaces the original golden lattice framework with a futuristic design. The new design does not retain the golden lattice framework characteristic of the original structure. Hence, the appearance of the lattice framework is neither visible nor intact in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the cylindrical shape and curved top of the Emaar Tower preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building that resembles the Emaar Tower maintains its cylindrical shape and curved top. Despite the addition of neon lights and digital modifications, the basic architecture—being cylindrical with a curved top—remains recognizable. This conclusion is drawn from observing the distinct structural features, which align with the attributes of the Emaar Tower from world knowledge.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Address Downtown tower located to the left of the Emaar Tower in the skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the building presumed to be the Address Downtown tower, despite its futuristic alterations, is situated to the left of the structure resembling the Emaar Tower. This positional relationship is identifiable through the relative location of the modified structures, consistent with the known skyline arrangement.",

      "question": "Are the beige, low-rise buildings with arched windows visible in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, similar to Image A, the foreground includes a series of low-rise buildings. Although the details are less pronounced due to focus on the modified elements, the low-rise building structures with arches remain visible, suggesting that these form the lower tier of the skyline view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, amidst the futuristic alterations, there is a large structure discernible with a green roof and an illuminated frontage visible in the midground. These characteristics match the original building's features observed in Image A, indicating its presence remains unaltered aside from lighting modifications.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky appears predominantly dark blue, maintaining a backdrop for the illuminated and digitally altered buildings. The focal enhancements are on the buildings' illumination, and the sky is consistent without visible clouds or stars, providing a clear and uniform backdrop, as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are multiple skyscrapers and artificial enhancements, the resemblance to a tapering skyscraper is less obvious due to the addition of digital elements and effects. The glowing crown characteristic is either obscured or altered, differing from the original appearance.",
