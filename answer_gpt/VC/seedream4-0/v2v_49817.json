      "question": "Is the pencil sharpener still present and serving its function in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transitions into a carved relief, we see a similar representation of a pencil sharpener as observed in Image A. It is evident from the detailed carving that it has been portrayed with specificity, indicating its continued presence and function. This reflects an artistic choice to preserve the object and its intended role within the scene.",

      "question": "Are the three individuals still interacting in their respective roles (scribe, observer, attendant)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stone relief where the interaction between the figures is captured in a similar manner to Image A. Despite transitioning from a photograph to a carved scene, the roles are retained: the individual operating the sharpener appears as the scribe, the onlooker remains in an observer role, and the individual beside the sharpener suggests an assisting or attending presence.",

      "question": "Are the large windows still visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a relief, does not depict the large windows visible in Image A. The relief style omits background details in favor of focusing on the central figures, thus eliminating the window elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the relief representation without the detailed surface elements like scattered papers and pencils, which were seen in Image A. This artistic choice focuses attention on the principal figures, typical of reliefs, thus excluding smaller, intricate items from its depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the individuals in Image B remains similar to Image A. The depiction shows the scribe, observer, and attendant geographically linked as in their respective roles. The spatial arrangement recalls Image A, maintaining a coherent portrayal of their interaction.",
