    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the alternating pattern of light and dark squares on the chessboard preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alternating pattern of light and dark squares on the chessboard is clearly visible and follows the typical design of a chessboard. This pattern is standard for chessboards to aid in game visualization.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the king located in the central position of the visible row of black pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, while the pieces have been artistically transformed, assuming these artistic pieces correlate directly to original chess pieces, there's no distinctive chess king figure located centrally, as these figures don't bear the typical chess forms.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly two bishops, two knights, and at least four pawns visible in their original positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows fantasy figures that replace chess pieces, and they do not maintain a direct correlation to traditions of chess piece positions, particularly regarding bishops, knights, and pawns.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows of the chess pieces extend diagonally toward the bottom-left of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the replaced figures do indeed extend toward the bottom-left corner of the frame, a result of the light source's position relative to the objects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture of the chessboard surface visible across the light squares?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth texture on the light squares rather than a visible wood grain, suggesting an overlaid artistic effect with less texture emphasis.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a blurred background with horizontal structural lines visible behind the chessboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B does appear blurred, featuring horizontal elements or lines which do not sharply stand out due to the applied blur effect, suggesting depth to the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there exactly eight black chess pieces visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, after its artistic alteration, shows figures that could potentially correspond to chess pieces but do not display exactly eight, nor match standard chess piece types precisely.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the background of the image blurred while the foreground pieces are in sharp focus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, indeed, the background is out of focus providing depth while the foreground figures are in sharp focus, allowing detailed clarity on the artistic designs of the pieces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
