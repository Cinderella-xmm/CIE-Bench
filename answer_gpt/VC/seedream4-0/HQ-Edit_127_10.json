    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the intricate wrought-iron lattice structure of both Eiffel Towers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Towers inside the snow globe clearly display the intricate lace-like structure characteristic of the real Eiffel Tower's wrought-iron design. The visual cues, such as the detailed lattice design on both towers, suggest the effort to model these towers closely to their real counterpart.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are both towers supported by a triangular base composed of four distinct pillars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bases of the towers within the snow globe do not appear to have a discernible triangular shape or four distinct pillars. The design within the snow globe simplifies the base structure and doesn't explicitly highlight four distinct supportive pillars.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined archway beneath each tower through which the path passes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two miniature Eiffel Towers inside a snow globe, without any visible archways beneath them or paths appearing to pass through. The image does not depict a ground scene where people or vehicles are present passing through these towers.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene within the snow globe distinctly showcases exactly two Eiffel Towers placed side by side, maintaining a mirroring effect which is evident upon an initial viewing of the image without reference to external information.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each tower have a pointed spire at its apex?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both towers in Image B within the snow globe display a clear pointed spire at the top, consistent with common knowledge of the Eiffel Tower's design featuring a tapering point at the summit.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there three distinct horizontal platform levels visible along the height of each tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the towers inside the snow globe are depicted with some structural details, the towers do not distinctly showcase three separate platform levels. The small scale and artistic representation donâ€™t illustrate such structural granularity.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
