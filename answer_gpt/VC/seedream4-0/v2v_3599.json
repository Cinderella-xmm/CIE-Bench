      "question": "Is the wall behind the objects still light blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a wall behind the objects that appears to be light blue, consistent with the light blue tone in Image A. By not involving information from Image A directly, the analysis is still based on the observation that the background maintains a light blue color which aligns with what one would expect for a similar image setting.",

      "question": "Does the white crib with vertical bars and a curved headboard remain in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crib on the right side of the image has vertical bars and a curved headboard matching the description. Comparison with Image A recalls a similar design feature, confirming continuity in the furniture piece from Image A to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the crib mattress still patterned with yellow and gray cloud designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the mattress in Image B, the designs visible are consistent with having a cloud pattern in yellow and gray. Analyzing these patterns with the knowledge of designs common on crib mattresses, the cloud motif appears unchanged from Image A to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the new figures (medieval knights) still positioned along the wall near the crib, maintaining their relative alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the medieval knight figures in Image B aligns with the positioning of original objects in Image A, both sets being placed along the same wall near the crib. This indicates a maintained relative alignment despite the change in the object type from toys to knights.",

      "question": "Is the floor still covered with a beige carpet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual examination of Image B shows the floor is still covered in a carpet that appears beige. This can be reasoned through the consistent texture and color that signify a carpeted surface, similar to what was noted in Image A.",
