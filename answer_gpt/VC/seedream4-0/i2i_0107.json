        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style keychain clearly features round glasses, which is a distinctive characteristic often associated with the character of Harry Potter. Round glasses are part of the iconic imagery for this character, and thus, their presence in the chibi version is likely a direct representation. Analyzing this detail requires considering common design choices for stylized versions of characters, where distinctive accessories like glasses are often exaggerated or maintained to ensure recognizability.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the keychain character with brown hair. In character design, especially for chibi versions, maintaining distinct features like hair color is crucial for recognition. Brown hair is a defining trait of Harry Potter and is therefore represented in the chibi version. This is a conventional approach in character merchandising, where identifying features are kept consistent.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi keychain in Image B depicts the character wearing a white shirt and a red-and-yellow striped tie. This outfit matches the uniform commonly associated with the Gryffindor house from the Harry Potter series, which is important for character recognition and thus incorporated in the chibi version. The use of recognizable uniforms in chibi designs helps maintain the character's identity.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark cloak is evident as part of the chibi keychain's design. This type of cloak is traditionally linked to wizard robes, particularly as seen in the Harry Potter series. Maintaining such elements in a chibi representation ensures that the iconic aspects of the character are captured, even in a simplified form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi keychain in Image B preserves the key aspects of the color scheme seen in traditional representations of this character: brown hair, round glasses, a white shirt, a red-and-yellow tie, and a dark cloak. This color palette is consistent with the Harry Potter character's iconic look, ensuring that the chibi version is easily identifiable. The translation of the character's recognizable coloring into merchandise like keychains is a common practice to retain visual identity.",
