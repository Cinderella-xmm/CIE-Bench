      "question": "Is the child still seated on the edge of the path near the water container, facing away from the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child remains positioned at the same spot on the path, near the water container, and is still facing away from the house, similar to their positioning in Image A. This suggests no change in the child's position or orientation despite the transformations occurring to the house structure.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the continuity of the curved concrete path leading from the bottom right corner to the house, without noticeable deviations or interruptions, similar to Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, a smaller building with a rusted corrugated metal roof is visible to the left of the main house. This suggests that the smaller building has not been altered between images.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The satellite dish, which is present in Image A on the right side of the upper floor, extending outward, is not visible in Image B. This indicates that the satellite dish has been removed or altered significantly in the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the lower ends of the stilts firmly planted in the soil along the slope beneath the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure supporting the house has been transformed into tree-like forms rather than stilts, which drastically alters the connection to the soil. Therefore, the original stilts are no longer present or planted in the soil as they were in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B continues to display rolling green hills with dense forest and mist beneath a partly cloudy blue sky, consistent with Image A. The background environment remains largely unchanged in the edited version.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
