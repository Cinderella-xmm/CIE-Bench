      "question": "Are the carrots depicted in a bright orange color with their rounded-tapered shape preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are indeed bright orange and maintain a rounded-tapered shape. These visual cues match the typical appearance of carrots, which are generally known for their vibrant color and specific shape. Therefore, based on the visual evidence presented, the carrots clearly exhibit these characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the carrots topped with bright green serrated leaves with a lobed appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrots having bright green leaves with a visibly serrated and lobed appearance. Commonly, carrot leaves have this type of structure, allowing them to photosynthesize effectively. The characteristics of the leaves in Image B fit with what is typically observed with real carrot plants.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the soil texture surrounding the carrotsâ€™ roots preserved showing they are rooted in soil rather than snow or ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the area around the carrots includes patches of snow, the soil is partially preserved around the roots. The contrast between the soil texture and the snow implies that the carrots are rooted in the soil but surrounded by snow due to the environmental conditions in the image, typical of colder climates.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the carrots positioned in a way that shows they are partially underground, consistent with their natural growth pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrots partially emerging from the soil, indicating they are positioned underground in a typical manner consistent with their natural growth process. Carrots grow with most of their mass underground and only their leaves protruding above. This positioning is accurate and reflects the common cultivation pattern of carrots.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the carrots have visible surface textures like natural ridges or marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots in Image B display visible surface textures, including natural ridges and slight marks. Such features are often present on carrots due to their growth in soil, where pressure and environmental factors create these marks. The depiction of these textures in Image B is consistent with the appearance of real carrots.",
