    "Question": "Q1: Is the feathered plume still present on top of the knight's helmet?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the knight is shown as a chibi character encased in a glass dome, and the helmet is simplistic and lacks intricate details such as a plume. The design focuses on a minimalistic style, which often omits detailed accessories like plumes for simplicity. Therefore, the visual cue indicates that there is no feathered plume on top of the knight's helmet.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the knight holding a long spear or lance in their right hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight is holding a sword, not a long spear or lance.
