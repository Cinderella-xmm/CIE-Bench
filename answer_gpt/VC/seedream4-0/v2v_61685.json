      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is depicted with one foot on the skateboard, which suggests she is interacting with it, possibly preparing to move or showing a balance as one might when learning or demonstrating skateboard skills. The posture indicates an active engagement with the skateboard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's posture is mirrored as similarly to leaning over, showing that he is interacting with the skateboard. This posture suggests a stance aligned with watching or correcting something in relation to the skateboard.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl and the man appear to be physically adjacent to each other, as indicated by their proximity and posture. The man is leaning forward and the girl is leaning back slightly, both common stances when conversing or interacting while standing. This does suggest they are positioned next to each other with the railing in between.",
