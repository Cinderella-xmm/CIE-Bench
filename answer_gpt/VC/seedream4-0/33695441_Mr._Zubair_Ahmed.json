    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the concentric spiral structure of the staircase, with steps forming progressively smaller rings as they descend toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the spiral structure of the staircase is clearly visible, maintaining the circular form as it descends towards the center. The consistent curvature and alignment of the steps indicate that the concentric spiral pattern has been preserved. The visual cue of the progressively tighter rings confirms this observation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the parallel rectangular shadows cast across the steps by sunlight still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows parallel rectangular shadows cast across the steps, indicative of sunlight filtering in. These shadows appear in both images, adding texture and depth, confirming their presence in the edited version similar to the original.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a dark circular void at the center of the spiral, representing the bottom of the staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the central area of the spiral staircase remains dark, indicative of a void or opening characteristic of staircases that spiral around a central hole. This aligns with the typical visual features of spiral staircases where light diminishes at the core.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the handrail remain aligned along the outer edge of the spiral, following the same curvature as the steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a handrail that retains its alignment along the outer curve of the spiral staircase. Although it has been altered with a textured, scale-like appearance, it continues to follow the spiral's curvature similar to the original handrail, maintaining its structural function.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone steps still visible with their original texture, including faint veining and minor surface imperfections, even if reinterpreted as scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the steps display a scale-like texture, which implies a reinterpretation of the original stone texture. However, the essence of the original texture, with its faint veining and surface imperfections, has been stylized to fit this theme while the fundamental appearance of a solid step remains recognizable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows fall in the same diagonal direction across the steps as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pattern and direction of the shadows in the edited image remain consistent with those in the original image, falling diagonally across the steps. This suggests that the light source and its interaction with the staircase are depicted in a similar manner, preserving the ambiance and light directionality seen initially.",
