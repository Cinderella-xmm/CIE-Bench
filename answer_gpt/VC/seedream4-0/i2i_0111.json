      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I can observe the characteristic swirling patterns in the sky, which are a defining feature of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. The movement and flow of the brushstrokes creating the vortex are clearly visible. This suggests that the swirling vortex texture has been retained in the edited image. By analyzing this, I conclude that the swirling vortex texture remains intact.",

      "question": "Is the prominent crescent moon still visible in the upper right corner of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bright crescent moon in the upper right section of the sky can be seen. Although it appears slightly more luminous due to the glow effect in the edited image, its shape and position are consistent with the original painting's depiction. Based on this visual evidence, I can determine that the crescent moon is still visible.",

      "question": "Has the large cypress tree on the left side been preserved in the same elongated shape and relative position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tall, dark cypress tree positioned on the left, maintaining its distinctive elongated shape and relative location within the image. The tree follows the same vertical orientation and touches the bottom and top boundary quite similarly to Image Aâ€™s depiction. This confirms that the shape and position of the cypress tree have been preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the village and the tall church spire retained in their original positions under the night sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the village is depicted below the swirling night sky with rooftops and structures spread across the lower section. The church spire is distinctly visible, rising above the rooftops in the center bottom area of the image, maintaining its tall and slim structure. Comparing this alignment with the original image, their positions and forms appear consistent. Thus, the village scene and church spire have been retained in their original positions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the thick impasto texture and dynamic brushstrokes characteristic of Van Gogh's style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still features the thick, sweeping brushstrokes that are typical of the impasto style Van Gogh used. These textured strokes create depth and movement throughout the sky, ensuring that the dynamic quality of Van Gogh's technique is evident. While the glow effect alters the color vibrancy, the texture and brushstroke dynamism remain intact, signifying the preservation of Van Gogh's style.",
