      "question": "Is the conical, tiered structure composed of multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a conical, tiered structure with multiple horizontal levels stacked vertically, forming a shape resembling a Christmas tree. This is evident from the repeated horizontal layers diminishing in size as they move upward. The structural organization is maintained, which suggests continuity and preservation of form. Therefore, it appears that this setup is preserved in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets positioned at the center of each tier preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of teardrop-shaped chocolate droplets is visible at the center of several tiers. These shaped elements serve both as decorative and functional components of the structure, holding nuts and other decorations. Their repeated appearance and centralized positioning across tiers indicate that they have been preserved in the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate pinecone-like structures supporting each tier preserved in their original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate pinecone-like structures are visible, positioned vertically between the horizontal tiers. These resemble small, conical shapes typical of pinecones. Their presence as supports for each tier is consistent throughout the structure. Therefore, it can be inferred that these elements are preserved in their original form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nuts (including almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts) visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teardrop-shaped droplets contain visible nuts, such as almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts. These nuts are clearly gathered within the droplets, implying an intentional design choice to incorporate these components cohesively into the chocolate ornament. Thus, the nuts are visibly contained within the teardrop-shaped droplets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wide, circular base with a horizontal band at its edge preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the structure is wide and circular, easily identifiable from the image. The edge of this base features a horizontal band engraved with text and decorations, which is consistent with a design intended to stabilize the overall conical form. Therefore, the wide, circular base with its distinctive band is preserved.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme dominated by deep brown tones with gold highlights preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a dominant color scheme of deep brown, which is visually consistent across the different components of the structure, such as tiers and droplets. Additionally, gold highlights are evident particularly within the contents of the teardrop-shaped droplets, contributing to the luxurious aesthetic. This preservation of color scheme is apparent throughout the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the teardrop-shaped droplets centrally aligned along the vertical axis of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teardrop-shaped droplets are consistently placed along the central vertical axis of the structure. Their repeated alignment down the middle points to a design symmetry and balance, serving as central decorative focal points on each tier. As such, they are centrally aligned within the setup.",
