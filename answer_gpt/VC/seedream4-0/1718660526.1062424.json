      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the black stripes evenly distributed across the body, head, and legs in the same pattern as the original knitted animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black stripes appear to be composed of small individual tiles due to the mosaic pattern, creating an even distribution, but the overall appearance of the pattern may differ from Image A due to the nature of the mosaic tiles. Comparing with Image A, which has a smoother knitted texture, Image B's tile-based approach makes the stripes appear more segmented despite an even distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the snout present with two clearly defined, dark circular nostrils positioned symmetrically on the upper portion of the snout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snout is present, but the nostrils are not circular; instead, they are formed by small tiles. In comparison with Image A, where the knitted texture allows for clearly defined circular dark nostrils, Image B’s mosaic design does not maintain this clear definition due to its tile composition.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, and positioned symmetrically on the face, each consisting of a white outer ring and a central black pupil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes appear to be large, round, and symmetrical, with a clear white outer ring and a central black pupil. These features are represented through mosaic tiles but still maintain the fundamental characteristics seen in Image A. The comparison shows consistent features across both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mouth a clearly visible curved line forming a smile below the snout, consistent with the original animal’s expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouth is represented through a series of tiles forming a curved line below the snout, giving an appearance of a smile. Compared to Image A, where the mouth is a part of the knitted design, Image B manages to represent a similar expression but through the mosaic tile pattern. The smile is maintained in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the animal in a walking pose with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg grounded behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal is in a pose that suggests motion, with the left front leg extended forward and the right front leg positioned behind it on the ground. This walking pose is consistent with Image A, which shows a similar stance. The mosaic structure does not alter the positioning.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two small, rounded ears positioned symmetrically on top of the head, pointing slightly outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays two small, rounded ears created with mosaic tiles, positioned symmetrically on the head and seemingly pointing slightly outward. This arrangement is similar to Image A, which has knitted ears that are likewise symmetrical and slightly outward turned. The fundamental positioning is consistent across both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a surface with a visibly granular, uneven texture resembling natural sand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is placed on a surface that displays a visibly granular texture, indicative of natural sand. The presence of this sandy detailing is evident in Image B and resembles the setting seen in Image A, where the original object is also seen on sand. The environment in both images aligns.",
