    {

      "question": "Is the facial structure including the eyes, nose, beard, and smile preserved exactly as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The evaluation involves examining the facial structure and specific features such as eyes, nose, beard, and smile. Since the face is blurred in Image B, it is not possible to determine if these features are preserved. However, the question asks specifically about the preservation, implying a need to observe unchanged attributes, which cannot be confirmed here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue and green floral henna designs on the cheeks present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cheek region, in both images, should be assessed for the presence of blue and green floral henna designs. Since details of the cheek are obscured in Image B due to the blur effect, it is impossible to verify the presence or absence of the henna designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the small gold earrings visible in both ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To evaluate the visibility of small gold earrings, one needs to observe the ear region. Given that a portion of the face, including potentially the ears, is blurred in Image B, it is difficult to confirm the presence of the earrings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the peacock feather held in the right hand present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment requires identifying if a peacock feather is being held in the right hand. In Image B, there is no peacock feather seen in the right hand, verifying its absence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question is about the positioning of the right hand with respect to the chest and its interaction with a peacock feather. In Image B, while the right hand is positioned near the chest, there is no peacock feather present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The direction of the subject's gaze involves facial feature positioning, which cannot be discerned due to the blurred face in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the natural skin tone and texture of the subject preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Determining the preservation of skin tone and texture involves examining the visible parts of the face for natural color and surface detail. In Image B, since the face is blurred, the skin tone and texture cannot be confirmed to be preserved.",
