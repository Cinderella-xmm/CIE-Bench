      "question": "Is the amber-colored liquid visible in the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, the short glass contains an amber-colored liquid. This conclusion is drawn from the observation of the glass's content, which retains its original characteristics from Image A, such as the typical color and clarity of an iced tea or similar beverage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is a yellow straw inserted into the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible yellow straw in the short glass. This can be concluded by its color and position, which is a common feature found in drink glasses for sipping the beverage.",

      "question": "Are ice cubes visible within the short glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of ice cubes in the short glass is clearly visible in Image B. These cubes contribute to the drink's chilled appearance, aligning with the original Image A, where similarly noticeable ice cubes exist.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tall glass completely filled with ice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the tall glass appears filled with a pattern that resembles digital or pixelated elements rather than real ice. These elements mimic the appearance of ice but are more stylized, creating an abstract version inspired by technology themes.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sail-like shells of the Sydney Opera House visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B depicts the Sydney Opera House's distinct sail-like architecture, but stylized with neon lighting, contrasting with Image A's natural look. The common knowledge of the Opera Houseâ€™s iconic shapes supports these observations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a stone ledge beneath the two glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface below the glasses maintains a similar color and appearance to the ledge in Image A; however, its composition is altered to appear pixelated. Knowledge of typical ledge materials is applied here despite the altered appearance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the two glasses positioned side by side on the ledge, with the short glass on the left and the tall glass on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show the glasses side by side on the ledge, with their respective positions unchanged. This deduction is based on their spatial arrangement, which is consistent across both images.",
