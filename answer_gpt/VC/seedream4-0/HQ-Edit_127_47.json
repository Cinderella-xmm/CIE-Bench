    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly five ducklings swimming in the foreground of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass dome with toy ducks inside. The foreground does not have ducklings swimming freely but has toy ducks inside the dome, which are not real ducklings. This changes the number of ducklings depicted in the scene compared to Image A. Thus, there are toys, not real ducklings swimming, and do not include exactly five ducks visible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ducklings have their heads above water and bodies partially submerged, indicating swimming motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, toy ducks inside the dome don't exhibit the natural swimming pose of having heads above water and bodies partially submerged. They are static and do not reflect swimming motion realistically, as real ducklings might.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bed of smooth, rounded stones clearly visible beneath the water surface in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large glass dome with water and stones inside it. The foreground outside does not clearly show the bed of stones beneath the water as the scene is dominated by the dome structure and wooden surface, altering the view compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the evergreen trees and sky clearly visible on the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays reflections on the water through the glass dome, and not on the lake surface outside. Reflections are possible and visible in calmer water surfaces, within the dome rather than the overall lake scene as per the context of the comparison.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are tall evergreen trees densely arranged along both sides of the lake, forming a natural corridor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are visible around the lake outside the glass dome, the arrangement of dense evergreen trees is consistent with Image A, forming a natural corridor on both sides of the lake.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a mist-covered mountain range visible in the background beyond the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a mist-covered mountain range in the background, similar to Image A's depiction, indicating continuity in the scene's depth and atmospheric conditions that are typical of such landscapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors of the scene green (trees), blue-green (water), and brown (rocks)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the dominance of green, blue-green, and brown as the primary color palette through both the actual lake scenery and the contents within the glass dome, consistent with Image A's overall color scheme, though slightly altered in hues by more artificial elements.",
