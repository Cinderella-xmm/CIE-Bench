      "question": "Is the flag positioned at the top of the tallest central spire of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle within the glass globe has a noticeable flag positioned on the tallest central spire. This is determined by identifying the tallest point of the castle structure and observing the presence of a flag there. Flags are often placed on the highest points in models to indicate prominence, which is a common practice in castle depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two spiral staircases symmetrically positioned on either side of the central entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sandcastle with one visible spiral staircase leading up from the central entrance, but there is not a second staircase symmetrically positioned on the other side. Symmetry would imply identical or mirror images on both sides of the central feature, and in this case, only one spiral staircase is clearly visible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a central arched doorway with ornate latticework directly above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the central arched doorway is a prominent feature, but there is no ornate latticework directly above it; instead, the design is relatively plain without intricate patterns in the specified area. Ornate latticework would typically include detailed, decorative designs, which are not present in this image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least seven conical turrets visible around the perimeter of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, by counting the visible conical turrets surrounding the sandcastle within the glass globe, there are indeed at least seven clearly visible conical turrets. This can be inferred from the typical architectural style of castles that include multiple turrets to create a sense of grandeur.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are starfish and seashells visibly present around the base of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass globe displaying the sandcastle includes various decorative elements such as seashells at its base. Although starfish are not explicitly visible, a variety of seashells are present, mimicking the natural elements associated with a beach environment often used in decorative scenes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle designed with bilateral symmetry along its central vertical axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B closely, the sandcastle appears to be designed with bilateral symmetry along its central vertical axis. This means that the left and right sides of the central axis are mirror reflections of each other, a common feature in symmetrical structures to portray balance and cohesiveness in design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there decorative carvings visible on the surfaces of the towers and archways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, the surfaces of the towers and archways on the sandcastle within the glass globe do exhibit decorative carvings. These are visible as intricate designs along the surfaces, adding ornamental detail and enhancing the visual appeal, which is typical in miniature replicas and models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the tallest tower located at the center of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B reveals that the tallest tower is indeed located at the center of the sandcastle. Center positioning of the tallest tower is a common structural trait in many castle designs as it often serves as the focal point or keeps of the castle.",
