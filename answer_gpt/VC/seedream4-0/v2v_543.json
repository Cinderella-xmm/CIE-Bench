      "question": "Are the characters still depicted as actively skiing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are designed as chibi figures that appear to be dressed in traditional, festive attire, but they are still depicted in a skiing posture, using the ski poles and wearing skis. The positioning of their limbs and skis mimics skiing activity, suggesting that they are still actively skiing. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cue that their skis remain aligned with the snowy terrain, which is typical of skiing posture.",

      "question": "Are the characters still arranged in a line formation while skiing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters continue to be positioned in a formation that suggests they are skiing together. Their alignment is linear in nature, consistent with a group ski outing. The layout is similar to Image A, where the skiers are arranged in a group, suggesting they are maintaining the same line formation.",

      "question": "Do the characters still hold ski poles and wear skis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are illustrated holding ski poles and wearing skis, similar to the individuals in Image A. The poles are depicted attached to the charactersâ€™ hands, and skis are visible beneath their feet, indicating that they maintain the same skiing equipment as depicted before.",

      "question": "Is there still a visible snowy path beneath the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a snowy terrain as a prominent part of the setting, aligning with the festive decorations around. Despite the transformation in style and added decorations, the fundamental skiing environment remains unchanged, with a path made of snow clearly running beneath the characters, reminiscent of typical skiing conditions observed in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B gives the impression of forward movement for the characters, indicated by the direction in which they are facing and the alignment of their skis with the snowy path. The stance of the characters, with skis parallel to the path and poles angled for propulsion, echoes the strong suggestion of forward motion, just as in Image A.",
