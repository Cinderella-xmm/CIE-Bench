    "Question": "Q1: Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is not an actual piano but a gingerbread structure that artistically resembles a piano.

    "Question": "Q2: Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a gingerbread creation, and it does not have any legs, let alone four legs with golden casters as seen on a real piano. It is a flat decorative piece resting on a surface, unlike the functional design of a piano's legs.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are there exactly three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard?",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the keys arranged in the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys across the full length of the keyboard?",

However, this representation may not accurately reflect the full and precise arrangement of keys as on a real piano. However, since the depiction suggests a typical arrangement, it will be considered as fulfilling this requirement.",
