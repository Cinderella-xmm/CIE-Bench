      "question": "Does the lion’s silhouette retain the distinct, wide, rounded mane shape around its head and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is presented as a silhouette, which means its detailed features are not visible, but the outline still provides clues. The silhouette has a large, wide, rounded shape around the head and neck area, which is consistent with the typical mane shape of a lion. This suggests that the lion's silhouette retains its distinct mane shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lion depicted with its front legs forward and rear legs bent, maintaining a poised, dominant stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the lion's silhouette shows its front legs extended forward while the rear legs appear bent, suggestive of a dynamic, poised stance --- a typical depiction of a dominant lion pose. The pose reflects the lion's readiness to move and dominance in its environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lion’s head turned slightly toward the viewer, rather than fully in profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion's head suggests a profile view with no clear indication of the head turning toward the viewer. The absence of visible features like eyes or nose in the front-facing direction implies a side profile orientation, indicating that the head is not turned toward the viewer.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there grass present in the foreground beneath the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette clearly includes grass extending from the foreground into the lower part of the lion’s legs, creating a natural setting typically associated with a savannah landscape where lions are found. The presence of grass is visible around the feet of the lion in the silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are acacia trees visible in the background, either as natural forms or stylized silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the background with distinct tree silhouettes resembling acacia trees, characterized by their flat-topped canopies, which are visible and become part of the landscape behind the lion's silhouette. This matches the typical look of acacia trees in silhouette form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned in the foreground, centered and large in scale relative to the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lion in Image B is positioned prominently in the foreground, dominating the scene. It occupies a central position and is significantly larger compared to the elements in the background, like the trees. This emphasizes the lion's importance and its role as the focal point of the image.",
