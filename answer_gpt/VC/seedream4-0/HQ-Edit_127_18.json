      "question": "Are the elephant's tusks present and curved outward in a natural arc, extending from the mouth and tapering toward the tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's tusks are visibly present and are curved in a natural arc, starting at the mouth and tapering towards the tips. Typical elephant tusks extend outward in this manner, and this depiction matches common elephant anatomy. The curvature and tapering are clearly evident, illustrating a realistic portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the elephant's skin display deep, wrinkled folds across the forehead, neck, and body, consistent with natural elephant dermatology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skin of the elephant in Image B shows deep, wrinkled folds across its forehead, neck, and body. This texture is characteristic of real elephant skin, which tends to have thick, wrinkled skin to help with temperature regulation and provide flexibility. The depiction matches this natural texture.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the acacia tree present with a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches above the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an acacia tree present, featuring a broad, flat canopy and extended horizontal branches. The tree is positioned beside the elephant, and these characteristics are typical of acacia trees found in African landscapes. This depiction matches the natural appearance of such trees.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the foreground covered in tall, golden-yellow grass blades that extend upward and show subtle motion from wind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass in the foreground seems to be modeled to look like real grass but is static with no indication of motion from wind. This differs from the dynamic portrayal of windblown grasses typically found in nature or atmospheric images. The grass appears intentional rather than naturally dynamic.",
      "weight": 2,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are snow-capped mountains visible in the background, forming a distant ridge line behind the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, snow-capped mountains are depicted, forming a distant ridge line behind the elephant. The inclusion of mountains creates a three-dimensional, scenic landscape consistent with the background setting of an African safari, matching the portrayal of mountainous regions that could be part of a diorama or film set.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elephant's trunk curled at the tip and showing segmented ridges along its length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's trunk is presented with a slight curl at the tip, and while ridges are present, they are visually subtle due to the simulated nature of the model in the image. Real elephant trunks usually show more pronounced ridges and curling. This depiction includes these elements but in a simplified manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the elephant's ears have a large, broad, fan-shaped outline with visible internal folds and a downward flare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B has ears that are depicted in a large, broad, fan-shaped outline, showing internal folds and a downward flare. This matches the typical features of an elephant's ears, which serve to help with thermoregulation and hearing.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a source from the upper left, casting shadows on the right side of the elephant and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting seems uniform and is not distinctly coming from an upper left source. Shadows are not particularly defined, suggesting artificial or studio lighting, which doesn't produce the directional shadow effect seen from a natural light source. Hence, the lighting creates diffused illumination rather than directional shadows.",
