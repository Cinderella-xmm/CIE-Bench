      "question": "Are the irises of the eyes still blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, making it impossible to discern specific facial details like the iris color. Without visible cues, we cannot confirm the eye color. Based on the visible information, the answer is derived from the lack of identifiable features to suggest any visible eye color.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the facial details are blurred, making it impossible to distinguish the precise facial structure such as the nose, jawline, or cheekbones. Therefore, we cannot confirm changes in the facial structure based on the visible information.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is facing forward with their body slightly turned to the left, which is evident from the posture and alignment of the body visible in the image, displaying a stance that suggests this positioning.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual observation in Image B, the skin appears metallic and artificial, consistent with a robotic design. This does not resemble a natural light complexion, instead showing traits indicative of a futuristic or stylistic character design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred facial features in Image B, the lips and their expression are not visible. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if they are closed or exhibiting a particular expression.",
