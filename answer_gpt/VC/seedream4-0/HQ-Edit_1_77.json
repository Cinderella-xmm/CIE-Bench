    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the multi-layered beaded neckpiece composed of alternating red, white, blue, and black horizontal bands still present in the same layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the multi-layered neckpiece is visible and maintains the alternating red, white, blue, and black bands similar to Image A. The structure appears unchanged as the bands consistently alternate and have multiple layers encircling the neck. The analysis involved identifying the colors and pattern continuity which aligns with the traditional beaded design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the central red vertical thread extend downward from the center of the neckpiece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a central red vertical thread extending downward from the neckpiece, clearly visible in the center, which matches Image A's description too. The reasoning involved spatial positioning of the thread in comparison to the neckpiece layers.",

    {

      "question": "Is the blue-and-white beaded headband positioned across the forehead with silver-like dangling strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headband in Image B appears across the upper head region like a crown rather than specifically across the forehead with dangling strands. It consists of blue and white beads, but lacks noticeable silver-like dangling strands visible in its design, differing from any forehead positioning expectations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are discernible red bead-like elements positioned in the hair above the headband. These red elements are clearly present among and integrated with the hairstyle, contributing to the decorative arrangement above the headband.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains beaded bracelets on the forearms utilizing the same recurring color pattern of red, white, blue, and black that matches the necklaces. The consistent color and pattern are visible in each bracelet, appearing on both arms, indicating such pieces are included.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the necklaces positioned high on the neck, the headband on the forehead, and the bracelets on the upper forearm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklaces in Image B are positioned high around the neck, consistent with the fashion shown. While the headband is positioned on the upper head area rather than directly on the forehead, the bracelets are on the forearm. The difference in headband placement, compared to forehead expectations, renders an overall distinct arrangement.",
