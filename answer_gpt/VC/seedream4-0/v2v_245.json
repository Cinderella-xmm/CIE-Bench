      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two jet engines mounted under the wings of the airplane present and correctly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jet engines are mounted under the wings and appear correctly positioned on the wing structure, similar to Image A. The visual positioning relative to the airplane's wings matches typical configurations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows visible along the side of the fuselage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a continuous row of oval-shaped passenger windows on the fuselage, similar to Image A. This is generally found in commercial airplanes and signifies areas designed for passenger seating.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the rounded nose cone with the three-part cockpit window configuration present at the front of the airplane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a rounded nose cone with a noticeable cockpit window configuration at the airplane's front, parallel to what is observed in Image A. This three-part window layout is typical for standard passenger airplanes.",
