      "question": "Is the Mustang logo visible and intact on the grille in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three views of the car: two side views and a top view. In the two side views, the front of the car is seen but the grille is not directly visible, making it impossible to confirm the presence of the Mustang logo from these angles. The top view does not provide visibility of the grille either. Therefore, without a direct view of the grille, it cannot be determined if the Mustang logo is intact from all angles.",

      "question": "Does the side view of the car include the GT badge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side view of the car clearly shows a small badge on the fender located near the front wheel, which matches the common placement of a GT badge in Mustang models. This suggests the presence of the GT badge in the side view.",

    {

      "question": "Are the wheels depicted with the same black multi-spoke design in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents consistent wheel design featuring a black multi-spoke pattern in all views, including both side perspectives and the top view. The presence of this specific design is uniform throughout, indicating consistency across all views.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the car in black color in all depicted views, and the shape of the car is consistent with the standard sleek design of a Mustang coupe. The coherence in visual presentation, color, and contour across multiple perspectives confirms the consistency.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side views show the headlights in traditional positions at the front of the car, while the rear perspective shows exhaust outlets in typical Mustang placement. The design details in these elements appear correct and are appropriately positioned relative to vehicle perspectives shown.",
