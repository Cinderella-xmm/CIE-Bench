        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three triangular sails are visible on the dhow, and they are arranged in such a way that they appear to be staggered vertically from left to right. The staggered arrangement is a common setup for multiple sails on a traditional sailing vessel to maximize wind capture. Despite the addition of ornate designs, the structure and arrangement of the sails remain unchanged from standard sailing configurations.",
