      "question": "Are the broad shoulder pauldrons with their intricate engraved patterns still present and recognizable in the keychain version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited chibi design (Image B) simplifies many elements while retaining their recognizable form. The shoulder pauldrons are present on the character, with simplified patterns that indicate their original intricate engravings. Chibi art often reduces complexity while keeping identifiable characteristics intact.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "According to the edited image (Image B), the cloak is absent as chibi designs tend to minimize or exclude some elements for simplicity. It focuses more on key identifying features like armor and hairstyle rather than additional clothing like cloaks.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited chibi keychain version (Image B), the character's eyes are stylized and simplified but appear black rather than blue. Chibi artwork often exaggerates eyes, making them larger and sometimes changing their color for aesthetic purposes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) depicts a stylized high collar that reflects its presence from the original image. In chibi designing, key features like collars are simplified but recognizable, maintaining their integral placement around the neck.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) maintains the engraved patterns on the chest armor, which are simplified yet recognizable in the design. Chibi art handles details by distilling them to simpler forms that still acknowledge the original ornate designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi design (Image B) significantly alters the facial structure to fit the chibi style, which is common in such artistic renditions. It simplifies features into rounded and softened shapes, which do not retain the original jawline, nose, or cheekbone details.",
