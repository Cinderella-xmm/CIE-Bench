    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"DUCATI\" text in white lettering clearly visible along the down tube of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a red bicycle with an anthropomorphic face that features the 'DUCATI' text prominently displayed in white on the down tube, which is a common branding placement for bicycles. Thus, the text is clearly visible, confirming the choice.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"DUCATI\" text in white lettering visible on the seat stay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seat stay does not visibly display any text. Typically, branding is more apparent on the main tubes like the down tube rather than smaller areas like the seat stays. This observation leads to the conclusion.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the word 'SPORT' on the bicycle's top tube, which in Image A is seen near the head tube. The absence of this detail in the edited image indicates that the word is not present.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible 'TECH' lettering below the bottom bracket. Image A had this labeling, but the edited image does not show it, suggesting it may have been removed or obscured in this version.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main frame of the bicycle is clearly depicted in a bright red color. Red is identifiable as a common color for Ducati branding, supporting the conclusion that the frame is predominantly red.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The saddle and handlebars in Image B are portrayed in black, which is a common neutral color choice for these parts on a bicycle, making them easily recognizable and confirming the choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle chain is seen extending from the front crankset to the rear cassette, which is typical of bicycle gear systems, indicating a functional connection and confirming the choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tires appear to have consistent sidewalls without a reflective silver stripe. Image A has such details on the sidewall, but this edited version of the bicycle does not include them, pointing to the conclusion.",
      "weight": 1,

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the wheel hubs centrally located on both front and rear wheels. This detail is clear and typical in bicycle design for balance and rotation, confirming the visibility and supporting the answer.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bicycle frame with a normal diamond shape formed by the connections between the top tube, down tube, seat stays, and chain stays. This is a standard frame design, verifying that the structure remains unchanged.",
