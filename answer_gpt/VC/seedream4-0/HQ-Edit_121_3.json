      "question": "Is the central flower beneath the butterfly a pink coneflower with a prominent spiky central cone and drooping pink petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flower beneath the butterfly displays characteristics matching a pink coneflower, known for its prominent spiky central cone and drooping pink petals. This conclusion is drawn by observing the visual elements, such as the cone's texture and the shape and color of the petals. The world knowledge about coneflowers supports this observation, aligning with typical depictions of this plant.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned directly above the central cone of the flower, with its body aligned vertically over it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a butterfly is positioned directly above the central cone of the flower. This alignment is evident as the structure's body runs along the vertical axis above the cone. This analysis uses visual observations of alignment and positioning relative to the flower.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tall golden grasses and additional pink coneflowers visible in the background behind the main flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes tall golden grasses and additional pink coneflowers, enhancing the meadow-like scene. The visual information showing grasses with a golden hue and other flowers similar to the central one supports this conclusion. Common elements like grasses and wildflowers in a meadow setting further confirm this.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky a pale blue with soft white clouds and a warm golden light illuminating the meadow from below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is depicted as pale blue with soft white clouds, consistent with a daytime scene with gentle illumination. The meadow's lighting possesses a warm golden hue, often resulting from the sun's position. The analysis combines observations of color and light patterns typical in such atmospheric conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small clusters of purple wildflowers and pink spiky blooms visible among the grasses in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small clusters of purple wildflowers among the grasses, along with pink spiky blooms, suggesting diverse floral elements. Visual cues indicate variations in shape and color spread throughout the scene. This aligns with typical meadow compositions with assorted flora.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the central cone of the flower have a spiky, bristly texture made of densely packed dark-tipped florets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central cone of the flower exhibits a texture indicative of densely packed dark-tipped florets, typical of spiky, bristly blooms. This conclusion is derived from visual inspection of cone details that suggest depth and texture.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features petals of the central flower that curve downward with a smooth, elongated shape and soft pink hue. Observing these visual attributes provides evidence of their form and coloration, typical of coneflowers in their natural presentation.",
