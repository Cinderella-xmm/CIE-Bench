    "Question": "Q1: Is the eagle’s head white?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture of the eagle shows its head in white. This is consistent with the typical appearance of a bald eagle, which is a well-known bird of prey with a stark white head, making it easy to identify. This understanding comes from recognizing this traditional color pattern associated with bald eagles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the eagle have a yellow beak with a hooked tip?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle under the glass dome has a beak that is yellow, and it is depicted with a hooked tip. This corresponds with how eagles, particularly bald eagles, naturally have beaks designed for tearing flesh, which is a characteristic learned through biological knowledge and observation of such birds.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the tail feathers white and fanned out?",
    "explanation": "In the sculpture shown in Image B, the tail feathers appear to be white and fanned out. This description aligns with the typical structure observed in bald eagles, where the fanning aids in flight control and stability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the body of the eagle primarily dark brown?",
    "explanation": "The body of the eagle within the dome in Image B is shown with a dark brown coloration. This body color, matching the natural appearance of bald eagles, where the dark brown body emphasizes the contrasting white of the head and tail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the wings fully extended upward and outward in a soaring pose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the eagle within the dome shows wings that are positioned upward and outward, which is typical of a soaring or gliding position in birds. However, since it's a sculpture, the pose is limited and less dynamic compared to an image capturing motion, thus it's not fully extended to the degree seen in actual flight.",
    "answer": "No"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the eagle have a visible yellow eye?",
    "explanation": "Despite traditional features of bald eagles having yellow eyes, in Image B, the sculpture’s representation of the eagle does not clearly show the eye, as it is stylized or not detailed enough to depict the eye distinctly.",
    "answer": "No"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the wings show layered feather patterns with darker tips and lighter bases?",
    "explanation": "The eagle's wings in the sculpture in Image B do not explicitly show detailed feather patterning with darker tips and lighter bases as observed in a lifelike depiction. Therefore, the usual feather pattern as seen on real eagles isn’t visible here.",
    "answer": "No"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the overall silhouette of the eagle consistent with a bald eagle in mid-flight?",
    "explanation": "The silhouette in Image B, depicting an eagle encased in a dome, is stylized to display a frozen dynamic motion which echoes that of a bald eagle in flight. However, it's a stylized artistic representation lacking the full dynamic form observed in genuine mid-flight images as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
