        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky shows the characteristic swirling vortex texture typically associated with Vincent van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. This texture is discernible through the use of multiple circular brushstroke patterns, creating a sense of movement across the sky. Recognized for its dynamic representation, this design is unmistakably retained in Image B.",
