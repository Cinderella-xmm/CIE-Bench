      "question": "Is the cat's fur entirely black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate a stuffed toy resembling a cat rather than a real cat. The toy is represented with what appears to be black fur-like material. Since the toy is plush and not an actual animal, the color perception is based on the nuances of the representation. Therefore, when assessed visually, the fur appears uniformly black on the toy.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stuffed toy version of the cat is wearing a tie around its neck. The plush toy is seen holding a notebook, dressed formally complete with a tie, much like a humorous representation of a studious or office-themed cat.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the stuffed toy cat having large bright yellow eyes, characteristic of a stylized or cartoonish interpretation of an animal. These eyes are not only distinct but central in giving the toy its character.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stuffed toy is placed on a surface that has the appearance of a carpet, and its color is a beige tone. This provides a neutral background that complements the black of the toy cat, making it stand out.",
