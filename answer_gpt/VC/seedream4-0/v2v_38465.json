      "question": "Is the sunset visible on the horizon with its reflection on the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset is visibly set near the horizon, casting an orange glow across the scene. The reflection of the sun can be seen shimmering on the water's surface, indicating that the sunset and its reflection are indeed present. This understanding combines the visual cues of a circular bright object aligned with the horizon line and the typical behavior of light reflecting on water.",

      "question": "Does the sandy beach retain its texture and extend across the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandy beach in Image B is clearly visible, with texture details implying a realistic representation of sand. It extends across the bottom portion of the image, confirming the continuation of the beach throughout the lower segment of the scene.",

      "question": "Are the ocean waves present, showing natural movement near the shore?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are present and show a natural progression towards the shore. The visual detail of waves rolling and breaking near the shoreline suggests a dynamic, moving ocean typical of real-world coastal scenes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors (yellow on the left, red and teal on the right) and upright positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the surfboard on the left remains yellow, and the one on the right retains the red and teal colors. Both surfboards are positioned upright, similar to their positions in typical beach settings for surfboards. These characteristics reflect consistency in color and arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original humans, with one arm holding the surfboard and both facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas replace the original humans and mimic their poses. Each panda stands upright beside a surfboard, using one arm to hold it, and both face towards the sunset. This positioning mirrors the original image composition but with pandas instead of humans.",
