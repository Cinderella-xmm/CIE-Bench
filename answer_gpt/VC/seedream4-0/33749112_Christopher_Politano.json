    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three distinct mountain peaks—two broad and one sharp—present and positioned in the same relative layout as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct mountain landscape, but its presentation is dominated by a fantastical creature. The peaks in the background may resemble the sharp and broad peaks in Image A, but the emphasis on fantasy elements suggests a significant change. Image A showcases three distinct peaks as being part of a natural scene, while Image B integrates a mythical element, which evidences that the original mountain layout is not preserved in the same way.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lake located in the same basin with the same irregular shape, including the curved western edge and shallow extension toward the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the immediate visual focus is on a large fantasy creature, and the terrain depicted around the creature is not clearly centered on a lake or basin. Image A clearly shows a lake at the bottom of the basin with distinctive edges, which this fantastical and artistic portrayal does not replicate. The fantastical scene overshadows depicting the basin's features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trails maintain their original routing pattern across the slopes, including their connection to the lake and convergence points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B gives precedence to a fabulous creature and artistic depiction rather than terrain details. The sloping paths around the lake in Image A are unchanged and fade away in the fantastic integration in Image B, making it difficult to identify paths consistent with the original layout.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible human figures present near the shoreline of the lake, consistent with their placement in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the extravagant mythical creature overshadows any typical landscape details or human presence seen in Image A. Focusing on the creature, there are no visible human figures as featured near the lake in Image A. Such figures are absent from the creature-centric depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the rocky outcrops and boulders visible along the shoreline and slopes, maintaining their original distribution and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the natural terrain with a mythical creature and artistry, which diversely transforms mountain terrain. The shoreline rocky details from Image A are lost, substituted by a fantastical beast and surreal features. Therefore, the rocky outcrops aren't consistently maintained from Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the green vegetation cover present across the slopes, maintaining its general distribution and density as seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction contains artistic and mythic themes including areas akin to moss on the creature rather than coherent slopes with vegetation seen in Image A. The fantastical additions alter the landscape and don't retain traditional vegetation details of Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the sky clear blue with scattered wispy clouds, matching the original atmospheric conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does preserve a clear blue sky, with the addition of whimsical fantasy elements like a galaxy effect, which modifies the atmosphere's look from its original simplicity in Image A. While both have a blue sky, Image B's excessive fantasy element transforms it beyond just clouds.",
