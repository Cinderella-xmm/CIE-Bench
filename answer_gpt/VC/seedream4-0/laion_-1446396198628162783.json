      "question": "Is the NASA logo clearly visible on the left shoulder of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the NASA logo is visible on the left shoulder of the space suit. The logo is identifiable by its circular shape and the presence of the NASA text with a red swoosh. Visual recognition combined with common knowledge of the logo allows for this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red trim bands visible on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, red trim bands are noticeable both on the upper arm and lower leg of the space suit. This detail is apparent through the color contrast of the red against the white fabric of the suit, which fits the typical design of astronaut suits.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the white backpack unit attached to the back of the suit, with coiled white hoses extending down the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a white backpack unit situated on the back of the astronaut. Coiled white hoses are extending down the sides, which is consistent with typical space suit designs where life-support functions are often incorporated into a backpack unit.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visor of the helmet is raised, though it stops short of revealing the entire face of the astronaut. The design of the helmet supports partial visibility, essential during certain pre-flight checks or media appearances.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is shown standing in an upright position. Their body orientation is towards the right side of the image, evident from the positioning of limbs and the direction of the helmet.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are hoses visibly connected from the backpack unit to the torso area of the suit. This connection is critical for the functionality of the suit, providing necessary life-support and communication lines.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the astronaut’s boots and gloves visible and properly attached to the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's boots and gloves are clearly visible and appear properly attached to the rest of the space suit, a detail pivotal for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the suit during space activities.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a blue tarp on the floor beneath the astronaut. Instead, the background is of a control room setting, making it evident that there is no tarp present.",
