      "question": "Are the cardinal direction labels N, E, S, and W clearly visible and correctly positioned on the embossed compass face of the perfume bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cardinal directions N, E, S, and W appear clearly labeled and positioned correctly on the compass face, as indicated by the visual cues around the outer edge of the design. The presence of these labels in their conventional positions suggests familiarity with traditional compass designs. In Image A, similar cardinal labels are visible around the compass face, positioned in alignment with the standard format, supporting the comparison that these cardinal directions are retained and correctly positioned in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the full 360-degree scale with numerical markings (e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270) present and evenly spaced around the outer edge of the embossed compass face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no numerical markings visible like 0, 90, 180, 270 that would indicate a full 360-degree scale around the compass face. Instead, the cardinal directions are emphasized on the compass design. Comparing this to Image A, which shows a numerical scale with similar markings around the compass edge, the absence of such markings in Image B indicates that the full numerical scale is not present.",

      "question": "Does the embossed compass face retain the original eight-pointed star-like radial pattern with symmetrical arms extending from the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a compass face with an eight-pointed star-like pattern, characterized by symmetrical arms extending from the center, which matches traditional compass designs. The design exhibits uniformity and radial symmetry typical of star patterns used in navigation tools. Comparing to Image A, which also features a similar star-like radial pattern with symmetrical extensions, it is evident that the essential design is retained.",

      "question": "Is the body of the perfume bottle perfectly circular in shape, matching the original compassâ€™s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle's body appears perfectly circular, consistent with the design parameters usually associated with round objects. The visual cues suggest that the body maintains the original circular shape akin to traditional compasses. Observing Image A, the compass is also distinctly circular, validating the comparison and indicating that the shape consistency is kept across both images.",

      "question": "Does the cap of the perfume bottle feature engraved cartographic details such as a compass rose and intersecting grid lines, matching those seen on the map fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cap of the perfume bottle presents engraved cartographic details resembling a compass rose with grid lines intersecting, akin to those found in detailed map illustrations. These representations reflect the complexity and style of maps used for navigation and exploration. In comparison with Image A, where maps with compass rose elements are visible among the fragments, it suggests that similar cartographic details are indeed engraved on the cap.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small central raised dot or hub at the exact center of the embossed compass face, corresponding to the original needle pivot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a central raised hub or dot at the compass face's center is visible, indicative of the needle pivot typically found in compass designs, which aids in the function and balance. Comparing this to Image A, which displays a similar central feature that aligns with traditional needle pivots, the comparison suggests consistency in design between both images.",

      "question": "Is the outer ring of the embossed compass face clearly delineated with fine engravings and consistent spacing between degree marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show an outer ring with finely engraved degree marks or consistent spacing indicative of a detailed scale. Instead, more general directional indicators are prioritized in the design. In comparison to Image A, which features finely spaced engravings along the outer compass ring, the absence of similar detail in Image B indicates inconsistency and lack of such markings.",
