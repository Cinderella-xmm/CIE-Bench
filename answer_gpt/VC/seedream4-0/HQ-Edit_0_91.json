      "question": "Is the circular golden medallion located at the center of the floral panel on the chest still present and positioned in the same place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the medallion at the center of the floral panel is clearly visible. It retains its location on the chest as seen in the design pattern of the robe. The presence and location are identical to what is typically found in traditional robes, and have not been altered in positioning compared to what would be expected. Analyzing Image A also confirms this arrangement in the design, and Image B mirrors this placement precisely.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hair is depicted as white and appears to be parted on the left side before being swept back.
