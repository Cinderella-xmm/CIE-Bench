      "question": "Is the \"POLICE\" and \"CME\" text present on the driver’s side door in the same position and font style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the text present on the driver's side door appears to be part of the design similar to a LEGO model. Common sense suggests that LEGO designs simplify details, so text might be represented more minimally or not precisely replicated from real-world designs. The text 'POLICE' and 'CME' was present and noticeable in Image A with likely clearer visibility and style suited for a real police car. In Image B, given the LEGO nature which often omits or stylizes details, the text may not be identical or may follow LEGO's stylistic choices.",

      "question": "Is the gold-colored badge emblem with a shield and star design located on the driver’s side door?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge emblem on the LEGO model's driver's side door is simplified due to the limitations of LEGO design principles, which often require greater abstraction to translate real-world details into block-based forms. In Image A, the original police car features the gold badge emblem as part of more intricate details expected on actual vehicles. The LEGO model reflects this detail through a stylized version, confirming that while present, it may not perfectly replicate the real-world form.",

      "question": "Does the rooftop light bar have the exact red-blue-red-blue color sequence from left to right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Using common sense and observation, Image B, the LEGO-based image, features the light bar with a color sequence typically represented in LEGO sets. Given the clarity of blocks, the red-blue color sequence on the light bar translates easily into LEGO form, which is consistent with real-life representations for toy models. Comparing with Image A, the original police car also mirrors a standard pattern, suggesting the LEGO version aimed to replicate this distinct sequence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited LEGO model vehicle grille is stylized according to typical toy design principles, with emphasis on using blocks that reflect general shapes rather than fine details like slats. Image A's real police car features detailed grille work including horizontal slats and potential chrome elements expected in real contexts. The simplification inherent in LEGO designs leads to a lack of such detailed features and therefore does not match the description exactly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a license plate on the LEGO model which must be limited in text due to space and design constraints typical of block-based models. Common sense suggests LEGO sets might feature simplified or stylized text. In Image A, there's the potential for detailed labeling suiting a real police car with multiple lines, suggesting changes might appear in LEGO models. The text visible indicates different wording compared to the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a LEGO model, simplified yet still capturing iconic structural elements of four-door sedans like a long hood and trunk. The modular design respects real-world dimensions but adapts them into an unmistakably blocky silhouette. Image A's original car confirms the accurate general form which serves as a foundation for LEGO's effort to mimic vehicle structures despite reduced detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B uses blocks to form headlights and turn signals, inherently symmetric due to modular design constraints. World knowledge on LEGO assembly provides insight into maintaining symmetry smoothly. Image A's complex design upholds symmetrical elements originating from real vehicle templates. The LEGO adaptation simplifies but mirrors real layouts through block placements, ensuring consistency in form replication.",
