      "question": "Is there at least one horn present on the forehead of the unicorn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn clearly features a prominent horn on its forehead.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) showcases a unicorn sculpture with four legs, structured in a firm and balanced stance reminiscent of a horse's pose. The straight alignment of the legs is typical of equine creatures, consistent with the stance of the unicorn.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is positioned facing slightly to the viewer's left side, not towards the right. The placement of the head and the visibility of the left side suggest that the unicorn is not in a three-quarter view facing the right.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn does feature an eye that is visible. The eye is distinctly dark and oval-shaped, located on the side of the unicorn's head, which is consistent with typical animal anatomy practices used in sculptures for realistic portrayal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's head is slightly turned, showing part of its left side. This orientation allows viewers to see the left side of its face prominently. The head is not facing directly forward or away, confirming the slight turn.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
