        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown wearing a full face mask with distinct geometric designs and pointed ears, identifying them as a superhero, likely Black Panther.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character's suit, which appears to be intricately textured with a pattern resembling panther scales.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the suit features metallic accents on the shoulders and chest that resemble claws, which are signature design elements of Black Panther's costume.

      "question": "Does the character maintain a confident stance with arms relaxed downward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is standing on top of a building with a robot, seemingly interacting with a device. However, the stance is more cooperative and interactive rather than simply confident and relaxed. The action diverges somewhat from a purely relaxed stance, given the character's engagement in capturing an image. This suggests a mix of confidence and activity rather than fully relaxed posture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B retains the characteristic sharp lines and contours that define Black Panther's costume. The streamlined and angular design elements contribute to the character's sleek and powerful look. These sharp lines are key to the overall aesthetic and functionality of the suit, signifying that these design features have been retained in the edited image.",
