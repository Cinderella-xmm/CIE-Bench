      "question": "Is the black knit beanie present on the head of the figure in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figure is depicted with its head gear clearly visible. The visual clues in Image B show the presence of a hat, but the style and color differ from the description provided; it looks more like a brown, wide-brim hat suited for travel or adventure themes, rather than a black knit beanie. World knowledge about hats and their visual features aids in recognizing this difference.",

      "question": "Is the backpack brown in color and positioned over both shoulders with visible straps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, based solely on the visual cues, the figure indeed has a backpack that appears brown and includes straps. The visual positioning and coloring of the backpack in Image B directly align with the description of it being brown and having visible shoulder straps.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned in the same relative location on the face as in the original image, with a clear gaze direction toward the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide details about facial features like eyes or their gaze direction due to intentional blurring of the face for privacy. Recognizing visual elements in these regions is impossible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a dark-colored jacket with a visible front zipper and collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the attire in Image B reveals the figure dressed in typical explorer or adventurer clothing, not the attire typical of a dark-colored jacket with distinct zipper details. Instead, it has patterned stripes that suggest thematic adventure wear.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pants worn by the figure blue in color and consistent with the appearance of denim jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the lower leg attire of the figurine, they do not appear to be conventional denim jeans in blue. Instead, they offer the visual of explorer-style trousers, serializing adventure themes and differing from denim blue.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the figure standing upright with one hand visible near the side of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the figure is positioned standing within a box setting, but due to the style of the figurine, its hand placement and the general posture might not be as naturally described as standing upright with a visible hand alongside. The box itself confines positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the backpack's setup and straps contribute to practical positioning. Both straps are clearly shown, aligning over the figureâ€™s shoulders in a visible manner consistent with the description.",
