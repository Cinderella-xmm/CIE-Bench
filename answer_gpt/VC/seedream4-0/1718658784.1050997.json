        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the cake appears to be circular, as indicated by its round base and evenly distributed decorations forming a circular pattern. This shape is typical for cakes, commonly prepared and displayed in a round form. Therefore, combining the visual information with world knowledge about typical cake shapes, it is reasonable to conclude that the cake in Image B is round.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake features a single, prominent candle with a flame on top, situated centrally. This visual detail, combined with the common practice of placing one candle for celebratory events, leads to the conclusion that there is exactly one candle.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the cake being supported by a pedestal-like structure, which raises the cake above the surface level of the table. This setup is characteristic of cake presentations, where a stand is used to elevate the cake for better visibility. Thus, using this visual clue combined with common knowledge of cake presentation methods, the cake is indeed on a raised stand.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clearly a vase containing coral-pink fluffy flowers positioned on the left side of the cake. This is evident from the texture, color, and placement of the flowers, closely resembling typical fluffy floral arrangements found in vases. Consequently, this visual clue leads to the determination that such a vase is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays a cluster of balloons above the cake, differentiated by various colors. This is a typical decorative setup for celebratory scenes, where balloons are used as festive elements. Thus, based on these observations, there are indeed multiple balloons of different colors above the cake.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake in Image B has a decor pattern that doesn't distinctly feature small floral additions such as a purple and green decoration. The illustrative style does not lend itself to identifying precise colors due to the pop art design lacking specific detail identification. Therefore, without clear indicators, it cannot be conclusively stated that such decorations are present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there seem to be items resembling chopsticks and several small bowls that appear to contain red candies placed on the table around the cake. Such items are consistent with the visual style typical of celebratory table arrangements, where candies and utensils are visible. Therefore, based on their resemblance and contextual placement, they are present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that artistically depicts architectural elements characteristic of East Asian-style designs, such as curved roofs and ornamentation typically found in such buildings. This visual styling coincides with known features of traditional East Asian architecture. Hence, the presence of such a building style is affirmed.",
