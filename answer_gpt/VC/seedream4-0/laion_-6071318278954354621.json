    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the original woman’s facial features, including the shape of her eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the facial features, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline, are not visible or discernible because they have been obscured or blurred intentionally. Given visual cues and common practice of blurring faces in images for anonymity or privacy, it is clear that these specific features cannot be retained visually in the edited version. Therefore, without referring to Image A, the edited image does not retain these features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original woman’s skin tone preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skin tone visible in the edited image is that of the hands which are not blurred or obscured. Comparing the skin tone of these visible regions to the Image A, it is evident that the tone remains consistent in both images. Therefore, based on the visible cues in Image B, the skin tone is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the walking posture with the left leg forward and the right arm bent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the posture of the woman is quite distinct with her left leg forward and her right arm bent, which is indicative of walking. Observing these visual cues confirms the preservation of this specific walking posture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hand positions preserved, with the right hand extended forward and the left hand near the hip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the right hand is extended forward and the left hand is positioned near the hip holding an accessory. This observation aligns with the original hand positioning from Image A, indicating that the hand positions are indeed preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the specific direction of the gaze or eye orientation cannot be determined due to the blurring. Without being able to see the direction of the eyes, it is impossible to confirm if she is looking directly at the camera, hence this specific aspect is not preserved.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q6",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman's body shape and proportions, including her slender frame and leg length, are clearly visible and appear consistent with those in the original image. Observing the visual cues supports this preservation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's hair volume and curl pattern in the edited image appear to be consistent with those in the original image. Despite any partial obscuring or styling differences, these distinct characteristics of her hair are noticeably preserved based on the visible cues.",
