      "question": "Is the skateboard's distinct elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is transformed into a stained glass pattern, which alters the texture and appearance but retains the overall elongated rectangular shape with rounded ends. From the visual cues, despite the new artistic design, we can still determine that its geometric structure resembles that of a typical skateboard, and world knowledge tells us this shape is essential for its function.",

      "question": "Is the stainless steel sink's oval shape and placement on the countertop retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sink integrated into a stained glass environment. The oval shape is visible and the sink remains positioned on the countertop, typical of a kitchen sink setup. World knowledge about kitchen sinks supports the observation that despite the stained glass effect, the standard design and placement remain identifiable.",

      "question": "Are the wooden cabinets with silver handles and their arrangement retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden cabinets are visually transformed into stained glass that mimics the structure of cabinets. The stained glass design imitates cabinet shapes, but the wooden texture is changed into colorful glass patterns. While the arrangement of cabinets and presence of handles remain, the material and visual portrayal differ from Image A. With knowledge about furniture designs, we infer that the artistic interpretation retains the form without the original wood material.",

      "question": "Is the skateboard still leaning against the cabinet in the same position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The position of the skateboard in Image B matches its placement in Image A; it is still leaning against the cabinet. The stained glass pattern mimics the previous posture, indicating that the position has been retained despite the visual transformation. Common knowledge on how objects lean under gravity supports this observation.",

      "question": "Are the beige tile patterns on the floor and white tile patterns on the wall retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the tile patterns are visible, they have been creatively altered into stained glass designs. The fundamental presence of floor and wall tiles exists, yet their color and design diverge significantly from Image A's monochrome style. World knowledge helps deduce that artistic renditions often preserve layout but can substantially change aesthetics.",
