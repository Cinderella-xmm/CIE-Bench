      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues do not include the presence of an elephant. Instead, there is a plate with food, specifically a meat dish surrounded by carrot pieces. The relevant elements such as wrinkled gray skin texture, which would suggest the presence of an elephant, are not visible in this image. Therefore, the baby elephant's features cannot be retained in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the baby elephant depicted with small ears compared to its body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plate with food and lacks any depiction of an elephant. Since there is no representation of any animal, particularly an elephant, the question of ear size compared to body size does not apply to any object within the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature any depiction of an elephant or parts of an elephant. There is no visual evidence of a trunk, short or otherwise, present in the image. The image solely consists of a culinary presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicted is a close-up of a plate with meat and vegetables, which does not include any structural elements such as vertical blue metal bars. The environment drastically differs from any setting that would feature such bars.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clean plate on a presumably smooth surface which doesnâ€™t resemble any form of ground with reddish dirt as seen in the natural setting of Image A. The environment of Image B is that of a culinary context rather than an outdoor or nature-related scene.",
