      "question": "Does the edited image retain exactly three arms—one central and two lateral—arranged symmetrically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candelabra has three arms: one central vertical arm and two lateral arms. This arrangement is typically symmetrical, as it visually balances the structure. Based on the visual cues in Image B, the symmetry can be inferred from the uniform distance and shape between the arms, providing a harmonious look. This is consistent with common symmetric designs for candelabras.",

      "question": "Are the left and right arms symmetrically positioned and shaped relative to the central axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, both lateral arms are positioned at equal angles relative to the central axis, and their curves mirror each other symmetrically. This symmetry around the central arm provides a balanced aesthetic, which is a typical design choice for objects meant to be visually pleasing as symmetrical arrangements create equilibrium and balance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the base circular, flared, and adorned with a beaded or ridged edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the base of the candelabra in Image B, it appears circular with a flat surface, but it does not feature a flared form or a beaded or ridged edge. Instead, it has decorative engravings on the flat surface, which differs from the description of a flared and adorned edge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the central stem remain a tall, tapering vertical shaft connecting the base to the top arms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central stem in Image B is cylindrical and vertical, connecting the base to the arms. However, it is uniformly cylindrical without any tapering from bottom to top. A tapering shaft typically narrows as it ascends, which isn't depicted in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the arms maintain smooth, curved trajectories from the central stem to the top ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both lateral arms exhibit smooth, curved shapes as they extend from the central stem to the top ends. Such curves are visually pleasing as they create a flowing appearance that complements the overall design of the candelabra, aligning with the description of smooth, curved trajectories.",
