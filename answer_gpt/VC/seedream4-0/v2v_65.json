      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the helmet equipped with two curved horns and a central white feather-like adornment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet clearly has two curved horns extending from either side, which are symmetrical. There is no visible central white feather-like adornment seen on the helmet. The analysis focuses on the visible elements of the helmet itself in Image B.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character hold a round shield with a central boss and rivets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the character is indeed holding a round shield, which has a central boss. The shield does exhibit small circular rivets around its surface, suggesting a typical fantasy design, common to medieval or game-inspired imagery.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a sword sheathed at the character’s back with a visible hilt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character inside a snow globe, with no visible sword sheathed at the back or any visible hilt. The scene limits the view and conceals any such weapon beyond the shield, suggesting none is visible in this setup.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the shoulder pauldron feature a swirling Norse-inspired engraved pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's armor design is simplified given the chibi style, and details like swirling Norse patterns aren't evident. The focus is more on general shapes and colors rather than detailed engravings typically found on such fantasy armor.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tunic have fur trim along its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible fur trim on the tunic. The chibi keychain style simplifies the design and focuses on specific elements like the armor and snow globe scenery, not on detailed textures like fur trim.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the armor exhibit a metallic texture or finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor is designed in a chibi style and lacks the detailed metallic sheen that’s typically found on realistic armor depictions. Instead, it is rendered with solid colors and a simplified finish that fits the snow globe aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the horns on the helmet curved outward and upward, positioned symmetrically on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B definitively shows the helmet with horns curved outward and upward. These are positioned symmetrically and are characteristic of certain fantasy designs inspired by traditional Viking or Norse mythology.",
      "weight": 1,
