      "question": "Does the transformed book retain a rectangular shape with visible binding and page structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object inside the glass dome appears to be an open book, which is positioned such that it stands upright with its pages exposed. The shape and structure of the book can be observed as retaining a rectangular form, with visible pages and binding. Despite being part of a larger artistic installation, the physical attributes typical of a book are present, indicating it retains its book-like qualities.",

      "question": "Does the quill retain its feathered shaft and tapered tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a quill positioned next to the dome and within the dome, characterized by a feathered shaft and a tapered end that suggests it could be used for writing. The preservation of these features is typical of a quill pen, which traditionally has a long feather and a pointed tip used for dipping in ink.",

      "question": "Does the inkwell retain a container shape with visible dark liquid inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the inkwell is positioned in front of the book and maintains its traditional shape as a small, round container that holds ink. The presence of dark liquid inside suggests that it is indeed filled with ink, which is consistent with the purpose of an inkwell.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the book, quill, and inkwell positioned in a way that suggests they function together as writing tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the book, quill, and inkwell—situated close to each other—implies their intended function as a set of writing tools. The composition suggests a narrative where one might imagine using the quill with the ink to write in the book, even though the book is in a display. This arrangement maintains the visual suggestion of their functional relationship traditionally used in writing contexts.",

      "question": "Does the diorama retain a vintage aesthetic with dark wood, brass, and aged materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a diorama constructed with elements such as dark wood, a brass-like stand, and features aged items like the glowing desk lamp and parchment. These elements are consistent with a vintage aesthetic, characterized by a nostalgic look reminiscent of past eras, providing an old-world charm in line with vintage style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book's cover is no longer visible in its entirety due to its open position inside the glass display. Therefore, without the cover exposed, it's impossible to determine if any ornate decorative border or frame is present as in the closed state depicted in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inkwell is still observed resting on a decorative, tray-like base, which is apparent by the metallic, scalloped design underneath it. This base not only supports the inkwell but also adds to the aesthetic presentation typically used in such arrangements.",
