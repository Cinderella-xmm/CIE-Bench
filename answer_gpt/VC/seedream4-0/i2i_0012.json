      "question": "Is the subject's serene expression with the subtle smile retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's expression is not visible due to the blurred face, making it impossible to assess whether her serene expression with the subtle smile is retained. Given this limitation, we cannot determine the emotional expression from Image B.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject wearing a dark garment with a gold-trimmed neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject wearing a garment that is dark, but there is no visible gold trim along the neckline. Hence, based on the visual information provided in the edited image, the garment lacks a gold-trimmed neckline.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the subjectâ€™s arms are indeed depicted as crossed in front of her at the waist. This is consistent with the overall pose in the image considering the context of her hand positioning.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does display winding river and distant mountain elements, consistent with what is often seen in landscape depictions similar to this setting. This matches common landscape features contributing to scenic compositions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is positioned centrally, as indicated by her placement relative to the edges of the image, which suggests a focal central alignment typical for portraits.",
