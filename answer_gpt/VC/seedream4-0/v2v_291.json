      "question": "Does the edited image retain the hippo's large size and wrinkled skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hippo is depicted in a cartoonish style as part of a toy or game aesthetic, which lacks the detailed wrinkled skin texture seen in the natural, realistic depiction of Image A. The hippo's size relative to the rabbit in Image B does not reflect its natural large size, as they are styled similarly in proportion. Hence, the size and texture are not retained in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the rabbit's small size and upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rabbit is also stylized in a cartoonish manner. However, its upright ears are retained, reflecting a common characteristic of rabbits. The size relative to the hippo in Image B lacks accurate proportion due to the stylized depiction, but the particular feature of upright ears is indeed preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image keep the hippo and rabbit positioned close together and oriented towards the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both animals in Image B retain a similar proximity as seen in Image A, positioned side by side and oriented towards the viewer as part of the packaging display. This similarity in orientation is consistent with the viewer engagement aspect from the original depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo and rabbit are designed with expressions typical of friendly or neutral cartoon toysâ€”non-threatening and calm, similar to the calm demeanor observed in the realistic depiction of Image A. Their expressions and postures suggest tranquility, retaining the calmness of the original scene.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain earthy tones that reflect the natural environment of the hippo and rabbit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image adopts a vibrant and artificial color scheme that is typical of toy aesthetics, deviating from the earthy and natural tones observed in Image A. The background is stylized and does not reflect a natural environment typical for hippos and rabbits as seen in Image A, thus the earthy tones are not retained.",
