      "question": "Does the illustration retain the man's original face shape and glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the illustrated version of the man. He appears with a blurred face but still shows a head shape that is consistent with wearing glasses. From the visual analysis, features such as glasses traditionally have a distinct shape and may appear in illustrations to add character continuity. Without the need for explicit viewing of Image A, common sense suggests that such distinct character elements would be maintained for consistency between real and illustrated versions.",

      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the tie of the man bears a distinctive pattern. When analyzing the illustration in Image B, the same patterned tie appears almost identical to that in Image A. This suggests a purposeful choice to maintain specific clothing details to ensure character recognition between real and illustrated depictions.",

      "question": "Is the checkered pattern on the suit jacket retained in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an illustration where the suit jacket features a checkered pattern. In depicting characters, retaining unique clothing patterns like a checkered jacket helps in maintaining a recognizable style specific to the individual. Therefore, using common knowledge of retaining identifiable clothing features in illustrations, it's clear the checkered pattern has been purposefully included.",

      "question": "Is the striped dress shirt visible and consistent beneath the suit in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the graphic style of the illustration, beneath the suit appears a striped shirt, similar in presentation to Image A. The visual legality of carrying over such details between real and illustrated forms ensures character consistency. Using logical reasoning based on consistent depiction conventions, the shirt remains visible and similar.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the short-cropped hairstyle retained in the man's illustrated appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a continued line illustration representing what would be a short-cropped hairstyle. This matches the typical approach of maintaining character-specific traits like hairstyle in illustrations for continuity and recognizability. Since the hairstyle is generally a defining feature that carries over, it is reasonable to conclude that the short-cropped style is kept.",
