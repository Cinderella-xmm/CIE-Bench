      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters maintain a rounded, oval shape and a surface appearance that is similar to a potato. This is indicated by the presence of small spots or blemishes that mimic the texture commonly found on potato skin. This visual cue, combined with common world knowledge of how a potato appears, supports the conclusion that the characters still possess a potato-like shape and texture.",

      "question": "Is the potato character in the first panel still depicted as exercising with dumbbells and wearing a green headband?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character in the first panel is engaging in a running exercise and not using dumbbells. The visual indicates the character is indeed wearing a green headband, but the specific action of exercising with dumbbells is not present. Instead, it appears to be in a gym setting, common for various kinds of workouts. Comparing to Image A, which shows a character holding dumbbells in a relaxed manner, Image B does not depict this specific activity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the second panel shows a character inside a cardboard box, which is graphically illustrated as a cozy space with a pillow, suggesting sleep. This aligns with common depictions of comfort and rest, like a pet or small creature using a box as a makeshift bed, indicating the character is sleeping.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the third panel portrays a character sitting at a table with apparent food items, including a bowl and chopsticks. The position and presence of these objects suggest the character is in the act of eating, consistent with common dining settings where individuals are seated with food in front of them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first panel shows a character in a gym environment, which suggests exercise. The second panel displays a character resting in a cardboard box, indicative of sleeping. The third panel shows a character seated with food-like items, implying eating. Each panel distinctly represents one of these activities through contextual visual cues that align with common knowledge of these actions.",
