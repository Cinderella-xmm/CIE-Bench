      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure retain the large hind legs characteristic of a kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure inside the box shows a kangaroo-inspired design with exaggerated features typical of chibi-style figures. The hind legs are depicted as smaller and stylized rather than large and robust, as seen in actual kangaroos. World knowledge of Funko Pop figures, which generally present simplified and stylized versions of their subjects, helps clarify that the design prioritizes cuteness over accurate anatomical proportions.",

      "question": "Is the long tail of the kangaroo preserved in the Funko Pop figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Funko Pop figure inside the box, featuring a kangaroo-style design. Observing the figure, it indeed includes a tail, albeit stylized, which is consistent with the world knowledge that kangaroos have distinctive long tails used for balance and hopping. The tailâ€™s presence acknowledges this significant anatomical trait irrespective of the simplified design.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box include a pouch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box is observed closely, revealing a small pouch depicted on its front. Notably, kangaroo pouches are critical for carrying young and are often featured in stylized representations of kangaroos. This relates to the understanding that even simplified character designs can incorporate essential traits to maintain recognizable identity.",

      "question": "Is the Funko Pop figure primarily colored brown to reflect the original kangaroo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure inside the box in Image B is predominantly brown in color, aligning with the coloring of the real kangaroo beside it. The brown color choice maintains the representation of the kangaroo's natural appearance. This decision reflects the design ethos of Funko Pop figures, which often use color schemes to evoke the essence of their real-world counterparts.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the hopping-related elements (hind legs and tail) depicted in the chibi-style figure inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure inside the box, as seen in Image B, includes both hind legs and a tail, although their scale and detail are reduced due to the chibi-style simplification. These elements are critical for a kangaroo's hopping motion in reality, and their presence in the figure alludes to these essential anatomical features, which are incorporated to convey the essence of a kangaroo within a stylized depiction.",
