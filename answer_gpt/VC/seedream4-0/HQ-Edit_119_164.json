      "question": "Are the flat-topped acacia trees visible in the background, maintaining their characteristic silhouette and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes multiple flat-topped acacia trees, which are spaced similarly and maintain the traditional silhouette that acacia trees are known for in the African savanna. Their characteristic umbrella-like shape is apparent in both the silhouette and the arrangement of trees, contributing to the overall savanna atmosphere of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the tall, golden-brown savanna grass present throughout the foreground and midground, matching the original texture and density?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground and midground display the tall, golden-brown savanna grass, which is consistent with the texture and density seen in typical savanna landscapes. The grass contributes to the natural scene by providing a realistic and immersive foreground and midground detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky display a continuous gradient from warm orange near the horizon to deep red and purple at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B meticulously shows a gradient sky transitioning from a warm orange near the horizon, extending into deeper reds and a hint of purple towards the top. This smooth color transition is typical of a sunset and enhances the dramatic visual.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the horizon line clearly visible and straight, dividing the sky from the savanna landscape at approximately one-third up the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line is straight and clearly divides the sky from the savanna landscape, positioned around one-third from the bottom of the image. This placement is a classic compositional technique in landscape photography, ensuring balance and focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting consistent with a low-angle sunset, producing warm highlights on the upper surfaces of the elephant and grass, and casting long shadows behind the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to be illuminated by low-angle sunlight, as indicated by the warm highlights visible on the top surfaces of the elephant and the grass. This lighting creates long shadows that are typical of a setting or rising sun scenario, enhancing the realism of a sunset scene.",

      "question": "Is the elephant positioned centrally in the frame, facing directly toward the viewer with its body aligned vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is centrally positioned in the frame, facing straight towards the viewer. Its body alignment is vertical, making it the focal point of the composition which aids in directing attention and balance.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there no visible water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals in the background beyond the acacia trees and grass?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows only acacia trees and grass in the background, without any water bodies, rocky outcrops, or other animals. This isolation of specific elements maintains the focus on the elephant and the characteristic savanna setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass in the foreground depicts individual blades, each varying slightly in length and direction, thus providing a natural and rich texture typical of tall savanna grasses. This detailed representation enhances the authenticity and depth of the scene.",
