    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a large, circular, reddish celestial body located in the upper left portion of the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the sky showcases a prominent circular figure. This red-hued object resembles a celestial body such as a sun or moon. Its positioning and shape, aligned with common knowledge of celestial depictions in art, allows for confirmation as a large celestial body.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a prominent mountain range with snow-covered peaks spanning the background behind the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion of the embroidery showcases a series of triangular shapes with a lighter-toned stitching, indicative of snowy peaks. This portrayal of a mountain range is traditional in landscape art and can be inferred as prominent snow-covered mountains.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, reflective body of water occupying the central foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a swirling area of blue and white thread towards the bottom center, suggesting movement and reflection like a river or stream, not a still or large body of water like a lake in typical landscape imagery. Therefore, it does not confirm a large reflective lake in the central foreground.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there clusters of red-colored trees lining both banks of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, groupings of red vertical lines suggest clusters of trees on either side of the water body. The visual portrayal implies a balanced placement alongside the water, despite the artistic medium's abstraction.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface of the lake reflect the red moon and the snow-capped mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a flowing water representation with distinct thread patterns that do not indicate specific reflections. While there is a blue depiction of a body of water, the embroidery style generally doesn't capture detailed reflections like those of a moon or mountains.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible rocks and patches of snow along the lake’s edge in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, textured stitching creates patterns on the water’s edge that resemble abstract representations of rocks and potentially patches of snow, given the use of contrasting colors and raised threading indicative of surface variation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the moon positioned above the mountain range and the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrayal of the large reddish circle is above the area suggesting snowy mountains and water. Its placement follows typical sky and celestial body depictions, assumedly above land and water elements in landscape compositions.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
