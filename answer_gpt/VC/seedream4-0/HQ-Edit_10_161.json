      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is made up of a mosaic of variously colored tiles, including orange, blue, and yellow, forming a patchwork pattern unlike the geometric pattern of orange-brown diamonds on a turquoise blue background seen in Image A. The use of tiles in the clothing is a distinct characteristic not present in the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
