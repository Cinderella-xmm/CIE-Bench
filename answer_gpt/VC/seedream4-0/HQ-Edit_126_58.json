    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan-shaped object still curved in an elegant S-shape, extending upward and backward from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original swan sculpture from Image A has been replaced by a perfume bottle shaped like a swan. This new object has a different design featuring a symmetrical perfume bottle with angel wings attached to the sides and a stopper on top. From the visual cues in Image B, the neck of the swan is no longer visible, as itâ€™s been altered into a bottle, losing the curved S-shape characteristic of a swan's neck.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pink berry-like accents visible on the evergreen sprigs surrounding the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited swan bottle retains the pink berry-like accents along with evergreen sprigs clearly visible at the base, similar in placement to Image A. The visual elements demonstrate continuity as the pink and red accents are still present around the base of the bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a white snowflake-shaped ornament located near the base of the swan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the snowflake ornament visible in Image A is still present around the base of the newly edited perfume bottle. This indicates that despite alterations to the main subject, the snowflake ornament continues to be part of the composition.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the swan/bottle resting on a textured, snow-covered surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base underneath the perfume bottle in Image B appears to be a textured, snow-covered surface just as in Image A. This implies that the snow and the surface texture have been preserved during the editing process.",

    {

      "question": "Are there blurred figures of people walking in the background under strings of colorful, glowing lights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, similar to Image A, there are indeed blurred figures under strings of colorful lights which create an ambiance of a festive scene. The repetition of these elements in both images shows consistency.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the head of the swan-shaped object oriented toward the left side of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original swan's head is replaced entirely by the design of a perfume bottle stopper, which is centrally positioned and does not have a discernible orientation like a swan's head. Thus, it doesn't face the left or any specific direction.",
