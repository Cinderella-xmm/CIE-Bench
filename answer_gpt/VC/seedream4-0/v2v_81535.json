      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl is visible and retains its white porcelain appearance with a noticeable blue floral design on the interior, consistent with the features seen in the original Image A.

      "question": "Is the orange curry sauce still visible, coating the transformed elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange curry sauce is present underneath the transformed elements, such as dragon eggs, and appears to be partially coating them. The sauce's visibility in the image suggests that some aspects of the original dish's sauce have been retained.",

    {

      "question": "Are the transformed elements (dragon eggs and dragons) arranged within the bowl in a manner consistent with the original dish's placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation includes dragon eggs and miniature dragons positioned within the bowl. Analyzing Image A, the chicken pieces are arranged within the bowl, suggesting that the placement of elements—whether it's chicken or fantasy objects—is consistent. The new elements replace the chicken but maintain the bowl's central arrangement as seen in the original image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains visible elements such as kitchen items and parts of a countertop visible in the background, similar to those in Image A. The items such as bottles and containers in Image B suggest continuity and establish that the background setting has not been altered.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange curry sauce exhibits a shiny and glossy surface, notably on the parts that remain uncovered by other elements. This characteristic is similar to the sauce's texture in Image A, suggesting that the glossy quality of the sauce is maintained.",
