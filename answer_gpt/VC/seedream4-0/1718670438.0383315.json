    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot retain its dome-shaped head with three evenly spaced circular porthole eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot maintains a dome-shaped head where the three circular porthole eyes are still present and spaced evenly around the dome. This conclusion is drawn from the visible structure of the head where these features are clearly observable, consistent with typical robot designs that utilize such eye configurations for symmetry and functionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent chest panel still present, clearly displaying the internal gear system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot with a transparent chest panel that allows visibility into the internal gear system. This is determined by observing the clear material in the chest area, through which intricate metallic gear systems can be seen, a common design feature for showcasing mechanical intricacies in robots.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do both arms retain their segmented, piston-style joint construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's arms appear to consist of multiple segments connected by cylindrical joints, resembling a piston configuration. This observation is based on the visual inspection of the arm structure, where the construction pattern includes sections characterized by differential widths and visible joint areas, indicative of a piston-like assembly.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both feet equipped with exactly five claw-like toes each?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays both of the robot's feet with claw-like toes; however, neither foot appears to have five distinct claws. The form of the toes and their count are essential for this determination. From visual inspection in Image B, both feet have fewer than five toes, which signifies a design alteration from what is typically expected.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there five distinct spires and antennae on top of the robot’s head, including one central and four lateral ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are multiple protrusions visible on top of the robot's head; however, the exact count and configuration of these pieces do not seem to match the prescribed five distinct spires, including one central and four lateral. The design seems to differ slightly in number and distribution.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are multiple interlocking gears of different sizes visible through the transparent chest panel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible internal structure through the robot's transparent chest panel in Image B shows a collection of variously sized gears. This reflects a complex gear system, an assessment derived from observing the gears' differing dimensions, shapes, and overlapping configurations, typical of intricate robotic or steampunk designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the robot maintain its original oxidized bronze and copper color scheme with visible wear and aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the robot with a color scheme dominated by bronze and copper hues, enhanced with apparent aging effects such as slight tarnishing and texture consistent with wear. This conclusion stems from the visible patina and coloration details that match typical metal oxidation and aging in similar materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the rivets and mechanical fasteners visible along the joints and edges of the robot’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visible rivets and mechanical fasteners are observed along the robot's joints and its body edges, which are common in maintaining structural integrity and aesthetics in mechanical designs. This is verified by the clear depiction of these elements across junctions and panel connections within the robot's construction visible in the image.",
