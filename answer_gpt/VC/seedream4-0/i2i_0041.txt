    "Question": "Q1: Do the sheep retain their interaction posture (one feeding the others) in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters resemble sheep but are anthropomorphized, with added scarves and earmuffs, instead of having realistic animal features. They stand facing the railing, mimicking a feeding posture similar to Image A, where the original sheep also face the railing appearing to be fed. This shows a retention of the interaction posture in the context of animated characters.",
