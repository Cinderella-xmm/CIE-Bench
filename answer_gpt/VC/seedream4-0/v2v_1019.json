        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character features a body that closely resembles the cylindrical shape and reddish-brown color of a hot dog, which is consistent with the original hot dogs in Image A.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s hair resembles coleslaw by including the visual texture and color variety seen in shredded cabbage. This matches the original coleslaw on the hot dogs in Image A, which has a similar mix of white, orange, and purple cabbage.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the plate is the same, featuring a decorative border with teal blue, burnt orange, and dark brown floral and scroll motifs. This indicates that the base design has retained the original plate's decorative elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is positioned on a base that appears to have been placed on the plate rather than directly derived from the plate itself. The base has a checkered pattern distinct from the floral and scroll motifs of the referred plate design, suggesting a different visual inspiration.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as a single entity designed to look like one hot dog. While the hot dogs in Image A are presented as a pair, the character in Image B does not mirror this number and is a single representation.",
