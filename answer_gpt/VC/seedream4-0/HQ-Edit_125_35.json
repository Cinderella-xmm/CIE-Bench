    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the red velvet cushion with visible quilted texture present beneath the saxophone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a saxophone, there is a serpent with intricate metallic scales, positioned on a red velvet cushion that shows a rich, quilted texture. The presence of the cushion is evident as it serves as the platform on which the serpent is nested.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a thin gold trim running along the outer edge of the red cushion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red velvet cushion beneath the serpent features a thin gold trim along its edges. This detailing adds a touch of elegance and is visually apparent in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lighting source positioned above the saxophone, creating a bright central glow that fades into darkness toward the edges of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is positioned above the serpent, casting illumination directly on it and the cushion. This creates a central glow that diminishes in intensity as it moves toward the edges, similar to a spotlight effect. The reasoning process involves recognizing this spotlight styling as common in emphasizing a subject.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the saxophone (or transformed serpent) positioned diagonally across the cushion, extending from the lower left to the upper right of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed serpent coils from the lower right corner toward the upper left corner. This positioning differs from a diagonal alignment extending from lower left to upper right, typically used in imagery for dynamic composition.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly dark, with no visible objects or textures other than the spotlight glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area surrounding the main subjects is completely dark, without any discernible objects or textures, except for the focused glow of the spotlight highlighting the serpent and cushion. This creates a dramatic effect that is common in artistic presentations to emphasize the focal subject.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the transformed serpent retain a highly reflective, metallic surface with visible highlights and specular reflections consistent with polished brass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent has a metallic appearance with sections that exhibit highlights and reflections similar to polished metal surfaces. While not identical to polished brass specifically, it retains the reflective and glossy quality characteristic of metallic objects.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
