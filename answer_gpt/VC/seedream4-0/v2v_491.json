      "question": "Does the bear retain its brown fur texture and color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the bear appears as a figurine with textures indicative of a stylized representation rather than natural fur. Unlike Image A's natural brown fur, Image B shows a smoother, artificial surface consistent with a chibi or toy form. Therefore, the bear does not retain its original fur texture and color.",

      "question": "Is the bear depicted in an upright sitting posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear clearly maintains an upright sitting posture. This pose is typical for chibi or toy representations, and combined with the visible pose, confirms the bear is indeed sitting upright.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the backpack retains a blue color similar to Image A and has black straps. The consistency in color and design between the images confirms the backpack preserves these features.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the backpack with visible black straps and a buckle design akin to Image A. These components appear functional and unchanged, indicating they are intact.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's bear, reimagined as a chibi figure, does not visibly retain its original facial features such as dark eyes and black nose, focusing more on a simplified stylistic approach rather than realistic details.",
