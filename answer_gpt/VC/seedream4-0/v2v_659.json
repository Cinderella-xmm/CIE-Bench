      "question": "Are the large, round brown eyes present and positioned symmetrically in the center of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a cartoonish figure resembling a 'chibi' style where large, round eyes are a typical feature. While the specific face is blurred in the main subject, the chibi character in the foreground displays these characteristic eyes, suggesting intentional stylistic choices rather than realistic human features. Hence, without explicit facial features on the blurred face, a specific comparison cannot be made, leading to the assessment that the original subject does not display such animated properties.",

      "question": "Is there a crown-like accessory present on the top of the head, resembling the original tiara in form and placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a crown-like accessory sits on top of the head similar to the one in Image A. The tiara is similarly styled, featuring ornate designs typical of a crown or tiara, emphasizing the royal theme apparent in the images. This is evident from the visual placement, size, and overall appearance of the accessory which closely resembles the crown worn in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the face retain a soft oval shape with a small nose and a slight upward curve of the lips forming a gentle smile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the blurred nature of the main face in Image B, these details about the facial structure cannot be directly determined. However, the chibi figure presents these features with a small nose and a quintessential smile rather than the main blurred face, adhering to the style typical of cartoon characters. The face of the human subject lacks visible structural details preventing specific confirmations of its shape, smile, or nose features.",

      "question": "Is the skin tone light and fair with a natural pinkish blush visible on the cheeks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of the human subject's complexion are obscured. However, assessing the chibi character, it features a light skin tone, characteristic of the style, with added facial color like a pinkish blush typically used to suggest warmth and life. Nonetheless, due to the lack of clarity in the main person's features and complexion, discerning such specifics on the actual subject is speculative.",

      "question": "Are both ears visible and positioned naturally on the sides of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject's left ear is visible and positioned naturally, just like in Image A. The chibi figure, though more stylized, also presents ear placement typical of human anatomy despite the absence of realism. Therefore, based on visual observation, the human subject in Image B appears consistent with expected anatomical placement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the subject with hair that is brown in color, styled in soft waves cascading around where the facial space is positioned, similar to Image A. This hairstyle is consistent with textures and styling that suggest gentle waves, which are visible even though the facial detail is blurred.",
