      "question": "Is the winding stone path composed of irregular flat stones leading upward toward the central structure present in the same location and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure is now a large tree with ethereal leaves instead of a castle, yet the path leading to it bears similarities. The stone path is indeed composed of irregular flat stones, similar to Image A; however, its ultimate orientation towards the central object is shifted, as it leads to the tree instead of the castle. The comparison indicates that while the path's materiality is similar, its end orientation differs due to the change in the central focus.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the large, scattered rock formations visible along the grassy slope at the base of the structure preserved in their original positions and sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the foundational rocky forms persist around the tree. However, their arrangement is altered compared to Image A. The transformation of the central structure from a castle to a tree naturally influences the base's physical formation and layout, leading to changes in the positioning and size of rock formations.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tall, leafy trees forming a natural border on both the left and right edges of the image still present, maintaining their original height, density, and positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tall, leafy trees are highly prominent, creating a natural border akin to Image A. They frame the scene on both edges, which implies that they are retained in height and density. Given the focal change from a castle to a tree, minor positional adjustments may exist, yet the overall boundary composition displays similarity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky above the castle still depicted with soft daylight and scattered white clouds against a pale blue background, preserving the original lighting quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no castle, but the sky above the tree presents a pale blue atmosphere with white, scattered clouds under soft daylight settings similar to Image A. Despite the shift from castle to tree, the lighting nuances are maintained, offering qualitative visual continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the hillside beneath the castle still gently sloped upward from the foreground, covered in green grass and supporting the stone path and rocks in their original configuration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a hillside beneath the tree, aligned with the characteristics observed in Image A beneath the castle. While both display green grass covering a gently sloped terrain, differing central features imply variation in surrounding elements like the path and rocks, leading to alterations in configuration.",
