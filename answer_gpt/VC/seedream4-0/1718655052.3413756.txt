    "Question": "Q1: Are the dog's large, round, black eyes clearly visible and positioned symmetrically on the face?",
    "explanation": "In image B, which is a LEGO model of a dog, the eyes are represented by black LEGO pieces, which are commonly used to symbolize eyes in LEGO figures. These pieces are positioned symmetrically, typical of a front-facing canine structure. The roundness and uniformity in size and placement indicate that they are intended to represent large, round eyes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the dog's black nose clearly present and centered on the snout?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the nose of the dog is visibly represented by a central black LEGO piece positioned at the tip of the snout. This is a typical representation of a dog's nose in LEGO construction, where the central placement on the snout is intended to mimic natural canine anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the dog's mouth open, revealing a pink tongue?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the dog's mouth is represented by a single red LEGO piece positioned below the nose. This piece simulates the appearance of an open mouth with a tongue, even though the tongue itself is not separately identifiable beyond the implication provided by the red color.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are both ears floppy and positioned symmetrically on either side of the head?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the ears are depicted with LEGO pieces that extend from each side of the head, lying flat or floppy as represented by the horizontal orientation of the pieces. This symmetrical placement suggests floppy ears on either side of the dog's head.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a dark collar with a visible silver-colored metal ring around the dog's neck?",
    "explanation": "In image B, a black circular LEGO piece simulates a collar around the neck of the dog. However, there is no visible silver-colored metal ring present, as the LEGO structure does not incorporate metallic or colored rings for such a detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the hat positioned on the dog’s head with two white pom-poms visible on either side?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the dog's hat is represented by a series of LEGO pieces that construct a head-covering structure. This is topped with a single pom-pom rather than two on either side, which is explicitly visible at the top of the hat structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the scarf wrapped around the dog’s neck, forming a visible loop or knot at the front?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the scarf is illustrated by LEGO pieces placed around the neck area of the dog model. A specific piece simulates a hanging portion, suggesting that it is wrapped around the neck, although no loop or distinct knot is visually modeled beyond this hanging representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Is the dog facing directly toward the camera with a slight upward tilt of the head?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the LEGO dog is oriented front-facing towards the observer, akin to being directed towards a camera. However, the pieces do not portray any clear upward tilt of the head, as the structure is built to display a flat, frontal view typical of LEGO sculptures without head-tilt articulation.",
    "answer": "No"
