    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the mustache present and shaped in a way that matches the original image, with a curved, thick form extending from both sides of the upper lip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no mustache present. The chibi figure is designed simplistically and does not include detailed facial hair like a mustache, which is a notable feature in Image A where a mustache is prominently displayed. The comparison shows a clear absence of this element in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hair retain its wild, voluminous, and unevenly distributed white appearance, particularly with strands extending outward from the sides and top of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a chibi figure with similarly wild and voluminous white hair extending outward from the head, mimicking the messy hairstyle shown in the original Image A. This style is characteristic of people depicted with a disheveled or eccentric appearance, as is iconic in both images.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there vertical black stripes running down the front of the sweater, matching the pattern seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sweater of the chibi figure does feature vertical black stripes, which aligns with the pattern suggested by Image A. This indicates an attention to preserving some elements of the original depiction's clothing style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure does not show a visible shirt collar beneath the sweater's neckline. In contrast, Image A has a visible light-colored shirt collar, which is not replicated in the chibi version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eyes, nose, and forehead lines maintain their original relative positions and shapes, such as the horizontal creases on the forehead and the oval shape of the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure possesses simple, button-like eyes without a visible nose or forehead lines. This is a significant departure from the more complex facial features seen in Image A, which includes creases and detailed eye shapes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure's sweater does include ribbed textures along the neckline and shoulder area, which offers a similar tactile appearance to Image A. This consistency in clothing texture highlights an effort to maintain certain original design elements.",
