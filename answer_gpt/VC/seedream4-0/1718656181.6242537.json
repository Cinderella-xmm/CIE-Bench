      "question": "Is the mushroom cloud shape (with a distinct stem and cap) present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork clearly stylizes an explosion as a mushroom cloud with a distinct stem and cap. This shape is iconic for nuclear or large-scale explosions and is visually represented in a vivid, graphic style using bright colors and outlined forms. Based on these cues and knowledge of typical visual representations of explosions, the mushroom cloud shape is present.",

      "question": "Is there a landmass beneath the explosion in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the explosion, there is a section depicted in a darker color which represents a landmass, indicated by its relative position and separation from the water depicted with straighter horizontal lines. Recognizing this common illustration technique, the area under the explosion does depict a landmass.",

      "question": "Does the sea surround the island in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sea is depicted using blue and green hues and surrounds the darker landmass on most sides visible in the artwork. This can be inferred from the commonly understood representation of land separated by water in artistic depictions, ensuring that the depiction of the sea encloses the landmass.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stylized palm trees as part of its foreground, illustrated with green colors and distinctive shapes, positioned in front of the ocean and landmass. This depiction uses basic but recognizable elements of palm trees, a common graphic representation for such environments, indicating their presence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion's base directly aligns with the landmass, signifying that it is positioned over it. This alignment is emphasized by the center of the explosion's stem rooted in the depiction of the island, commonly used to indicate the origin point of explosions in illustrations.",
