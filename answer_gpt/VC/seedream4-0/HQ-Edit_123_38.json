    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the balance beam made of wood with visible wear and chipped paint?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balance beam appears to be made of wood, with a texture that suggests wear and chipped paint. This is an artistic interpretation, as the beam takes on a stylized form with painted details to give the impression of surface wear.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gymnast maintain a handstand with her body arched backward and legs lifted vertically above her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the gymnast in a handstand position, with her body arched backward and legs lifted above, in a curved artistic style. This position aligns with common gymnastic postures depicting contortion and flexibility.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the leotard divided into silver upper body and blue lower body with a gradient transition and sparkles along the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a leotard with a distinct division between silver and blue sections. The gradient transition and sparkles along the spine are creatively applied, enhancing the visual appeal through contrasting colors.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s hair styled in a tight bun secured with a blue hair tie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gymnast's hair in Image B is shown as a silhouette where the hair is styled in a tight bun, implied by the shape. The use of a blue hair tie is a detail that reflects continuity in color coordination.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible chalk marks on the balance beam beneath the gymnast’s hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B doesn't show any specific chalk marks. Instead, stylized textures are present, but these don't directly suggest chalk marks typically seen on gymnastic equipment.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small stud earring visible on the gymnast’s left ear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the silhouette style, any details such as earrings are obscured, and there is no visible sign of a stud earring on the gymnast's ear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the gymnast’s face turned sideways with her eyes looking downward toward the beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gymnast's face in Image B is shown in silhouette form, making it difficult to discern specific orientation or direction of gaze, unlike Image A where facial features might be more visible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the gymnast’s hands placed flat on top of the beam, supporting her body in a handstand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the gymnast's hands curved around the beam rather than flat on top. This artistic choice differs from real-world handstand support positions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic style does not include gymnastic grips; instead, the hands are shown in blue without additional distinguishing features such as gymnastic grips.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features artistic representation with abstract backgrounds, and while there are hints of audience and lights in the distance, they are not directly detailed as blurred tiered seating like in typical stadium scenes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    }
