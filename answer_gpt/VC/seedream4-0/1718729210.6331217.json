      "question": "Is the pumpkin face with glowing orange eyes and a jagged grin present on the scarecrow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow's head appears to be transformed into a lantern with a candle inside it, topped by a crow, instead of featuring a pumpkin face with glowing orange eyes and a jagged grin, which could have been present based on Halloween themes. This indicates there is no visible pumpkin face with such characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the scarecrow wear a conical hat with a wide brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow does not have a conical hat; instead, it has a lantern head with a crow resting on top. A conical hat with a wide brim suggests a witch or wizard-like hat, which is absent in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scarecrow standing upright with arms extended outward and legs ending in claw-like feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow is indeed standing upright with arms extended outward. However, its legs do not end in claw-like feet but instead stand in a box marked with Halloween imagery, such as pumpkins. This indicates the feet are not explicitly claw-like.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a blue cloth shirt tied around the scarecrowâ€™s torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the scarecrow wrapped in what appears to be a dark, possibly rain-coated material, with lights, and not a visible blue cloth shirt. This suggests the absence of a distinct blue cloth shirt tied around the torso in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background scene featuring a moonlit sky, distant mountains, and a harvested wheat field present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a background that features a night sky with starry decorations, distant mountains silhouetted against the horizon, and a field of what appears to be harvested wheat, matching the described scene in a typical rural setting.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a bird flying above and to the left of the scarecrow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bird can be seen positioned above and to the left of the scarecrow, flying in the night sky, contributing to the eerie and atmospheric presence of the scene. This position helps to affirm the observation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the pumpkin face emit a visible glow from within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lantern instead of a pumpkin face, with a candle emitting light from inside as the scarecrow's head. The absence of a traditional pumpkin face negates the feature of an internal glow from a pumpkin. Therefore, any glow is from a candle, not a pumpkin face.",
