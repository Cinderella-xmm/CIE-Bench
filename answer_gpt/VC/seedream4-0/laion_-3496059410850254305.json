      "question": "Is the Fender logo visible on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock of the guitar includes the design elements common to a Fender guitar, such as the tuning pegs and shape. The logo, usually located near the top of the headstock, is typically a clear visual marker. However, the headstock is shown from an angle where the logo is not visibly clear, but based on characteristics and knowledge of Fender guitars, the headstock likely bears the logo. In Image A, which clearly shows the headstock, the Fender logo is visible. Therefore, for Image B, benefiting from Image A's clarity, we can infer the logo is present but not visible due to the angle.",

      "question": "Are there exactly six strings running from the bridge to the tuning pegs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the guitar closely, it visually suggests the presence of six strings. These strings are evenly spaced from the bridge to the tuning pegs, consistent with a standard acoustic guitar. Comparing with Image A, where six strings are clearly present, confirms this configuration as typical for such guitars.",

      "question": "Is there a cutaway on the upper right side of the guitar body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the guitar and includes a cutaway on the guitar's body, evident on the player's left, which corresponds to the upper right side when considering the guitar itself. This cutaway allows for easier access to higher frets. Image A also shows the same cutaway feature in the same position, confirming this observation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soundhole is centrally positioned on the guitar body, a common characteristic of acoustic guitars. This central placement allows for balanced sound projection. Image A similarly shows a centrally located soundhole, consistent with typical acoustic guitar design.",

      "question": "Does the neck extend directly from the body to the headstock without significant deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the guitar's neck extends in a straight line from the body to the headstock, typical for standard acoustic guitars. This alignment is essential for maintaining string tension and playability. Image A displays the same straight configuration, confirming no significant deviation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the headstock generally with tuning pegs in a typical arrangement for six-string guitars: three on each side. This is a conventional design seen on many guitars for balanced tuning capability. Image A clearly details this setup, confirming the presence of three tuning pegs on each side.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's guitar exhibits the typical dreadnought shape, which is known for a large, rounded lower bout providing robust sound projection and a cutaway on the upper right for access to higher frets as confirmed visually. This matches with Image A's depiction of the guitar, validating the classic dreadnought shape observation.",
