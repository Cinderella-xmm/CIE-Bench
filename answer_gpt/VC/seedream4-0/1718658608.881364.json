    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict exactly eight arms extending from the central head mass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited sculpture shows a central head mass from which the arms extend. By counting, there are discernible segments that approximate eight extensions or arms, indicating the presence of exactly eight arms from the central part. Combining visual information with world knowledge of typical octopus anatomy helps confirm this.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a distinct, rounded central head mass from which all arms originate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the sculpture features a clearly defined, rounded central mass at the top. This structure is where the arms are attached and extend from. This setup is typical for octopus representations and matches common anatomical features.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms exhibit a flowing, undulating arrangement that mirrors the wave patterns of the original ocean scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the sculpture are arranged in a manner that creates an undulating and flowing aesthetic; however, they are positioned on a flat surface, making it difficult to directly mimic the wave-like patterns seen in the ocean scene from Image A. The design seems more static and structured compared to the dynamic waves.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible surface textures on the sculptures that mimic the original skin's ridges and suction cup patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the sculpture in Image B is smooth and features a scale-like texture, lacking any visible mimicry of the original octopus's ridged skin or suction cup patterns. The visual cues indicate a more decorative, stylized approach rather than a naturalistic imitation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sculpture maintain the same general silhouette and proportional relationship between the head and arms as the original octopus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image B shows an edited sculpture with a stylized, compact design where the head and arms have a different proportional relationship. The arms are shorter and the body is more round, contrasting with the elongated, natural proportions of the original octopus in Image A.",
