    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the embossed dragons with detailed scales, claws, and flowing bodies clearly visible on the body of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object displays a dragon design as part of the embellishment on its surface. Analyzing this, the dragons are indeed detailed with scales, claws, and flowing bodies, which are distinct and visible. The level of detail suggests an embossed pattern that highlights these features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the object textured with raised relief patterns, particularly around the dragon motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the surface of the object in Image B, it exhibits patterns that suggest a raised relief, especially around the dragon motifs. The detail in the patterns visible in the image confirms that they have a textured quality, indicative of an embossed or relief design.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a distinct spout extending from the side of the object, shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a spout; however, it does not resemble a dragon's head with an open mouth as it did in Image A. Instead, the spout is simpler, lacking the distinctive dragon head detail seen previously. The changes focus on the inscription 'Dragonâ€™s Delight', which is consistent from the handle to the spout.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the object retain a silver-colored, highly reflective metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B appears to have a metallic surface that maintains a silver color, reflecting light with a high degree of reflectivity. This is consistent with what one would expect from a highly polished metallic surface, thus confirming its properties.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the object positioned upright on a flat surface, such as a wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly positioned upright and is placed on what appears to be a flat surface. The background and the visible surface beneath the object suggest that this is a wooden table, consistent with its setting, and corroborating its upright stance.",
