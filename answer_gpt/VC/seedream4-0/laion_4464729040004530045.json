      "question": "Is the woman in the edited image positioned in a three-quarter profile view, facing to the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman is viewed from an angle where we can see most of her right side, including her right cheek, ear, and part of her nose, indicating a three-quarter profile view. Combining world knowledge, a three-quarter profile usually involves seeing more side than front, but still part of the front of the body. This position faces her to the right from the viewer's perspective, but covered up to in an angle counterclockwise. Thus, she is facing to the right in the image rather than left.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman’s head tilted downward in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, the woman’s head seems aligned or level with her shoulders and neck, suggesting a straight head position without any downward tilt. The way the jewelry rests naturally around her neck and shoulders supports this observation, as a downward tilt would alter their placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the woman’s arms positioned at her sides in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman's arms are visible at her sides, as evidenced by both hands being at waist-level and in line with her body. This is typical for an arm position where the arms rest by her sides. Combining world knowledge, at-the-side positioning is natural, complementing her upright posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman have white nail polish on her fingernails in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Through evaluation, it is evident that the woman's fingernails in the edited image are styled with a dark shade rather than white. This conclusion stems from the visible contrast to her lighter lace gloves, indicating a darker polish color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the visual cues indicate that the woman’s pose and the visible ear orientation reveal she is facing towards the right from the viewer’s perspective. In a three-quarter profile, as assessed in previous inquiries, she would be more turned to the right side than the left.",
