    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image preserve the multi-tiered, stepped gable structure of the church, with at least three distinct roof levels stacked vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure visible is a crystal or ice-like tower rather than a church with a multi-tiered, stepped gable structure. The visual cues suggest an entirely different architectural form without distinct roof levels. Therefore, based on visual information from Image B, and understanding of architectural structures, the multi-tiered, stepped gable structure is not preserved.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible carved wooden patterns along the eaves and gables of the church, even if overlaid with glowing runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a crystalline structure decorated with glowing runes, lacking any wooden material or carved patterns. The architectural cues of Image B suggest polished surfaces rather than wood carving. Hence, Image B does not show carved wooden patterns typical of a church.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cross-shaped finial still present at the very top of the central spire, even if partially obscured by glowing celestial orbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image reveals an ice tower with a radiant orb at its peak instead of a cross-shaped finial. Visual cues suggest a shift to fantasy elements (crystals/orbs), indicating the absence of a traditional church finial.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there horn-like or antler-shaped projections extending from the corners of the roof sections, especially at the top tiers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a smooth, sleek crystalline tower devoid of any horn-like or antler-shaped projections that would protrude from roof sections. The fantasy ice tower does not employ such traditional structural elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a stone-paved pathway leading directly from the foreground to the main entrance of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a pathway in the foreground leading towards the crystalline tower, matching the stone-paved pathway that would direct to the church's entrance in the original image's setting. Thus, despite the editing, the pathway's presence and direction are unchanged.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined arched doorway located at the center of the front facade, accessible via a short flight of steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a crystalline formation without an identifiable arched doorway typical of architectural facades like churches. Thus, the presence of a doorway via steps is absent, differing from traditional entrance cues in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there evergreen trees with snow on their branches and clusters of pink or purple flowering shrubs in the immediate foreground around the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground features swirling patterns and clouds around the crystalline tower, missing the original natural elements like snow-draped trees and shrubs immediately adjacent to the church structure in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are snow-covered mountains visible in the background behind the church, with a body of water situated between the church and the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the picturesque backdrop of snow-capped mountains and a body of water placed between the clear foreground and background, akin to the landscape of Image A. Therefore, these natural elements are indeed present visually in Image B.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
