    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the dark wooden beams forming geometric patterns on the facades of the buildings clearly visible and structurally accurate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings are part of a miniature, with visible dark wooden beams creating geometric patterns characteristic of traditional half-timbered architecture, but they do not appear structurally accurate due to the small scale and the artistic representation in the model, deviating from realistic proportions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings feature steeply pitched gabled roofs with dormer windows positioned at regular intervals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are steeply pitched gabled roofs, the presence of dormer windows positioned at regular intervals is not clearly visible. The miniature representation may omit such details to a realistic extent.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a pedestrian bridge spanning the canal in the mid-ground, connecting the two sides of the street?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a miniature representation of a pedestrian bridge in the mid-ground connecting the two sides of the canal. The bridge is visible, supporting the function of connecting both streets.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the canal surface reflect the surrounding buildings and sky with clear, mirror-like fidelity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canal's reflection does not show a mirror-like fidelity due to its representation in a miniature rather than a real water body, making the reflections less likely to be clear and mirror-like.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there flower boxes containing green plants visible along the balcony of the large building on the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings being a part of a miniature diorama do include details like flower boxes with green plants along the balconies, albeit possibly represented in a simplified manner.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are stone bases and metal railings present along the canal edges beneath the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is detail along the canal edges likely resembling stone bases, the inclusion of metal railings is not discernible in this miniature representation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the windows arranged in vertical and horizontal lines on the facades, matching the timber frame divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, since the scene is a scaled-down representation of the original, the windows match the classic half-timbered style but do not perfectly follow the realistic vertical and horizontal alignment, deviating due to the miniature scale.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
