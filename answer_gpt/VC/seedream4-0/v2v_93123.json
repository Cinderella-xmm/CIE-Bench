      "question": "Does the elderly man retain his white hair and mustache?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man still appears with white hair, which is visible on the left side of the image. The hair has a similar texture and volume as seen in such figures, akin to Albert Einstein as the likely identity popularized with a similar facial and hair profile. The blur has strategically concealed the face yet permits glimpses of hair, allowing the observer to confirm the retention of this attribute.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pineapple maintains its defining characteristics with spiky green leaves emerging upward and a textured, golden-brown skin reminiscent of ripe pineapples. These visual clues are staples for recognizably illustrating pineapples, aiding in confirming their retention across both images.",

      "question": "Is the elderly man still gazing contemplatively toward the pineapple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the elderly man remains directed towards the pineapple, suggesting a contemplative gesture or gaze. Despite the blurred facial features, the way his body is angled towards the fruit reflects an attentive, contemplative attitude. This aligns with the common depiction of a thoughtful pose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a warm lighting ambiance, mirroring Image A. The shadows on the pineapple have a soft yet pronounced effect, and the lighting cast upon the elderly man's attire also displays a similar warmthâ€”another sign of consistency in the overall photograph's light setup.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial arrangement between the elderly man and the pineapple is conserved; the pineapple remains positioned on the right side of the frame relative to the man's shoulder position, suggesting that their spatial relationship is indeed maintained, reflecting consistent compositional choices.",
