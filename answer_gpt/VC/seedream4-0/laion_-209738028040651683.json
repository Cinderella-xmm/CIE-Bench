      "question": "Are the almond-shaped eyes with visible dark eyeliner and defined lashes present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a woman in a historical ballroom setting with a period-appropriate dress. While the face is blurred, we can deduce from the context and overall theme that almond-shaped eyes with defined lashes might be expected in such an elaborate setting. However, due to the blurred face, we cannot accurately determine the presence of specific features such as eyeliner, so the answer should be based on visible cues alone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman smiling with visible upper teeth in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the face is blurred so specific details such as a smile or the visibility of teeth cannot be discerned. However, the overall posture and setting suggest elegance and formality, which might align with subtle expressions, but this cannot confirm the specific characteristic of visible upper teeth.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the nose with a straight bridge and rounded tip present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has a blurred face, making it impossible to discern specific facial features such as the nose's shape. Therefore, we cannot confirm the presence of a nose with a straight bridge and rounded tip.",

    {

      "question": "Does the woman have light skin with a warm undertone in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible portions of the skin in the edited image, such as the arms, appear to be light in tone. The setting and lighting also suggest a warm undertone, typical of such formal and lit ballrooms. Therefore, we can reasonably infer that the woman's skin is light with a warm undertone.",

      "question": "Is the woman's body silhouette consistent with the original — upright, slender build, and proportional limbs — in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the woman in a pose typical of a dance or formal gesture, which retains an upright and slender silhouette. While the historical dress is more voluminous, obscuring some body outlines, the build appears consistent with an upright posture and proportional limbs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the woman is depicted in a historical ballroom setting with period attire. She is wearing a beaded necklace that is appropriate for such an ensemble, but there isn't a visible small pendant in the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the woman with a period-appropriate hairstyle that appears to include a wig or powdered hair common in historical settings, not showcasing visible dark brown hair as clearly distinct from the head covering.",
