      "question": "Is the woman’s silver hair clearly visible and styled in a short, neat manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair is represented in a simplified paper cut-out style, which does not capture details such as texture or styling specifics like neatness. Instead, the hair is depicted as an outline consistent with paper art. By contrast, Image A shows clearly visible silver hair styled in a short, neat manner. Therefore, the edited image does not clearly express these details.",

      "question": "Are both hands visibly holding the open book, with fingers wrapped around the edges of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses cut-out paper shapes to represent the woman holding a book. The paper shapes show both hands holding the book, but due to the nature of paper art, there are no visible fingers wrapped around the edges of pages as one would expect in natural imagery. Image A clearly depicts fingers wrapped around the pages of an open book, thus Image B lacks such detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a tabby cat sitting on the red rug in the lower-right corner, facing upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cut-out shape resembling a cat in the lower-right corner, but it is overly simplified and does not showcase distinct features like tabby patterns or directionality of its gaze. In Image A, a tabby cat is visibly sitting on the rug facing upward, depicted with details such as fur patterns and facial direction.",

      "question": "Does the armchair have a high backrest, padded arms, and visible wooden legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the armchair through paper cut-out shapes, showing elements like a high backrest and padded arms within its limitations, but the legs are less detailed and more abstract compared to the more distinct wooden legs visible in Image A. Consequently, the specifics of wooden legs are not discernibly presented in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a stack of five books on the floor to the left of the chair, with a white mug resting on top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a paper stack of books to the left of the chair, and an outline of a mug shape indicating its presence on top of these books, although the color is a standard paper color rather than white. Image A visually confirms five books and a white mug atop the stack, demonstrating the intended positioning in a similar manner.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a white mug on the small wooden side table to the right of the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a paper cut-out shape resembling a mug on what appears to be a side table to the right. The representation lacks detail such as white coloration; it simply corresponds in position and shape. In Image A, a white mug is indeed on the side table to the right. Image B maintains the spatial arrangement but does not define the color details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B creatively uses cut-out paper resembling a patterned blanket over the woman's lap with intricate cut-outs suggesting lace-like designs against a beige background. This parallels the beige knitted blanket with lace-like patterns displayed on the woman's lap in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates the woman in a seated posture, facing forward while attending to a book, consistent with her depiction in Image A. However, due to the nature of paper art, nuances such as a slight forward lean are not clearly identifiable, although the direction and posture do suggest an upright seated position as seen in Image A.",
