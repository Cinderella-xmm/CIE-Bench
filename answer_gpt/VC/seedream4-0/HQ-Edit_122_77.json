      "question": "Are the pink peony flowers with yellow centers still present in the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hair is adorned with a variety of flowers, including pink peony flowers with distinct yellow centers. Common knowledge about peonies tells us that these flowers often feature large, bright petals with central stamens that can be yellow, making them visually identifiable. Hence, based on the visual information alone, we can confirm their presence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dark green high collar still visible on the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the subject is wearing a flowing gown that appears to have more of a draped style and falls off the shoulders, which does not have a high collar like Image A. Therefore, the dark green high collar seen in Image A is not present in Image B.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lighting still soft and even, coming from the front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits natural lighting typical of outdoor settings with ambient light filtering through the trees. This creates a soft and balanced lighting effect. In contrast, Image A has controlled lighting that is softer and more even, typical of studio settings. Thus, Image B still retains a soft lighting but not as uniformly even or frontal due to the outdoor setting.",

      "question": "Are the subject's eyes still dark brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's face is blurred; thus, the eye color cannot be established based on visual cues. Without clear visual confirmation, one cannot determine the eye color as dark brown from Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject's face still centered in the frame with a frontal pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subject in a full-body portrait within a natural setting, focused more on posture, attire, and the environment. The positioning of the head is not distinctly frontal or centered in the frame, as it appears turned slightly to the side. Thus, the frontal pose and centered face in the frame are not maintained as in Image A.",
