    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes positioned symmetrically within the face, with a slight upward slant at the outer edges and gazing directly forward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the editing involves vibrant colors and Van Gogh-inspired swirls in the background, indicating an artistic transformation. However, there are no visible eyes due to the blurred area, so it's impossible to confirm symmetry, slant, or gaze direction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the nose have a straight bridge and a slightly rounded tip, aligned centrally between the eyes?",
    "explanation": "The same reasoning applies here: the central facial features are obscured by blurring in Image B, so it is not possible to determine the characteristics of the nose.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the lips thin, closed, and slightly upturned at the corners, forming a neutral yet thoughtful expression?",
    "explanation": "Like with other facial features, the lips are obscured in Image B, preventing any analysis of their shape or expression.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the face proportionally balanced, with equal spacing between the eyes and symmetrical distribution of facial features?",
    "explanation": "Due to the blurring of the facial area in Image B, it's impossible to evaluate the proportions and symmetry of the facial features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the left ear partially visible, emerging from under the hair near the temple?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, and the hair is styled in an artistic representation. The presence of any ear cannot be discerned through this blurring.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there soft shadows along the right side of the face and under the jawline, created by directional lighting from the left?",
    "explanation": "With the central facial area blurred in Image B, any analysis of lighting and shadow effects on the face is not possible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the head centered above the shoulders, with no unnatural tilt or rotation?",
    "explanation": "Based on the positioning of the shoulders and general outline of the hat in Image B, it appears that the head is centered above the shoulders without any undue tilt or rotation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
