    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bag still rectangular in shape with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag maintains its rectangular shape with rounded corners. The geometric symmetry and proportions observed in the edited design indicate that the fundamental shape of the bag has not been altered. Rounded corners are evident at the bag's edges, suggesting that the basic structure has been preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bag retain a flap-over front section with a horizontal crease?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a flap-over front section, consistent with the original design. The crease is visible as a horizontal separation line where the flap meets the body of the bag. This feature remains unchanged, showing continuity in the design's functional aspects.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a zipper running across the top edge of the bag with a visible gold-tone pull tab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a zipper running across the top edge of the bag, with a gold-tone pull tab clearly visible on the left-hand side. This suggests that the zipper element from Image A was retained in the editing process as a practical closure mechanism.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two vertical stitched panels visible beneath the flap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two vertical elements beneath the flap section. The design change did not remove this structural aspect, indicating it is a continuation from Image A. The stitching lines visible from the edited design maintain the bag's original construction format.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bag have an adjustable shoulder strap with brass-colored buckles on both ends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the adjustable shoulder strap observed in Image A. The strap features brass-colored buckles at both ends, indicating that the strapping mechanism has not changed and remains consistent in its design and functionality.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the bag positioned horizontally and upright in the center of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is visibly positioned horizontally and upright, occupying the central area of the image. This consistent placement from Image A to B allows for a clear and unobstructed view of the bag's new design features, facilitating direct comparison with the original.",
