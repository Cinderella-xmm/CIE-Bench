        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a cartoon depiction of a cat with upright ears. Normally, cats have upright ears, and this cartoonish representation follows the same anatomical expectations, making the ears appear perky and alert. Comparing to Image A, where the real cat also has upright ears, the edited image retains this feature through its design choice.",

      "question": "Are the cat's large expressive eyes preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon cat with exaggeratedly large and expressive eyes, which is typical in 'chibi' or cartoon designs to convey cuteness and innocence. In Image A, the real cat's eyes are proportionate to its head but expressive due to lighting and positioning. The edited, cartoonish version amplifies this feature further.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat's sleek fur texture retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not retain the sleek fur texture seen in Image A. Image B depicts a stylized cartoon, which simplifies the textures into smooth, solid colors typical of cartoon styles. In contrast, the original image, Image A, shows a real cat with visible fur detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon cat is designed with an upward gaze, similar to the real cat in Image A. This posture suggests attentiveness and curiosity. Despite the differences in artistic style, both images convey the same general posture and direction of gaze due to their upward facing head and eyes.",

      "question": "Are the cat's whiskers still visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whiskers are present as simplified lines extending from each side of the cartoon cat's face. This is a common characteristic in cartoon art to suggest a cat's whiskers. Likewise, Image A displays real cat whiskers, further validated by lighting showing them prominently against the background. Both images maintain this feature despite style variations.",
