      "question": "Is the napkin still dark blue?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the napkin retains a dark blue color, similar to what is commonly seen in formal table setups. This assessment is based solely on the visual inspection of Image B in isolation, without referring to other images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the napkin's fabric creases and texture preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the napkin shows visible fabric creases and a texture consistent with woven textiles, suggesting attention to detail in capturing its realistic characteristics. This conclusion is based on recognizing typical napkin textures and folds in such settings.",

      "question": "Does the new spoon occupy the same position on the napkin as the original fork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B alongside Image A, both utensils are centrally placed along the length of the napkin, indicating that the spoon occupies the same relative position as the fork. The analysis involves comparing the centrality and alignment of both items.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the background still a solid dark blue tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows that the background retains a solid dark blue color, which is typical for fabric backgrounds in table settings. This is based solely on the visual cues in Image B without referencing any alterations.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparative analysis between Image A and B reveals consistent lighting and shadowing patterns on the utensils and napkins, suggesting the lighting setup has not changed substantially between the two images. This conclusion draws on observing the direction and softness of shadows.",
