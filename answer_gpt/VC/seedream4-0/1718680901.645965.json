    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the creature’s back or head feature a series of upward-pointing, layered spires that mimic the original building’s roofline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature appears to have a majestic head with some upward elements resembling artistic styling, but these do not strictly mimic the building's roofline, which is characterized by multiple upward-pointing, layered spires. The creature's features do not replicate this architecture in a distinct or obvious manner.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the creature’s body composed of or covered in a golden-hued, metallic material matching the original building’s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is depicted as having a body covered in a golden-hued, metallic material. The original building in Image A features similar golden tones and metallic-like structures, reflecting the theme of opulence and grandeur. Both the creature and the building share this visual aesthetic.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a reflective water surface directly beneath the creature, mirroring its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a reflective water surface is clearly visible beneath the creature, mirroring its form. This reflection creates a symmetrical visual effect, similar to the reflection of the building in Image A.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the creature exhibit a symmetrical, octagonal or radial body structure consistent with the original building’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the creature in Image B is more organically shaped, resembling a magnificent beast rather than an architectural structure. It does not exhibit a symmetrical, octagonal, or radial structure consistent with the building's geometrical layout seen in Image A, which is characterized by such symmetry.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are arched window-like structures or column-like protrusions visible on the creature’s body, echoing the original building’s features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible arched window-like structures or column-like protrusions on the creature's body that directly echo the building's features from Image A. The creature stands on a dome that has architectural elements, but these are not part of the creature's body.",

      "question": "Is the scene illuminated with warm, golden-hour lighting, creating long shadows and a soft glow on the creature and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a warm, golden-hour lighting that casts long shadows and envelops the scene in a soft glow. This lighting is consistent with Image A, where the building is also bathed in similar warm hues, indicating the time of day as sunrise or sunset.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of tall trees that appear to be in an autumnal setting, as indicated by the warm tones and possibly orange or golden hues, suggesting autumn-colored leaves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is there a stone platform beneath the creature with inscribed plinths, similar to those under the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature stands on a platform that appears to be made of stone, but there are no visible inscribed plinths like those under the original building in Image A. The platform is more reflective and does not show the same detailed architectural base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Does the creature feature a triangular, transparent or glass-like panel in its upper section, matching the original building’s design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B does not feature a triangular, transparent, or glass-like panel in its upper section. The original building in Image A does not obviously feature such an element either, as its design involves more traditional architectural forms.",
