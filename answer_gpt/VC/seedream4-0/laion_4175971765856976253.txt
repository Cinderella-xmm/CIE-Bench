    "Question": "Q1: Is the horseshoe-shaped grille with central mesh present on the front of the car and on the robot’s face/torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a prominent horseshoe-shaped grille at the front, which is a characteristic design feature of certain luxury cars like the Bugatti. This same design element is present on the robot’s face/torso, reflecting the transformation concept where car parts are incorporated into the robot's design. This indicates that both the car and the robot share this design element. Understanding such transformation design principles helps in recognizing these features.",
