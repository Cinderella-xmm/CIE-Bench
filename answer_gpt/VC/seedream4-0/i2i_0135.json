        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right is wearing a bright yellow jacket. This conclusion is drawn based on the visible color of the jacket worn by the skier on the right, which is a distinct and vibrant yellow, easily recognizable in the image. Combining this observation with the world knowledge that bright colors like yellow are often used for ski jackets for visibility and style, it confirms the jacket's color.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right is seen with a helmet on their head.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right maintains an active skiing posture. This conclusion comes from visual cues showing the skier's knees are bent, and they are leaning forward, which is a common stance to maintain balance and control while skiing downhill.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the left is still present, wearing a red jacket. The skier's posture and red jacket are visible to the left of the skier in yellow. This aligns with common practices in skiing where multiple skiers can be seen navigating slopes, often wearing bright colors for safety and visibility.",
