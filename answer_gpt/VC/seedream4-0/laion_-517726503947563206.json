      "question": "Is the text \"Aurora\" visible on the side of the ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship displays intricate designs with prism-like structures, but there is no visible text 'Aurora' on the side of the ship. By analyzing the fantasy-like and decorative elements resembling crystals and gemstones covering the entire vessel, it seems deliberately designed to focus on the aesthetics without displaying any clear text compared to visible text areas in standard vessels.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite intricate designs, the registration number 'QV-8880' is not visible on the ship. The decorations mostly consist of crystalline shapes and reflections without any standard numbering or markings that resemble typical ship registrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship's mast is adorned with crystalline structures; however, there is no red flag visible. The mast is mainly decorated with fantasy elements without traditional components like flags compared to Image A, where a red flag is present.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the ship floating on a calm body of water. The water surface appears normal with small ripples, indicating the ship is indeed floating and not immersed or positioned on land forms, consistent with the visual norms of maritime scenes.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is positioned closer to the center of the image. It occupies a central position clearly with the surrounding water, making it the focal point, which aligns with the composition norms for centrally showcasing principle subjects like ships.",
