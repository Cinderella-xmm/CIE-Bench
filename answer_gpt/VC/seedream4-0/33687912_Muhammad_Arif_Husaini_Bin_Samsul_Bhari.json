    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned low on the horizon, centered between the two silhouetted landmasses, and appearing as a bright, circular disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is clearly visible as a bright, circular disc positioned low in the sky. It is centered between two silhouetted landmasses on either side, which frame the sun. This is consistent with typical sunset imagery where the sun is often centered and low on the horizon.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two distinct silhouetted landmasses, one on the left and one on the right, framing the horizon and the sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows two prominent dark shapes, with one on each side of the bright sun on the horizon, suggesting these are silhouetted landmasses that frame the sunset. This framing is commonly used in landscape photography to draw attention to the central subject, which in this case is the sun.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the orange-red gradient of the sky, creating shimmering patterns that mirror the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface is displaying a mix of orange and red colors that are typically reflected from a sunset sky. However, the water also has added elements like glowing neon waves that do not purely mirror the sunset's natural colors. Despite this addition, the underlying reflection retains the orange-red gradient effect typical of a sunset.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky filled with a gradient of warm orange near the horizon transitioning to deeper red and maroon tones higher up?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B features a gradient that starts with a bright, warm orange near the horizon and transitions to deeper red and maroon tones as it moves higher. This color transition is characteristic of a vivid sunset.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear, straight horizon line dividing the sky and water, with the sun resting directly on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear, straight line demarcates the division between the sky and water, typifying the horizon. The sun is positioned right on this line, which is a common phenomenon during sunset when the sun appears to be sitting directly on the horizon.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there faint, thin clouds visible in the upper portion of the sky, partially illuminated by the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows faint, thin clouds in the skyâ€™s higher regions. These clouds are softly illuminated by the sunset's glow, enhancing the atmospheric conditions typical in sunset imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the water surface show gentle ripples and small waves, indicating calm movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface exhibits waves lit with an artificially enhanced glow, breaking the illusion of gentle, calm movement conveyed by natural ripples or small waves. Therefore, the added elements make the water appear more dynamic than calm.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
