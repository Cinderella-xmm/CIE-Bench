      "question": "Is the pile of diced vegetables on the left side of the image orange in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pile of diced vegetables on the left side is clearly orange in color. The shape and arrangement of the pieces suggest that they are diced carrots, as carrots are commonly diced into small cubes and are orange. This is consistent with world knowledge of how carrots look when diced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the green vegetable pieces in the center of the image have a curved, C-shaped form with a visible hollow center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green vegetable pieces in the center appear to have a curved, C-shaped form with visible hollow centers. This shape and structure are characteristic of celery slices, which are typically cut in such a manner. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude based on visual evidence and common knowledge about vegetable shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the diced vegetables on the right side of the image pale white or translucent in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diced vegetables on the right side appear pale white. The pieces resemble onions, which are often pale white or translucent when diced. This assessment is based on the color and texture typical of chopped white onions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a knife with a metallic blade and black handle located in the upper right portion of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a knife located in the upper right portion. The blade of the knife appears metallic due to its reflective surface, and the handle looks black, likely indicating a typical kitchen knife design with a metallic blade and a black handle.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the vegetables and knife a wooden cutting board with visible horizontal grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the vegetables and knife has a wooden texture with colored triangular sections rather than a traditional uniform grain. This differs from a typical cutting board, which is uniformly wooden with visible grain patterns running across the board. Thus, while there are wooden elements, the patterning is artistic rather than strictly functional.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the three piles of vegetables arranged in a triangular pattern with carrots on the left, celery in the middle, and onions on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables are arranged in a linear rather than a triangular pattern. Carrots are on the left, celery is in the middle, and onions are on the right, following a straightforward left-to-right alignment rather than forming a triangle.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the knife placed diagonally across the upper right area of the image, adjacent to the pile of onions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is indeed placed diagonally in the upper right area of the image and adjacent to the pile of onions, as observed by the proximity of the knife's blade to the rightmost portion of the vegetable arrangement.",
