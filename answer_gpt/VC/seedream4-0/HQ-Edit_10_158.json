      "question": "Does the boot retain the same shape and arrangement of the elongated oval cutouts on the side panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot is crafted to resemble a wooden structure, yet it still features the elongated oval cutouts on the side panels. Analyzing Image A, the same elongated oval cutouts are present. By visual comparison, both images show cutouts arranged in a similar pattern along the side panels. Despite the different materials and textures, the shape and arrangement remain consistent.",

      "question": "Are the eyelets positioned in the same vertical alignment and spacing as in the original boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the eyelets of the boot in a consistent vertical alignment and spacing. In Image A, the eyelets are also arranged vertically with a uniform spacing. Upon examining both images, it can be concluded that the positioning and alignment of the eyelets appear identical between the two.",

      "question": "Does the outsole retain the exact tread pattern and groove depth as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a boot with a uniformly patterned outsole typical of carved wood, but lacking the detailed tread pattern and groove depth that would be functional in a real boot. In Image A, the outsole has a complex tread pattern with clear groove depths designed for traction. Comparing the two, Image B simplifies the pattern, making it less detailed, thus not retaining the exact tread pattern and groove depth.",

      "question": "Is the toe cap present and shaped identically to the original, including its rounded front and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toe cap is present and maintains the rounded shape typical of many boots. Image A also features a rounded toe cap that is positioned at the front of the boot. A detailed comparison shows that while the toe cap is present in both images, the carved nature in Image B slightly alters the visual perception, but generally, the shape and position remain aligned.",

      "question": "Is the padded collar at the top of the boot preserved in shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B displays a collar at the top which mimics the appearance of padding in carved wood. Image A's boot includes a padded collar designed for comfort. Despite the material transformation in Image B, the shape and relative position of the collar to the boot remain consistent.",

      "question": "Is the boot positioned in the same side profile with the same forward tilt as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images depict the boot in a side profile. In Image B, the boot is carved with a forward tilt that matches the stance of the boot in Image A. Analyzing their positioning, the boots share a similar alignment and angle from a side view, suggesting consistent positioning.",
      "weight": 2,

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the tongue of the boot visible and shaped similarly to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible tongue in Image B maintains a similar shape, rising from the midsection of the boot and fits within traditional boot structure, consistent with its depiction in Image A. Analysis shows that although crafted from wood, the tongue's shape and positioning are preserved from the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a heel counter at the back of the boot integrated into the wood carving. The heel counter in Image A is a distinct part of the boot providing structure and support. A comparison reveals that while the heel counter exists in both, the transition from fabric to wood might slightly affect its shape, although it maintains a generally similar form.",
