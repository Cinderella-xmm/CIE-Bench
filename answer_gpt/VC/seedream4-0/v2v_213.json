      "question": "Does the edited image retain the specific black spots and white markings on the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is designed in a pixelated, blocky style reminiscent of pixel art or digital graphics. While the butterfly does have black spots and white markings on its wings, these are interpreted in a simplified pixelated form rather than detailed patterns. Meanwhile, in Image A, these markings are clearly shown with intricate details characteristic of a natural butterfly wing pattern. Thus, while Image B retains the spots and markings, it does so in a stylized and less detailed manner.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the butterfly in a pixelated form, giving it a block-like appearance with clean edges and surfaces. This style contrasts with a realistic depiction seen in Image A, where the fuzzy texture of the butterfly's body is observable. The edited style does not capture the fuzzy, textured appearance because it focuses on a simplified and angular representation.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly still positioned on the wooden surface in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image B and Image A show the butterfly positioned on a wooden surface, maintaining the same location. This aspect of the scene remains consistent across both images, indicating that the butterfly's position relative to the wooden table is unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings are created using a pixelated style, resulting in a loss of detailed texture that is evident in the realistic portrayal of Image A. The natural texture and wing veining apparent in Image A are not present in Image B because the wings are stylized into geometric shapes and solid blocks.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the specific arrangement of spots on the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly with black and white markings arranged similarly to those in Image A, albeit interpreted in a pixelated, simplified manner. Despite the pixelation, the overall arrangement of spots relative to each other and the wing shape is maintained, albeit simplified. Thus, while the texture is simplified, the arrangement of spots is consistently represented.",
