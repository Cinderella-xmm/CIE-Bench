      "question": "Are the child’s eyes almond-shaped with dark brown irises and a visible light reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features appear stylized as part of a chibi design, typical of large-headed figures with exaggerated features and small body proportions. This stylization often simplifies or omits realistic details such as eye shapes, irises, or reflections. Therefore, we don't observe almond-shaped eyes with dark brown irises or visible reflections.",

      "question": "Is the child’s hair light brown and styled in a low ponytail with loose strands around the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the child with a chibi figure's hair that appears to be a solid shape without individual strands. The hair is depicted as light brown and pulled back in a low ponytail. However, the caricatured style does not show loose strands around the face, which is typical of more detailed, realistic representations.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the child wear a short-sleeved, rust-colored t-shirt with a round neckline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is depicted wearing a t-shirt as part of the chibi likeness. The color matches rust and the shirt has short sleeves with a round neckline, commonly seen in such simplified designs. These characteristics align with the description.",

      "question": "Are the child’s pants blue denim jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the child in pants that appear to be blue, which are simplified and stylized. In chibi designs, clothing textures such as denim might not be evident due to the simplistic representation. However, the overall visual suggests blue pants which align with denim jeans.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is seated in a cross-legged position, typical of a relaxed or attentive posture while focusing on something. Her hands are placed in front, suggesting the possibility of holding or supporting the tablet, rather than clasped between the knees.",
      "weight": 2,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is depicted as oriented towards a tablet. While facial features are stylized, the positioning and posture suggest an interaction or focus on the device, matching the inference of a directed gaze.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tablet held by the child, rather than placed on the table, reflecting the chibi design focus on the character interaction with objects directly rather than their placement nearby. Therefore, the depiction does not include a tablet placed on the table.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has feet that are simplified and stylized as part of the chibi design. The depiction does not include clear footwear, which suggests that the child is barefoot.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the floor and table crafted from materials that represent wood, consistent with light coloring and an implied grain pattern typical of natural wooden surfaces, matching the description.",
