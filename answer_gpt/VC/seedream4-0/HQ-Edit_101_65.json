    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the subject's facial expression, including a wide smile showing teeth and eyes looking upward to the left, preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we cannot evaluate facial expressions as the face is obscured, preventing analysis of the smile or direction of the eyes. Without these visual cues, determining expression details is impossible.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the subject's head turned slightly to the left, maintaining the original angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can only assess the angle of the head based on the neck and shoulder orientation. The head appears to be aligned with the torso, making it difficult to assess any leftward turn without facial cues.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's hands are positioned in front of the torso, similar to Image A. However, the fingers are not interlaced, but rather placed over each other.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
