      "question": "Does the locomotive retain its green color and the \"ROVES 1621\" label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the locomotive with a green exterior and the visible label \"ROVES 1621\". The presence of smoke and the clear details of the locomotive color are consistent with a train actively running. Thus, both the green color and the label are retained in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the train still positioned on the tracks and heading towards the observer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is clearly situated on the tracks, moving in the direction of the observer based on the angle and position of the train relative to the railway lines. This orientation indicates that no changes were made regarding its movement or position.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the reddish-brown vintage-style passenger cars still attached to the locomotive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still shows the reddish-brown passenger cars attached to the locomotive. The continuity in their style and the uninterrupted sequence suggest that they remain as part of the train, consistent with vintage rail designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there still a group of people standing on the platform near the train?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a group of people is visible on the platform near the train, observing it as it moves. This indicates a likely interest in the train, typical during events or regular station boarding scenarios, and shows their unchanged presence.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting conditions and shadows still indicate late afternoon or early evening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents warm lighting and elongated shadows, typical of late afternoon or early evening settings. The lighting and shadow direction contribute to this time-of-day inference, consistent with similar conditions in Image A.",
