      "question": "Does the edited image retain the representation of a navigational tool (map)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface appearance mimics the structure and complex patterns typical of a tiled artwork or mosaic. These patterns do not resemble the standard map features like geographical markers, roads, or names found in Image A. Rather, Image B serves purely as an artistic representation lacking identifiable map elements used for navigation. Therefore, Image B does not retain the functional attributes of a navigational tool.",

      "question": "Are there identifiable markers (pins) indicating specific locations/routes on the map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays colored pins placed on a tile-like mosaic surface with routes, suggesting a conceptual representation. Despite the pins being present, without recognizable map features to denote specific map locations like city names or borders, these pins on their own lack clear mapping context. In essence, while pins are visible, their lack of contextual identifiers on a map excludes them from indicating specific locations in a conventional manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible hand interacting with the map, specifically placing a marker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Unlike Image A, which shows a hand placing a red pin on a traditional map, Image B does not include any human interaction or presence like a hand, specifically placing a marker. The focus is solely on the mosaic and arranged pins. Human interaction is notably absent in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the markers (pins) visibly connected, suggesting a planned route?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there is a visible connection between the pins facilitated by a green line, akin to a depiction of routes on maps. Such connections often depict a planned route or sequence, independent of conventional map elements. Thus, the presence of visibly connected pins in Image B suggests a concept of route planning, although not within a navigational context like Image A.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the wooden surface and the beige sweater sleeve as part of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a composition solely of a mosaic-like surface without any items or human elements depicted in Image A, like the wooden surface or the beige sweater sleeve. This artistic or mosaic representation deliberately removes these real-world elements or backgrounds, focusing entirely on the artwork's nature and design.",
