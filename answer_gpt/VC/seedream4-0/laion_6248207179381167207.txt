    "explanation": "Image B depicts a zipper running across the top edge of the bag, with a gold-tone pull tab clearly visible on the left-hand side. This suggests that the zipper element from Image A was retained in the editing process as a practical closure mechanism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there two vertical stitched panels visible beneath the flap?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two vertical elements beneath the flap section. The design change did not remove this structural aspect, indicating it is a continuation from Image A.
