      "question": "Is the cat depicted in a curled-up position with one paw visibly stretched out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is drawn in a cartoonish style with an exaggerated curled position, which is common for a sticker design. The cat's paws are tucked under its body, and none are stretched out. The cartoon simplification of designs does not focus on intricate details such as one paw being visibly stretched; instead, it emphasizes the overall familiar curled-up shape.",

      "question": "Is the cat shown lying on a curved surface representing the car's hood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized, cartoon depiction where the cat is positioned on what indicates as a car hood. The surface is drawn with lines that suggest a gentle curve, representing the car hood's typical shape in a simplified form. This is consistent with representations of cars in stickers, where details are minimized but generalized shapes are maintained.",

      "question": "Are there reflection lines present on the curved surface under the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are stylized lines on the car hood that imply reflections or highlights typical of a glossy or metal surface. These lines are common in illustrations to suggest a shiny surface, even though they aren't literal reflections as seen in photographs.",

      "question": "Is the entire sticker image surrounded by a thick white outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the entire sticker image of the cat on the car hood is indeed surrounded by a thick white outline. This is a common design feature in stickers to make the main design stand out and to create a uniform edge around the design.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sticker have a transparent background behind the outlined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car and cat illustration with a white outline, and the area outside the outline appears to be transparent, allowing the background (in this display, a checkered pattern typically used to represent transparency in digital images) to show through. This indicates that the image is designed to be a sticker with a transparent background.",
