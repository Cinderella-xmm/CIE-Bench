      "question": "Does the image retain the Mercedes-Benz grille and logo on the front of the van?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct Mercedes-Benz grille along with the recognizable star logo prominently displayed in the front center. This is a common trait across Mercedes-Benz vehicles, likely retained to emphasize brand identity. Comparing with Image A, which also features the Mercedes-Benz logo on its grille, both images maintain this key branding feature, thus confirming its presence in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the overall shape and structure of the van consistent with the original Mercedes-Benz Sprinter design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a van with a different design compared to a typical Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. The overall structure is reminiscent of older van styles with a more classic and boxy design, which is not characteristic of the contemporary Sprinterâ€™s aerodynamic and modern shape seen in Image A. Therefore, the design in Image B is not consistent with the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter's structural design.",

      "question": "Are the wheels placed in the same positions and maintain similar sizes as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the wheels relative to the body of the vehicle aligns with typical vehicle design, with wheels placed at the corners. However, the wheel size and style differ from those seen in Image A. In Image A, the wheels are more utility-oriented with a simpler design, while in Image B, the wheels have a more classic style with chrome details. This stylistic difference signifies that even if the placements might be similar, the sizes and styles are not.",

      "question": "Does the van still have clean lines and no visible side windows on the cargo area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a van with visible side windows, as opposed to the original styling in Image A where the cargo area of the van lacks side windows. The presence of side windows in Image B deviates from the clean, uninterrupted panel style typically associated with cargo-oriented vans like the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.",

      "question": "Does the van retain the large windshield with the same dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windshield appears proportionally smaller relative to the overall vehicle size compared to Image A. It also has a more old-fashioned shape, consistent with the vintage style of the van in Image B. In contrast, the windshield in Image A is large and designed for maximum visibility and safety, as expected in modern vehicle design such as the Sprinter. Thus, Image B does not retain the same windshield design and dimensions.",
