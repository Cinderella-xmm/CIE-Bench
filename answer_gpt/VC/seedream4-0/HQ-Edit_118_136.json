      "question": "Is the skater depicted in a mid-air crouched posture with both arms extended outward for balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is depicted in a crouched position above the skate ramp with his limbs forming a dynamic pose. The skater’s arms are noticeably extended outward which is a typical posture skaters adopt when balancing in mid-air. This visual cue, combined with the knowledge that such a posture helps in maintaining equilibrium during aerial maneuvers, supports the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the skater’s left foot placed firmly on the skateboard while the right foot is slightly raised off the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater’s left foot appears planted firmly on the skateboard, giving an impression of control over the board. The right foot, on the other hand, is positioned towards the rear of the board and seems slightly elevated, suggesting a maneuver often executed in skateboarding tricks. This combination of visual evidence and knowledge about skateboarding stances leads to a logical conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the skater’s head and eyes look toward the right side of the frame, indicating forward momentum?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater’s head orientation suggests that he is looking in the direction towards the right side of the frame. This directional focus with the head is interpreted as an indication of the skater aligning his sight towards where he is heading, thus suggesting forward momentum. This analysis stems from visual observation combined with understanding skater movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skater positioned above the surface of the ramp, indicating he is airborne?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skater in Image B is shown clearly elevated above the ramp surface. The visual impression given by the height of the skater and the skateboard above the ramp provides clear evidence that the skater is not in contact with the surface, suggesting an airborne state. This observation is corroborated by understanding of typical skateboarding tricks and maneuvers.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a second person, an older man in a dark jacket, visible in the background running across the ramp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, there is indeed a figure who appears to be an older man, visible in a posture similar to running or moving across the ramp, dressed in a dark jacket. The identification of this figure involves visual interpretation of the person's stance and attire, leading to the conclusion that such a presence is depicted.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a curved ramp structure forming a bowl-like shape in the foreground, beneath the skater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground features a ramp structure that has a characteristic curve forming a sort of bowl-like dip or basin, common in skate parks to allow for tricks and airborne stunts. This perceived bowl shape beneath the skater is visible through visual analysis of the ramp’s form and is a standard feature of skateboarding environments.",
