      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of the bed as the central object?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed is prominently featured in the center of the image, similar to Image A. The bed is visually central and occupies a significant portion of the space, indicating its importance as the main object in both images. This prominent placement suggests that the edit retained the bed as the central focal point.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the warm glow from the lamp and candles?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lamp on a bedside table and a couple of candles, both emitting light. The edited image uses bright colors to convey warmth, similar to the warm glow in Image A generated by the lamp and candles. The illustration style might simplify the lighting, but the visual representation suggests a warm atmosphere, indicating that this characteristic was retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the soft texture representation of the bedding?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding is depicted in an illustrated, exaggerated style with smooth curves and highlighted areas, suggesting softness. Image A presents a visibly textured and plush bedding. Despite the stylistic differences, the impression of softness is conveyed in both images, as the edit appears to emphasize this through its visual style.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a single pillow with a face, created in a simplified and stylized form. In contrast, Image A features multiple pillows. The edited image simplifies the design, resulting in a stylized singular pillow, which differs from the original arrangement in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image B and Image A, the bedside table is positioned to the left of the bed. The consistent placement in both images confirms that the relative position of the bedside table to the bed is retained in the edited version.",
