      "question": "Does the dog retain its white fur color and sharp, upright ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, based on visual cues, the dog has a consistent fur color pattern that can be identified as white. The ears are visibly pointed upwards and appear sharp, maintaining an upright position. This observation is consistent with a typical characteristic of certain dog breeds known for such erect ears.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog's mouth open, showing its teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the blurred face, it is not possible to directly observe if the dog's mouth is open, showing its teeth and tongue.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dog wear a red collar around its neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B shows that the dog wears a prominent blue bowtie instead of a red collar. This indicates a change in accessory color and style, noting that a red collar is absent.",

      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's body position and orientation in Image B give the visual impression that it is moving toward the camera. The dynamic posture, with paws elevated as if in motion, suggests forward movement.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background setting shows a grassy area with out-of-focus elements that can be interpreted as trees. The blurred background is typical of an outdoor park setting, featuring grass and distant trees, commonly seen in such scenes.",
