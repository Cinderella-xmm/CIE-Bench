    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes blue and positioned symmetrically in the face, looking directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the face area blurred, so it's impossible to assess eye color, position, or direction. Normally, one would look for the eye's color and symmetry to determine this, but the blur prevents such analysis.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nose small, rounded, and centrally located on the face, aligned with the eyes and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred face in Image B prevents examination of the nose's size, shape, and alignment. Typically, one would evaluate the nose's position relative to other facial features, but the blur obscures these details.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mouth closed, with natural lips forming a gentle, neutral line centered beneath the nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face is blurred in Image B, making it impossible to assess the state or position of the mouth. Usually, mouth shape and position would be clear, but not in this case due to the blur.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the shirt white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is wearing a white shirt. This is confirmed by the visible area that shows a consistent white color, with texture suggesting a soft fabric.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the subject standing upright with arms relaxed at her sides and facing directly forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is shown standing upright, with no visible tension in her posture. The alignment suggests she's facing forward with arms at her sides, supported by the symmetrical presentation of the wings.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the skin tone consistently fair and unblemished across the face and neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face in Image B, assessment of skin tone on the face isn't feasible. The neck area does appear fair and unblemished, but since the face cannot be evaluated, a definitive answer is not possible.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the facial features symmetrically aligned along the vertical midline of the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blur on the face in Image B renders it impossible to judge the symmetry of facial features. Symmetry is typically observed in the alignment of eyes, nose, and mouth, but this is not visible here.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
