    "Question": "Q1: Is the clock face still white after the edit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face appears to be white. This is determined by observing the flat, light color of the clock face, which is consistent with a white color in visual representation. There are no indications of other colors or patterns that would suggest a change from white. The visual cue of a clean, monochrome face allows us to conclude the clock face remains white.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are both the hour and minute hands still black after the edit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hour and minute hands are observed to be in black color. This can be determined by their dark appearance in contrast to the white face of the clock, a common choice for readability and aesthetic consistency in minimalistic clock designs. The unaltered appearance of the hands suggests they remain unchanged in color.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there still a red second hand on the clock after the edit?",
    "explanation": "The second hand in Image B appears to be red, which is typical for second hands designed to stand out from the hour and minute hands in many clock designs. This is reinforced by the visual distinction of a thin, elongated feature in red diverging from the central pivot point. The distinct visual cue supports that the red second hand remains.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the orange pivot point still present after the edit?",

The unchanged appearance indicates the orange pivot point remains.",
