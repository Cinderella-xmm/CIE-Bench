        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the smartphone continues to have a silver-colored body, visible circular home button, and rounded corners. Despite the futuristic and high-tech elements like blue holographic interfaces, these basic design aspects remain unchanged.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laptop still appears to have a silver chassis, a black keyboard, and a visible trackpad located below the keyboard. The image's focus on adding futuristic elements does not alter these basic features. This retains consistency with Image A, which also shows a laptop with a silver body, black keys, and a trackpad positioned below the keyboard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is displayed with five fingers wrapped naturally around the phone. The presence of fingernails is still visible, indicating an anatomically correct hand. The added digital/holographic elements don't interfere with the anatomical accuracy. Image A also shows a hand with these features, supporting the similarity between the two.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the smartphone held directly above the laptop's keyboard, with the hand positioned over the trackpad area. This positioning is identical to that in Image A, where the hand is similarly placed.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, horizontal window blinds serve as the background, positioned behind the laptop. These blinds are apparent despite the futuristic augmentation in the image, echoing the background elements from Image A, which also features window blinds. This similarity is maintained even with additional digital effects.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features blue as a dominant color across both the smartphone and laptop screens. The augmented effects add futuristic blue hues, strengthening the color’s prominence in the image. Image A, though having a different color scheme primarily in monochrome, does not feature this same dominance of blue.",
