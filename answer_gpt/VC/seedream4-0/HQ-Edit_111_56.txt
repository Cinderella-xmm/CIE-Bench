    "Question": "Q1: Are both feet positioned en pointe, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a statue with its left leg slightly bent, as if stepping forward, while the foot is flat, which is different from an en pointe position in ballet, where the toes are pointed downward and the heel is high off the ground. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the statue doesnâ€™t have both feet positioned en pointe.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are both arms extended laterally from the body, with palms facing inward and fingers gently curved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue has its left arm extending backward rather than laterally, with a relaxed posture. The right arm is slightly raised, but not in a lateral extension as described. Both hands are not clearly visible for palm orientation or finger curvature due to the angle.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the head turned to the left, with the chin slightly raised?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the statue's head turned slightly to the right, away from the viewer's perspective without a noticeably raised chin. The head positioning suggests a gentle directional turn instead.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the legs fully extended and aligned vertically, with the spine slightly arched backward?",
    "explanation": "The statue's positioning shows the left leg bent as if in mid-step, whereas the right leg appears more static. The vertical alignment described does not match the gentle step posture seen, disregarding a backward arch in the spine.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the arms positioned at approximately hip level, extending outward from the sides of the torso?",
    "explanation": "The left arm of the statue extends behind the torso, while the right arm is slightly lifted, neither at hip level nor outward, indicating no direct lateral extension from the torso as described.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the upper body slightly tilted forward while maintaining vertical alignment through the spine?",
    "explanation": "The statue's overall posture reflects an upright position, with the upper body maintaining traditional vertical alignment of classical statues, showing no evidence of a forward tilt.",
    "answer": "No"
