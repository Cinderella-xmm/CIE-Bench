      "question": "Does the stylized illustration retain the scalloped pattern on the wings and back, with alternating dark and light feather edges forming a scale-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration on the product packaging features the bird with a detailed pattern on its wings and back. This pattern includes alternating dark and light feather edges, creating a texture similar to scales. The precision of this detail indicates that the design element has been retained in the stylized version. This conclusion is drawn from the visible design of the feathers, which is consistent with the description of the scalloped pattern.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's breast and throat area is depicted with a peach-orange hue that clearly contrasts with the darker coloration of the upper body. This distinction in color is evident and consistent, serving to highlight the different parts of the bird's body. This observation is based on the color contrast visible between the underparts and the upper body in the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bird's beak as long and straight. It appears uniformly black and extends from the face without any noticeable curvature. This description is inferred from the visual appearance of the beak in the illustration, conforming to the specified features.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eye is clearly defined and dark, positioned near the center of its head. It appears surrounded by lighter skin, giving it prominence on the face. This is evident from the contrast between the eye and the surrounding skin area, making the eye appear distinct.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the bird are depicted as dark gray-black. They end in three distinct forward-facing toes with visible claws, which are common characteristics of the bird's feet. This conclusion is drawn from the visible depiction of the legs and feet in the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is standing with its legs fully extended and the body upright. This posture simulates a natural stance that a bird might take on a shoreline, which is complemented by the background scenery on the packaging. This understanding is based on the posture visible in the illustration and the accompanying foreground elements that suggest a shoreline habitat.",
