      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the lower facial region where a beard is typically discernible. The presence of white hair below the mouth and around the chin area suggests a beard and mustache. Given that the hair is depicted as white with no indications of brown or black, it aligns with the characteristic of a subject having a white beard and mustache.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the head is depicted with short hair, primarily white in color. The pattern of the hair reveals signs of thinning commonly associated with aging, hinting at a receding hairline, which fits the description of short, graying white hair.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the section of the mouth appears to be closed, as there is no gap or depiction suggesting its openness. The absence of a visible opening or any indications of movement in that region suggests that the subject's mouth does not appear slightly open.",
