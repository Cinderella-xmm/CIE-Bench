    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image retain the hippo's large size and wrinkled skin texture?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the hippo is depicted in a cartoonish style as part of a toy or game aesthetic, which lacks the detailed wrinkled skin texture seen in the natural, realistic depiction of Image A. The hippo's size relative to the rabbit in Image B does not reflect its natural large size, as they are styled similarly in proportion. Hence, the size and texture are not retained in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
