      "question": "Is the subject’s hair light blonde in color and visibly full and styled upward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues show the subject with hair that is a uniform light color, positioned in a styled, voluminous manner that appears to be upward. This aligns with common representations of light-blonde hair styled for prominence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the subject have a prominent forehead and wide jawline that define the facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the cartoonish representation, the facial structure exaggerates features, suggesting a likeness to a wide jawline and prominent forehead. Though abstract, these elements are indicative of a defined facial structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject's right hand is clearly depicted as raised with fingers spread apart, mimicking the common gesture of waving. The palm's outward orientation reinforces this conclusion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted in a brightly colored suit, not a dark formal one. Despite the lack of conventional color, the illustration maintains the structure of a suit jacket over a shirt.",

    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred face in the image, we cannot assess definitively the direction of the subject's eyes. However, typical forward-facing and slightly off-center alignment is often used in similar portrayals.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is centrally positioned in front of what seems to be an audience, with the body angled frontward. This suggests a forward-facing orientation typical in such scenarios.",
