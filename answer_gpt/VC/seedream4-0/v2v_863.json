        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted as a chibi or cartoonish character. Despite the stylistic change, the elephant still has prominent, large ears, tusks, and a trunk which are characteristic features of an elephant, although they are simplified to suit the cartoon style. The analysis concludes that these elements are preserved in the editing.",

      "question": "** Does the edited image show the elephant in a posture that suggests it is carrying something heavy?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is a stylized, cartoonish character positioned next to a cereal box. It stands upright without any indication of physical strain or posture that would suggest it is carrying something heavy, unlike Image A where the elephant is supporting a globe. This comparison shows the edited image lacks representations of weight-bearing posture.",

      "question": "** Does the edited image retain earthy tones and a textured appearance for the elephant's skin?\n**",
      "choices": [
        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish elephant has smooth skin with a simplistic color scheme, lacking the realistic texture and earthy tones seen in Image A. This indicates the image does not retain these particular realistic features, as they are absent in the more simplistic cartoon style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a light-hearted, cheerful atmosphere with the depiction of the elephant amid a market setting with plants and bright colors, contributing to a serene and harmonious visual environment. This conclusion is drawn from the overall playful and peaceful ambiance created by the cartoon style and setting.",

        "** Yes",
        "No\n**"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "** Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box in Image B prominently displays visual elements such as whole grains, nuts, and tropical fruits like pineapples and citrus, conceptually representing the ingredients. The clear visibility and detailed depiction of these elements ensure that they effectively convey the design's intention.",
