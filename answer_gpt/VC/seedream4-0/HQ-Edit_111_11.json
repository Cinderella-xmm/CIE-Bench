    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the elderly man’s deeply wrinkled facial features, including the pronounced vertical lines on the forehead and crow’s feet around the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, any detailed facial features such as wrinkles or lines cannot be assessed due to the face being blurred. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether the elderly man's deeply wrinkled facial features are retained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the saxophone still present and held in the same manner, with the player’s left hand on the keys and the mouthpiece touching the lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the saxophone is present, but it is being handled differently. The musician is holding the saxophone with the left hand on the keys, but the scene's ambiance implies a change in context and presentation. However, without direct observation of the mouthpiece touching the lips due to the blur, we conclude the holding is somewhat similar but more stylized.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the two glasses and the brown bottle still placed on the table in front of the musician, with one glass partially full and the other empty?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are two glasses and a brown bottle on the table, similar to the original setup. The observation that one glass is partially full and the other may appear differently is consistent with the context, but the setup mostly remains the same.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dark wooden tabletop still visible with subtle reflections of the glasses and bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dark wooden tabletop is visible, and subtle reflections from the glasses and bottle can be observed. The presence of reflections is consistent with the surface material and light interaction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, lighting appears above and behind the subject, casting shadows consistent with such a light source. Although facial shadows are not visible due to blurring, the lighting setup suggests a similar position for light sources.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the musician’s hands positioned correctly on the saxophone, with the left hand supporting the lower section and the right hand pressing the keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the musician's hands are seen interacting with the instrument, with the left hand on the keys. Although the detail of hand positions on specific saxophone sections is obscured by context styling, the general handling reflects knowledge of saxophone playing.",
