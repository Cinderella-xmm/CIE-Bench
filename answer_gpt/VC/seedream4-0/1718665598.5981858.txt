    "Question": "Q1: Is there a long, continuous road-like structure extending into the distance, serving as the central axis of the composition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent pathway that resembles a road, illustrated using geometric shapes and colors that create the perspective effect of a long, continuous path extending into the distance. This road-like design serves as the central axis of the composition, guiding the eye from the foreground to the background, which is a common method in artwork to suggest depth and direction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible diagonal streaks or patterns indicating falling rain across the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible diagonal streaks or patterns that suggest the presence of rain. The design elements are composed of geometric shapes and colors with no indication of movement or patterns typically associated with falling rain.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there tall vertical structures with horizontal crossbars positioned along the right side of the road?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are vertical structures depicted along the right side of the road, which resemble utility poles, a common feature in landscapes. These poles have horizontal crossbars, similar to utility or telephone poles, and contribute to the scene's composition by adding vertical elements that contrast with the road's horizontal flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there tree-like forms present on both sides of the road, aligned with the guardrails?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict explicit tree-like forms. The design consists of abstract geometric shapes and colors without specific depiction of trees or natural elements. The composition focuses more on the structural and geometric abstraction rather than replicating the natural forms found in the original image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a visible division in the sky between dark clouds and a brighter, illuminated area near the horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is represented through abstract geometric shapes without a clear depiction of clouds or a division between dark and illuminated areas as in Image A. The design does not aim to replicate the natural sky effect found in the original image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there barrier-like structures running along both edges of the road?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design features elements that resemble guardrails or barriers along the edges of the road. These are part of the geometric abstraction representing structural elements typically found along a roadway, maintaining the thematic elements of a road environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a continuous yellow line running down the center of the road?",
    "explanation": "Image B does depict a central yellow line—a typical feature of roadways—by using a long, narrow geometric shape in a yellow hue down the center of the road-like structure, which emulates road markings seen in a real environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
