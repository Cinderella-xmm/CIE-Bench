      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's jersey displays the name 'RONALDO' along with the number '7'. There is no indication of 'RONALOO' on the jersey, which suggests that the correct spelling, as commonly associated with this player, 'RONALDO', is correctly depicted here.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player is shown in a dynamic pose, with one leg raised back as if in the act of kicking a soccer ball. The body posture, with the leg extended and the heel inclined, indicates an action directed towards kicking the ball situated near the goalpost. Body movement knowledge and visual cues help deduce the kicking act.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stadium setting with rows of spectators visible in the background and bright, artificial stadium lights illuminating the venue.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The goalkeeper in Image B is distinctly dressed in green attire and positioned in proximity to the goalpost. The color green, often used for goalkeeper jerseys to differentiate from players, is evident, and the player's stance suggests preparedness to respond to a goal attempt. This aligns with typical soccer settings and positions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a soccer ball positioned close to the goalpost, suggesting an action of moving towards it. The direction and position relative to the playerâ€™s kicking motion indicate that the ball is in the process of entering the goal area, demonstrating motion towards scoring. This assessment relies on understanding ball trajectory and game dynamics.",
