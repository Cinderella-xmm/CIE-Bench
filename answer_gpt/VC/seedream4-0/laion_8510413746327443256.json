    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the display of the device rectangular with rounded corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display of the device has a clear rectangular shape and the corners of this rectangle appear rounded rather than sharp, which is a typical design for modern smartwatches to provide a softer aesthetic and a more comfortable user experience.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the digital crown positioned on the right side of the watch case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a digital crown is visible and it is located on the right side of the watch case. The crown is a circular button, which typically is used for menu navigation and other functionalities on many smartwatch designs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small button located below the digital crown on the right side of the case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no small button visible directly below the digital crown on the right side. The focus of the design is more on the ornamental aspects with a dragon motif rather than practical typical smartwatch features.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ends of the band attached to the left and right sides of the watch case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the band is designed as a dragon that seems to be integrated into and wrapped around the watch case, rather than being simply attached at the sides in the traditional sense. Therefore, it doesn't conform to the usual smartwatch design where bands are clearly attached at the left and right ends of the case.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the screen facing directly forward, perpendicular to the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the screen is designed to face forward, in a position perpendicular to where a wrist would typically be if the device is worn, similar to standard watch ergonomics. This is done so the user can easily look at the screen.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the watch case have a slim, compact profile with minimal depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch case appears to have a more elaborate design with a metallic dragon motif, indicating a bulkier profile compared to a slim, compact case. This suggests that the case does not have a minimal depth due to the additional ornamental features added.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there multiple adjustment holes along the length of the band?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the band is styled as a smooth, continuous dragon scale design without visible adjustment holes. Typically, adjustment holes are seen in more conventional watch bands for size customization, but in this design, the aesthetic replaces functional adjustability.",
