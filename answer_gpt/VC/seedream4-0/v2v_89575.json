      "question": "Is the infinity pool's edge still visible and defining the boundary between the water and the surrounding landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool is visible but has been transformed into a stone surface with carved designs that resemble water swirls, along with a decorative relief on the wall. The original infinity pool edge defining the boundary between the water and landscape is not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman still positioned centrally in the pool, maintaining her original orientation relative to the pool's edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is positioned near the center of the rounded pool. Her orientation seems compatible with the central positioning relative to the pool's new stone relief scenario, but not precisely at the edge, as defined by the original infinity pool.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the traditional-style buildings with tiered roofs still visible in the background, integrated into the stone relief design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has entirely changed to include a stone relief with a carved depiction, replacing the landscape with trees and buildings found in Image A. There are no visible traditional-style buildings with tiered roofs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dense tropical foliage, including palm trees, still present in the background, albeit reimagined as part of the stone relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a stone relief with various motifs and figures, including plants and animals. While some foliage elements have been carved onto the relief, the dense tropical foliage with palm trees from Image A is not directly reimagined; thus, it doesn't maintain its original presence.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scene retain a bright and clear lighting effect, consistent with the original sunny day atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B possesses a warm, natural stone color reflecting sunlight, aligning an atmosphere similar to a bright and sunny day. This suggests a bright and clear lighting effect is maintained.",
