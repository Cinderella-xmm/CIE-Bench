    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly eight upright objects arranged in a tight vertical cluster within the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three prominent upright objects within the container. These objects are decorative and feature crystal-like designs with colorful gemstone-like tops. There are not eight objects but only three, which are arranged vertically. Thus, the claim of having exactly eight upright objects is incorrect.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a bed of small, uniformly shaped spherical objects filling the lower portion of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the container is filled with small, uniformly shaped spherical objects that resemble pearls. These pearls serve as a foundational layer within the container. Therefore, it is accurate to say that there is a bed of such spherical objects.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a decorative band located precisely at the upper rim of the container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no distinct decorative band at the upper rim of the container. The rim appears clear without any lace or ribbon decoration. The design elements are on the container itself rather than a separate band.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container is indeed transparent, as evidenced by the clear visibility of the pearls inside and the decorative crystal-like objects protruding from it. The transparency allows one to see both the content and the intricate details of the container's interior.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative, crystal-like objects are positioned vertically, and their pointed tips are directed upwards. This orientation is consistent across all three decorative elements inside the container.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there at least three distinct sizes of objects visible in the cluster (large, medium, small)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects visible in the cluster are all similar in size. They are crystal-like sticks with similarly sized gemstone tops. There is no variation in size to classify them into large, medium, and small categories.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the container resting on a flat, horizontal surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the container placed on what appears to be a glass or mirrored surface, which is flat and horizontal. This surface reflects part of the container, indicating that it is positioned on a stable, horizontal surface.",
