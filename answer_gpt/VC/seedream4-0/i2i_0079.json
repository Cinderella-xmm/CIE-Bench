      "question": "Is the black drawer cabinet still present below the round mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a black piece of furniture under the round mirror, but it has changed from a drawer cabinet with six visible drawers to a different design featuring four drawers and a desk-style space. Based on this observation, a comparison with Image A reveals that the original drawer cabinet has been replaced with a new piece of furniture. Thus, the furniture under the mirror in Image B is not the same black drawer cabinet as in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the image still feature a large round mirror above the drawer cabinet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a large round object in the same position above the furniture but, unlike Image A where the object is a mirror, in Image B, the round object looks solid and dark with no reflection. Thus, despite being an object of a similar shape and size, it no longer serves the function of a mirror.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side of the room still shows a large window with visible light coming through, illuminating the space. This configuration matches the presence of natural light entering from the window in Image A. Hence, the natural light from the window is still present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the right side of the furniture piece which replaced the drawer cabinet, there is still a potted plant with long green leaves in a similar position to that in Image A. Thus, the potted plant is indeed still there.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor appears with a light wood texture that resembles the color and pattern observed in Image A. This consistency indicates that the floor's material and textural appearance have not changed between the two images.",
