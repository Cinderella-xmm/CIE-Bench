      "question": "Is the dancerâ€™s right leg raised high with the knee bent and foot pointed down, and is her left arm extended upward while her body leans forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's posture is characterized by her right leg being raised with the knee bent and the foot pointed downward. Her left arm is extended upward, and her body exhibits a slight forward lean. These elements are consistent with a dynamic dance pose, which is often depicted in art forms. Therefore, the visual cues confirm that the dancer has her right leg raised high with the knee bent and foot pointed down, while her left arm is extended upward with the body leaning forward.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dancer with a well-defined beaded top and patterned skirt. The top has horizontal stripes, while the skirt features a geometric design.
