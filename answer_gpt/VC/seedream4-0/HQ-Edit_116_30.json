      "question": "Is the large circular rose window located above the central portal and featuring intricate radial tracery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large circular rose window located centrally above the main entrance of the cathedral-like structure. The radial tracery is evident in its design, characteristic of traditional Gothic architecture. This can be determined by recognizing the shape and detailed patterns commonly associated with rose windows in such structures.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three arched entrances at the base of the façade. The central arch is visibly larger, suggesting symmetry which is typical in cathedral architecture, where the main door is often emphasized and flanked by smaller doors.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, two tall, slender spires are positioned at the outer edges of the central gable, aligning with principles of symmetry often found in Gothic design. Spires add vertical emphasis and are frequently used in this architectural style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The façade of the structure in Image B is designed to be symmetrically balanced around a central vertical axis, typical of Gothic architecture, which seeks not only decorative but structural harmony in design elements.",
