      "question": "Is there a large pink peony flower prominently displayed on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a gold container with floral elements similar to those on a teapot. The container displays a large pink peony flower prominently. World knowledge about peonies as a decorative flower often seen in art and design confirms its identification. Therefore, based on the visual cues in Image B, there is a large pink peony. Since there is no teapot in Image B, the answer is based on the presence of the large pink peony flower on the container rather than a teapot.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a white clustered flower located next to the pink peony on the gold container. Although these floral elements are present, they are not on a teapot, but rather on a container. Therefore, the answer is based on the visibility of the white clustered flower next to the pink peony on the container.",

      "question": "Are there green leaves and stems extending from the base of the flowers on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are green leaves and stems extending from the base of the flowers visible on the container. World knowledge about botanical illustrations typically includes leaves and stems as integral parts of plant depictions. However, since these elements are on a container instead of a teapot, the answer is based on the presence of these green leaves and stems on the container in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features floral elements on the container that include pink and white flowers as well as green leaves, with additional orange-red berry-like accents. This reflects common botanical color palettes possible in floral designs. While the floral elements display these colors, they are not on a teapot in Image B. The answer accounts for the presence of these accents on the container.",

      "question": "Is amber-colored tea visible in all four cups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three cups stacked, a feature often seen in artistic models of tea drinking ware, but only one cup visibly contains amber-colored tea. World knowledge about basic tea rituals suggests that tea is typically brewed and served visibly, but in Image B, tea is only visible in one cup, not all four.",

      "question": "Are the floral elements centrally located on the body of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold container in Image B shows floral elements positioned in the center of its design, mimicking typical symmetry and focal designs seen in art. However, since Image B does not feature a teapot but a container, the answer is based on the central location of floral elements on the container.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a gold container, which lacks any fine mesh or woven-texture appearance, as it presents a smooth metallic surface. World knowledge about various textures like woven patterns often lends to tactile appearances distinct from smooth surfaces. As Image B does not include a teapot, the answer reflects the absence of such texture on the container.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains three cups as part of the scene, not the four cups mentioned in the question. This scene depiction resonates with artistic variations, sometimes excluding elements visible in a different scene setup. Therefore, the answer accounts for the number of cups present in Image B.",
