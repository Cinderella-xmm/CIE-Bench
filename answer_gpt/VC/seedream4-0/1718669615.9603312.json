    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the presence of two parallel railway tracks extending into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a large urn is seen levitating above a patterned surface that resembles flowing lines rather than railway tracks. There are no visible railway tracks present. The scene is artistic and abstract in nature, focusing on the urn as the centerpiece. This suggests a significant alteration from the original setting with railway tracks.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly curved to the right as it recedes into the distance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not depict any railway track. Instead, the surface is characterized by an artistic, abstract pattern of flowing lines that appear to undulate across the landscape. This scene lacks any linear, track-like structures, negating the possibility of any track curvature.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the UFO positioned directly above the central axis of the railway track?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not contain a UFO or railway tracks. Instead, it features a floating urn above a wavy patterned landscape. Since the objects in question are absent, the positioning of a UFO in relation to railway tracks is moot.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizontal line separating the sky from the land in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a distinct line where the patterned land meets the sky. The sky is filled with clouds, providing a visible horizon line that demarcates the sky from the patterned ground. This setup creates a clear separation between the two elements.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the railway track visibly elevated above the surrounding ground level?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image lacks any railway tracks. Therefore, the question of elevation concerning railway tracks can't be evaluated. The undulating patterns in the image suggest a flat surface with no elevated structures reminiscent of railway tracks.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the railway tracks converge toward a single point on the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are no railway tracks to converge at any point. Instead, the scene is dominated by an urn and an abstract patterned landscape. The absence of tracks eliminates the consideration of convergence towards a horizon point.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
