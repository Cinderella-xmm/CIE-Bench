      "question": "Is the lid of the piano open and angled upward, revealing the internal structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is not an actual piano but a gingerbread structure that artistically resembles a piano. There is no functional lid that can open or be angled upward to reveal any internal structure as would be expected in a real piano. Therefore, no lid can be assessed in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the piano have four legs, each ending in a golden caster, supporting the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a gingerbread creation, and it does not have any legs, let alone four legs with golden casters as seen on a real piano. It is a flat decorative piece resting on a surface, unlike the functional design of a piano's legs.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly three pedals positioned in a row beneath the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B lacks the functional elements of a real piano, including the pedals. It is a decorative gingerbread representation that does not feature any piano pedals below the keyboard section as typically seen on a piano.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the keys arranged in the standard piano pattern of alternating white and black keys across the full length of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a representation of piano keys on the gingerbread structure. The keys are made to look like keyboard keys using icing, showing some black and white keys. However, this representation may not accurately reflect the full and precise arrangement of keys as on a real piano. However, since the depiction suggests a typical arrangement, it will be considered as fulfilling this requirement.",

      "question": "Is there a music stand attached to the top front edge of the piano body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a gingerbread structure and does not show any attachment resembling a functional music stand, typically found in pianos, that holds the sheet music on the top front edge of a piano body.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the lid connected to the piano body via a visible hinge mechanism near the rear edge of the keyboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no actual lid mechanism present, as the object is a decorative gingerbread creation. Therefore, there is no visible hinge mechanism that would connect a lid to a piano body.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the piano maintain the same elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a gingerbread structure that imitates some features of a piano, but it lacks the elongated, curved-body silhouette and proportional dimensions found in a real piano shown in Image A. In image B, the silhouette and dimensions are more abstract and decorative.",
