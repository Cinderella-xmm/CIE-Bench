      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both women are visibly holding tennis rackets.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tennis court with surfaces that do not have the typical green color commonly associated with hard tennis courts; instead, it features a unique sandy, earthy texture, possibly indicative of a clay court or artistic rendition. The boundary lines appear faded or modified, differing from traditional white lines on a green court, indicative of an artistic transformation from Image A.",
