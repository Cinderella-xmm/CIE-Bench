        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the mirror frame surrounding the image of the cityscape retains its narrow, metallic appearance. Given the warm tone reflective of gold, combined with the mirror's previous appearance, it is reasonable to conclude that the mirror frame is still gold. Comparing with Image A, the frame encasing the mirror before the edit was gold, confirming that the same frame is present in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the faucets on the sink maintain their metallic shine with a warm tint, typical of brass finishes.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one can observe the pattern of veins across the countertop, characteristic of marble's natural appearance. Marble typically features distinctive veining patterns which are still evident in the edited image. Comparing to Image A, the countertop had a similar marble texture, indicating it remains unchanged through the edit and thus is still present in Image B.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wall surrounding the mirror and adjacent features with a consistent light, neutral hue. This gray tone is typically found in modern interior design due to its subtlety and versatility. Upon comparison with Image A, it is evident the wall held this neutral gray color previously, maintaining it consistently in the edited image.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Referring to Image B, through the window on the right side of the image, there remains a discernible presence of trees and foliage outside, characterized by their typical shapes and textures. Image A provides an identical view through the window, indicating no changes were made to this aspect in the edited version. Therefore, the greenery is still visible.",
