      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s right tusk is visible as it protrudes from the upper jaw, which is typical for elephants where the tusks serve various functions including combat and display. The tusk’s visibility in the image suggests that it is not hidden or obscured from view, thus confirming the presence of the right tusk.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears appear slightly opened but not fully fanned out or distinctly extended laterally. Elephants often use their large ears to regulate temperature or display communication signals. However, the visual appearance of the ears in their current position does not indicate a full lateral extension or full fanning.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows wrinkles on various parts of the elephant, including the trunk, around the eyes, and around the joints of the legs, which are characteristic of elephant skin texture. The presence of these wrinkles enhances the realism of the depiction of the elephant’s skin, corroborating a natural attribute often associated with elephants.",
