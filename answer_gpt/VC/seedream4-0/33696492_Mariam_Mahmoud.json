      "question": "Are there exactly three chairs positioned in a row, facing the bookshelf wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several chairs positioned in a row facing the bookshelf area. By visually inspecting the seating arrangement, it is clear that the chairs have unique decorations, including feathers and text, which suggest an artistic environment. There are more than three chairs visible, not exactly three.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there two hanging pendant lights located above the seating area, one closer to the center and one toward the right edge of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a whimsical and magical scene with glowing mushroom-shaped lights hanging from a tree-like canopy rather than typical pendant lights. Instead of traditional pendant lights, there are artistic and creative lighting elements with multiple glowing mushroom lights and flying bird elements.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the floor display a pattern of parallel diagonal shadows cast by sunlight entering from the right side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor does not have a pattern of parallel diagonal shadows typically cast by sunlight. Instead, the area is illuminated in a warm and uniform light, possibly due to the diffused glow from the fanciful mushroom lights and the natural environment depicted.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a full-height wall of wooden shelves running along the left side of the room, divided into multiple evenly spaced rectangular compartments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a bookshelf, it is positioned on the left rather than the right side. The magical atmosphere and forest-like elements interfere with the view of an actually full-height wall of shelves that might be on the left side. Still, shelves with books are visible.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the floor indeed appears to be composed of wooden planks laid horizontally, extending from the foreground to the background. This scene maintains earthy and natural elements throughout, including the flooring.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelves visible are primarily filled with books and not intentionally decorative objects such as a white vase and a blue box with text. The unusual environment focuses more on a naturalistic and literary theme rather than decorative objects.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
