      "question": "Is the clock frame still circular in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame of the clock is observed to be circular, reflecting the typical round shape of a standard clock. The frame is consistent with common expectations of traditional clock designs, maintaining the circular geometry which provides a balanced aesthetic and allows for easy readability. Without context from Image A initially, one would assume this shape is typical for a clock. Comparing to Image A, the clock frame in the original image is also circular, so the shape remains unchanged.",

      "question": "Do the proportions of the clock hands and line markers remain consistent with the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the clock hands and line markers appear proportionate compared to typical clock configurationsâ€”the clock hands are more pronounced, keeping visibility clear against the line markers. Without looking at Image A first, this setup would seem standard. Upon comparison, Image A's clock exhibits similar proportions for hands and markers. Image B maintains these proportions, suggesting consistency.",

      "question": "Is the clock face still white with black line markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a white clock face featuring black line markers, a common contrast choice for clocks to enhance readability and maintain a minimalist design. This color scheme aids in visual clarity. Before examining Image A, this setup would seem typical. Image A, when compared, also shows the same white face with black line markers, indicating no change in color scheme.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there still no numerals on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks numerals on the clock face, an approach often employed in minimalist designs to maintain simplicity and draw focus on the hands and line markers for time reading. Without looking at Image A initially, no numerals would suggest a design choice prioritizing visual simplicity. Image A similarly does not include numerals, confirming that Image B retains the same numeral-less design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock hands and markers positioned relatively the same as in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands and markers are positioned in a typical clock layout where the 12, 3, 6, and 9 positions are marked. The hands are at 10 past 10 positions. Initially examining Image B without Image A context, the positioning appears consistent with typical clock configurations. Comparing to Image A, the hands are positioned the same, indicating consistent alignment and placement.",
