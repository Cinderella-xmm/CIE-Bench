    "Question": "Q1: Are the two visible dark brown wooden ceiling beams, one running diagonally and one vertically, present and positioned as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible wooden ceiling beams as the image is of an underwater scene with a jellyfish. Image A does feature ceiling beams as it shows an indoor setting with a hanging lantern. Comparing this to Image B, the absence of such a setting means that these beams are not present or positioned in any form as they are in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the white, hand-textured stucco wall visible on the left side of the image, showing irregular surface imperfections and subtle brushwork marks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is underwater, focusing on a jellyfish, and does not feature any walls. Image A has a clearly defined indoor wall with texture, but such architectural elements do not exist in Image B's underwater context.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the shadow pattern on the ceiling and wall composed of a radial, star-shaped lattice formed by the lantern’s cut-out design, matching the exact geometric configuration of the lantern’s panels?",
    "explanation": "Image B is of an underwater scene with a jellyfish and does not include any shadows or patterns that resemble those from a lantern. Image A shows complex shadow patterns due to the lantern's design, which are absent from the jellyfish-centered image in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the corner where the white wall meets the wooden ceiling clearly visible, forming a sharp right-angle edge at the upper left portion of the image?",
    "explanation": "Since Image B depicts an underwater scene with a focus on a jellyfish, there is no architectural element like walls or ceilings present to form a corner as described. Image A features this architectural feature, but such a corner is irrelevant in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the metal chain, consisting of small linked rings, visibly connecting the top of the lantern to the ceiling fixture?",
    "explanation": "Image B focuses on a jellyfish in an underwater setting, without any signs of a lantern or metal chain. Image A shows a metal chain for a hanging lantern, but this context does not apply to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the light emanate from within the central chamber of the lantern, creating a bright focal point that radiates outward through the perforated panels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene involved is underwater with a jellyfish, not featuring any lantern or light source with perforated panels as does Image A. Since there is no lantern in Image B, such a lighting effect cannot be present.",
    "answer": "No"
