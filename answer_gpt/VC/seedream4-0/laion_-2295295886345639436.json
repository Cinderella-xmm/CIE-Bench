      "question": "Is the mouth wide open in a roaring expression with visible teeth and tongue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the figures are depicted with facial expressions that traditionally convey exertion or strength. The modern-era figure, while lifting weights, has a face that suggest such expressions. Given the posture of displaying strength or effort, it's plausible the mouth is wide open in a roaring expression, though the depiction may not show detailed features like teeth and tongue due to illustration style, but the open mouth fit with the roaring expression expected from visual knowledge of exertive poses.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes narrowed and focused, indicating anger or exertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For illustrations that depict strength, exertion, or battle such as the one seen in the edited image, the figures are typically animated with expressions of determination or focus. The implied focus and effort of the modern-era weightlifter could suggest narrowed eyes, which is a common feature in illustrating scenarios involving exertion or concentration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the head have a balding crown with hair along the sides and back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the modern-era figure appears to have a full head of hair, as does the antiquity figure. The character wearing a helmet in the medieval setting typically would have shaved or kept short hair for practical reasons, but the illustration doesnâ€™t show a balding crown. Using the visual cues of the illustration style, there are no markers or design callbacks to the visual trope of balding crowns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the jawline strong and angular, with a defined chin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Illustrations related to strength themes often emphasize certain physical traits such as a strong, angular jawline and a defined chin, as part of the visual shorthand for exaggerated masculinity and power. The figures depicted carry a stylistic representation of strength where such features are typically present.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head located at the top center of the figure, aligned with the spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual design of human character figures, heads are typically placed in anatomical positions that make sense, such as centrally over the torso aligned with the spine to maintain proportion and continuity in illustration. This alignment assists in the depiction of energy distribution along the body's frame in poses of exertion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the visual depiction styled as the evolution of strength, the modern era figure, often linked culturally to ideals of physical fitness, is depicted with clean shaven features as part of standard contemporary presentation, showing that the facial features do not include extra facial hair like a beard or mustache.",
