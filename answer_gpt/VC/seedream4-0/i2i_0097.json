      "question": "Does the plate retain its circular shape and raised rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate is observed to have a smooth circular outline, and the raised rim is clearly visible, which is a common design for plates. This matches the general understanding and appearance of a traditional plate, typically featuring a round shape with a slightly elevated edge to prevent items from sliding off.",

      "question": "Is the plate still white in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate is a solid white, without any visible tints or coloration deviations. White is a common choice for dinnerware as it presents a neutral background that can highlight the food being served.",

      "question": "Does the spoon retain its metallic finish and reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon appears to have a metallic sheen and a reflective surface, typical characteristics of metal cutlery which allows it to reflect light and objects. These characteristics are consistent with what might be expected for a regular metal spoon.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon is positioned along the vertical axis, centered within the plate. This vertical orientation is common when presenting or displaying cutlery on a plate, usually for aesthetic or organizational purposes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the plate and the spoon appear to be placed at the center of the image, which is a standard compositional choice for ensuring balance and symmetry in imagery. This central positioning helps focus attention on the subjects.",
