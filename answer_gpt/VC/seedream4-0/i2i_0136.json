      "question": "Does the edited image retain the green stem at the top of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a keychain fashioned to look like an orange. It has a clearly visible green plastic stem at the top of the keychain, which mimics the natural green stem found on actual oranges. This detail is preserved from the original context of what an orange typically looks like.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glossy texture of the orange still present on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B has a smooth and shiny plastic surface that reflects light, which gives it a glossy appearance. This glossy texture aligns with the concept of being shiny but is different from the natural glossy texture of an orange. Nevertheless, it retains a similar reflective characteristic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the keychain primarily colored in an orange hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B is predominantly orange, matching the color of an actual orange fruit. This suggests that the color theme has been retained even in the model.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surface imperfections and texture patterns of the orange persist on the keychain model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain exhibits a smooth and featureless surface without the bumpy texture and imperfections typical of an orange fruit's skin as seen in Image A. The keychain's surface is uniformly polished, indicating the absence of these natural patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain a proportional size and shape relative to the plate it rests on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the keychain in Image B appears to occupy a similar amount of space on the plate as the orange does in Image A. Therefore, the size and shape of the keychain are proportionate to the plate, maintaining the relative dimensions.",
