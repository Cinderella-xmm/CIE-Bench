    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four dragons, one in each quadrant of the cover?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, there are definitely four dragon figures present, each located around a central circular compass-like motif. This arrangement and the presence of four dragons are visible from the visual cues provided in the image, where the wooden puzzle piece design forms a quadrantal pattern around the central circular element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a central circular compass composed of concentric rings with inscribed characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central circle resembles a compass-like object but does not have any inscribed characters or concentric rings visible. Its design appears more simplistic, reflecting a wooden construction without markings or detailed inscriptions like those typically found on a compass with functional or decorative rings.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a star-shaped pointer located at the center of the compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a star-shaped ornamentation at the center of the circular motif, which resembles a pointer. This is a decorative element commonly associated with compass designs, and its presence is evident in the edited image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dragons arranged symmetrically around the central compass, with each facing toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons appear to be symmetrically arranged around the central circular puzzle piece. However, the dragons are not all strictly facing towards the center; their orientation seems more aligned with the outer edges than directly facing the central element. Typically, symmetry would imply direct central orientation, and this is not entirely depicted in the edited image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragons separated by cross-shaped lines dividing the cover into four equal quadrants?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the setup suggests quadrants formed by the central circular star and dragon placement, there are no visible cross-shaped lines or strict division separating the dragons into quadrants. Instead, it is the placement of the dragons and the circle that implies division rather than explicit line separators.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there Chinese characters inscribed within the concentric rings of the central compass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no Chinese characters or detailed inscriptions within the circular motif in Image B. The design is a wooden puzzle piece structure lacking any form of writing or intricate detailing that would resemble inscribed characters typical in cultural or compass designs.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the dragons have coiled bodies with raised heads and extended claws, consistent with traditional Chinese dragon depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon figures display some elements of traditional dragon design, such as coiled bodies and raised heads. However, the rendition is stylized into puzzle shapes with parts missing or altered, impacting the integrity of the full traditional depiction, particularly regarding claws and detailed features.",
