      "question": "Does the image retain the stark black-and-white contrast characteristic of the zebra's stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra retains its distinct black-and-white striped pattern, which is characteristic of zebras, indicative of high contrast in its coat. This pattern is still evident across the body and mane, maintaining the stark separation between black and white areas as seen in nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the zebra's mane still upright and striped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the zebra's mane appears to be upright and retains the striped pattern. The mane follows the typical zebra style, with alternating stripes similar to the body's coloration. By comparing it with Image A, the characteristics of an upright and striped mane are preserved in the edited version.",

      "question": "Are the zebra's ears still pointed and visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are notable and visible, retaining their pointed shape. Ears being pointed and sticking out is a common feature seen in zebras. When compared with Image A, the characteristic shape and visibility of the ears are consistent even after editing, confirming their presence.",

      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a grazing posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the zebra in a position typical of grazing, with its head down and directed towards the ground. This posture is commonly associated with grazing in animals such as zebras, illustrating their typical feeding behavior. The posture seen is relatively unchanged from Image A, where the zebra is also bent down grazing.",

      "question": "Is the background still primarily composed of green grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is notably different from that in Image A. While Image A presents a consistent green grass background, Image B features a surreal background with bold black-and-white radial patterns mimicking zebra stripes, and patches of grass interspersed among them. The dominant color and texture now significantly deviate from the original green grass composition seen in Image A.",
