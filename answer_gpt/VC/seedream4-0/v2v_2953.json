      "question": "Is the glass still recognizable as a standard cocktail glass with a cylindrical shape and a flat base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that resembles the glass is made entirely of clay, but it maintains a cylindrical shape with a flat base typical of a standard cocktail glass. The visual cues such as the round and vertical sides of the glass suggest it is meant to mimic the original glass shape, despite being a clay representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible ice cubes in the glass, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clay glass contains block-like shapes that represent ice cubes. Although they are stylized and not made of ice, their cubical form and placement inside the clay glass indicate they are meant to depict ice cubes, maintaining the appearance of a chilled beverage.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a slice of lime garnishing the rim of the glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clay object shaped like a lime slice perched on the edge of the clay glass, closely imitating the visual characteristics of a real lime wedge. The placement and shape are consistent with the typical garnish a lime provides on a cocktail.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a metallic straw inserted into the cocktail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the clay drink, there is a cylindrical clay shape that simulates a straw, but it is made of the same material as the rest of the objects and does not have the visual cues of a metallic sheen or texture that a metallic straw would have. Therefore, the clay representation doesn't indicate a metallic straw.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the surface beneath the cocktail retain a polished wooden texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface under the clay glass in Image B is rendered in clay, lacking a polished texture. While it mimics the layout of a wooden surface, it doesn't have the refined detail or gloss that would indicate a polished wooden texture within the clay context.",
