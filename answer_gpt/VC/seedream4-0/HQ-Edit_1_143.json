      "question": "Is the scientist depicted with her right hand holding a pipette or similar instrument, angled toward the test tubes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is illustrated as holding a pipette or similar instrument in her right hand. This is a common depiction in scientific illustrations to signify involvement in laboratory work. The instrument appears angled toward the test tubes illustrated in proximity, which suggests an active laboratory experiment. This conclusion is drawn by recognizing the typical laboratory setting and the usage of such instruments.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple test tubes arranged in metal racks, containing teal or greenish-blue liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple test tubes are evident and appear to be organized in metal racks. They contain liquid colored in teal or greenish-blue. This setting is typical of scientific laboratories where experiments are conducted, using metal racks for stability and organization. The color helps depict the typical look of reactive or testing solutions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a microscope visible on the right side of the workbench, with an eyepiece and stage clearly defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a laboratory scene, and while there are laboratory instruments like test tubes and a possible pipette, a microscope is not visible on the right side. The setup is stylized and simplified for illustrative purposes as it's more diagrammatic with textual and graphical elements. Microscopes typically have specific features like an eyepiece and stage, which are not visibly defined here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two digital screens in the background displaying circular, intricate, symmetrical molecular or crystalline patterns in blue-green tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is stylized with digital elements as part of the design but doesn't show actual digital screens with intricate molecular patterns. It retains an illustrative, graphical style which focuses more on textual elements and simple icons/graphics, contrasting with the realism that would display detailed molecular patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scientist wear a white lab coat and round-framed glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is illustrated with a white lab coat, a common depiction for someone working in a laboratory setting to symbolize professionalism and hygiene. The glasses are round-framed, aligning with typical representations of lab personnel or scientists in illustrations.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the liquids in the test tubes colored in shades of teal or greenish-blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B depicts the liquid in test tubes as shades of teal or greenish-blue, reinforcing the scientific and experimental environment typical in laboratories where solutions are often portrayed in vivid colors for visual effect and differentiation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the scientist positioned in front of the test tubes, with the microscope to her right and digital screens behind her?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustrated Image B, the scientist is positioned with test tubes, seemingly in front, and graphics are used in lieu of realistic digital screens, fitting the illustrative style. The absence of a visible microscope specifically positioned to the right indicates a different setup focusing more on educational or schematic representation rather than a realistic lab layout.",
