      "question": "Is the sandwich cross-section with layered ingredients clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is illustrated in a cartoon style that accentuates the different layers of ingredients through vibrant colors and distinct lines. This style typically emphasizes details and elements within the image. Therefore, combined with the clarity of depiction, the sandwich cross-section with ingredients such as lettuce, cheese, and meat is clearly discernible, even more so than in a realistic photo where textures may blend.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich bread retain its golden-brown crust appearance despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style maintains the golden-brown coloration of the sandwich bread, using warm colors that replicate the original appearance. The stylized approach usually ensures that key characteristics like color are preserved to convey the intended essence of the object. Comparing to Image A, which shows a real sandwich bread with a similar crust color, the cartoon style in Image B retains this trait effectively.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich remain on the white, rectangular plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is depicted resting on a white rectangular plate, consistent with visual cues seen in the cartoon style. This hints at maintaining the composition elements from Image A, where the sandwich is similarly placed on a white plate. The illustrators often preserve major compositional elements to ensure recognizability and coherence within the artwork.",

      "question": "Does the background still depict a wooden table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandwich and plate on a stylized depiction of a wooden table surface. The cartoon effect uses distinct brown tones and linear patterns that mimic the look of wood, suggesting an intentional representation of a wooden table. Comparing to Image A, where the wooden texture is realistic, Image B keeps the background's conceptual consistency despite stylistic alterations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sandwich positioned centrally on the plate as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the sandwich positioning that follows the central arrangement seen in Image A. As per common compositional practice, such positioning is retained to keep focus on the subject, which is often centrally located to maintain balance and visibility. Thus, Image B maintains the positioning of the sandwich similar to the original.",
