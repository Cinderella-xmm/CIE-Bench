        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a metallic item shaped like a boat with the word 'BENTLY' engraved on its side.

      "question": "Is the \"BENTLEY GREENWICH\" text visible on the rear license plate area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a metallic object without any features related to a car, such as a rear license plate area. Instead of a car's typical elements or text like 'BENTLEY GREENWICH,' it features the word 'BENTLY' on its side, suggesting it is not a vehicle part. Thus, the 'BENTLEY GREENWICH' text is not present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main object in Image B is a metallic boat model with a shiny, reflective surface resembling polished chrome or silver metal. Although distinct from a vehicle, the primary color design can be described as silver metallic. To answer, although it's not a vehicle, the color itself is observed as metallic silver.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sleek metallic boat model rather than a vehicle. The boat's design features reflective surfaces with no distinct chrome trim line along what would be considered a vehicle's lower side. Instead, the surface design is smooth and uniformly reflective. Therefore, no continuous chrome trim line is visible.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object, a metallic boat model, is positioned on a circular black platform, as indicated by its placement on crystal glass stands on the platform for display. This setting is suitable for showcasing detailed items like model boats or cars in showrooms.",
