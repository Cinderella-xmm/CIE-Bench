    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the three figures positioned such that one is on the left, one in the center, and one on the right from the viewer's perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three figures are positioned so that one appears on the left, one in the middle, and one on the right. This conclusion is drawn from the relative positions as viewed from the front, which is a common arrangement in group compositions.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central figure standing fully upright with both feet on the rock and facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is depicted standing upright with armor that suggests a forward-facing stance. The position of the feet is likely on the rocks given the stance and visual cues of balance and symmetry in typical defensive or regal postures.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ocean visible in the background behind the figures, with waves breaking against rocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting behind the figures shows the ocean visible with wave activity. The rocks and the sea waves are depicted just as they would be visible in natural coastal environments, enhancing the dramatic scenery.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the figures standing on dark, jagged rock formations in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the figures standing on dark, rugged rock formations. This is visible from the rough texture and the jagged outlines of the rocks beneath them, adding to the dramatic and rugged coastal scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sun positioned directly behind the central figure, creating a bright glow between his legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the bright glow suggests the sun is behind the central figure. This bright area between his legs is enhanced by the sunset, commonly known to produce glowing effects around objects, which is consistent with the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear horizon line separating the sky from the ocean in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line is visible as a distinct separation between the sky and the ocean in the background, typical in ocean landscapes to mark the boundary between sea and sky, enhancing the depth of the scene.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the figure on the right have long, wavy hair extending past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure on the right with armor, which may obscure typical features like hair. However, based on the visual depiction, armor designs or the context may suggest longer elements mimicking or substituting for long hair. Without specific hair depiction, we assume it is interpreted through armor decor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the figure on the left have curly, light brown hair reaching past the shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure on the left has armor, which typically covers such features as hair. However, the intricate designs of armor can sometimes incorporate details reminiscent of hair strands, indicating an interpretation of such features through creative structural design.",
