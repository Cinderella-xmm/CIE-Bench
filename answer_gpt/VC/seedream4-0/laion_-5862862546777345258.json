      "question": "Is the central arched doorway with a cross above it present in the same position on the church facade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the replica displays an arched doorway at the center of the church facade with a cross above it. Comparing to Image A, the original also presents the church with a similar architectural feature in the same position. Hence, the central arched doorway with the cross above is consistent in both images, indicating that the edited image maintains this design element from the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there is a round window directly above the central doorway on the facade of the church model. In Image A, the original photo, there is also a round window positioned directly above the central doorway. This suggests that both images depict the round window in the same position, right above the doorway.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows a bell tower with a dome and spire situated above the church's roof as part of the miniature model's design. Visual examination of Image A reveals that the original church structure also features a bell tower with a dome and spire above its roof. Therefore, this architectural composition is consistently featured in both the edited and original images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature representation of white umbrellas placed over tables to the left of the church model. In Image A, the actual setting also has white umbrellas over tables located to the left side of the church. Both images share this detail, indicating the feature is accurately replicated in the model.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small crystal-like model of a tree positioned near where the café tables are placed, to the left of the church within the dome. However, Image A shows a real tree with foliage situated near the café. Both images have a tree in the same general area, maintaining continuity in layout representation, although presented with different materials in the model.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B does not display any features resembling curved stone steps leading up to the church entrance on the right side within the dome setting. In contrast, Image A, the original, shows curved stone steps on the right side. Therefore, the edited model does not replicate this element of the architecture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of any building with blue-and-white tiled walls and black metal balconies visible to the left of the church model. Image A showcases such a building located to the left of the church. Thus, this particular architectural feature is absent in the edited, miniature version.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B of the model shows a small cross at the top of the bell tower within the intricately designed dome. Image A also presents a similar structural detail where a cross is positioned at the top of the bell tower, suggesting both images share this architectural feature.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows a portion of the church roof model covered with red tiles under the clear enclosure. Similarly, in Image A, the church's roof also appears to be covered in red tiles. Both images thus faithfully maintain this aspect of the church's roof in their respective representations.",
