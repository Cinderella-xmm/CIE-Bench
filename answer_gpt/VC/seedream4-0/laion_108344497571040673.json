      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly two kittens in the image, one standing and one seated inside the cart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what might appear to be kittens are actually plush toy figures. The standing figure resembles an orange cat-like stuffed toy, and another resembling a white cat-like stuffed toy is seated inside the cart. These are not real kittens but plush representations designed to mimic the appearance of kittens.",

      "question": "Is the cart red and made of wire mesh?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cart is visually identified as being red and crafted in a style similar to a wire mesh structure. This observation aligns with knowledge that toy shopping carts often use wire mesh designs for a miniaturized representation of real shopping carts.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange plush toy resembling a kitten has its 'paws' positioned on the handle of the red cart in a posture that imitates holding or resting on the cart's handle, which is a typical playful representation of a cat interacting with objects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the layout of the white plush toy, it is entirely seated within the confines of the basket of the cart, suggesting it is properly contained as such would be expected for carrying a small-sized plush figure in relation to the cart's size.",
      "weight": 3,

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a light-colored fabric beneath the seated plush toy (white kitten), and this appears to have a slight pinkish hue, suggesting a pink blanket is present in the toy setup to enhance the realism of the scene.",

        "No"
      ],
