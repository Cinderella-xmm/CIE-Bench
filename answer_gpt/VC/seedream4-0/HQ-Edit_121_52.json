      "question": "Is the astronaut's face visible through a clear, circular helmet visor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the helmet visor is consistent with a clear, circular design that generally allows the observer to see the astronaut’s face inside. Given the standard design of astronaut helmets, it is expected that the visor would be transparent to provide visibility. Therefore, by considering the design characteristics and the partial visibility of the face, the conclusion is that it is indeed a clear visor.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a red, white, and blue American flag patch located on the left shoulder of the suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B depicts a spacesuit, it's common for such suits to include national insignia, like a flag. The American flag, often shown with red, white, and blue, is a recognizable symbol usually positioned on the left shoulder. Despite artistic editing, the presence of color and stripe hints strongly towards this flag patch.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a large, boxy life-support pack attached to the astronaut’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a squares outline on the back of the suit, suggesting the presence of a large, boxy structure commonly associated with life-support systems in spacesuits. These life-support packs are fundamental for space missions, providing necessary supplies like oxygen.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible segmented joints at the elbows and knees of the spacesuit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the suit includes visible lines and divisions around the elbow and knee areas, suggesting segmentation. Such segmentation allows movement and flexibility in real spacesuits. Thus, based on the observed structure, it implies the presence of segmented joints.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible dust being kicked up from the lunar surface beneath the astronaut’s right boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any dust effects around the right boot of the astronaut. The design focuses on the artistic expression rather than realistic environmental interaction with lunar dust.",

      "question": "Is a bright, spherical Earth visible in the sky behind the astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a spherical object in the sky which appears similar to the artistic depiction of celestial bodies. However, this object is not representative of Earth as typically shown with recognizable features and colors.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the helmet shaped as a smooth, circular dome with a reflective outer surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The helmet in Image B indeed appears to be smoothly rounded and dome-shaped, as typical astronaut helmets are designed for streamlined protection and visibility. There is no prominent indication of a reflective surface here as it is more in line with stylized artwork.",
