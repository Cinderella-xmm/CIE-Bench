      "question": "Is the woman centrally positioned in the image and raising a glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is prominently positioned toward the right side of the image but occupies a significant portion of the foreground, which suggests central importance. Her arm is raised, holding a glass. Combining this with common photographic composition where subjects can be centrally important without being perfectly centered, it's reasonable to conclude she is a central figure raising a glass.",

      "question": "Is the wine glass visible in the womanâ€™s hand, containing liquid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hand is clearly holding a glass with a dark liquid visible inside. The transparency of the glass and the liquid color imply wine, adhering to knowledge of how filled wine glasses typically appear.",

      "question": "Are papers visible on the table near the woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, papers are clearly visible on the table in front of the woman. They appear as white sheets, which is consistent with how papers look in an indoor setting combined with world knowledge.",

      "question": "Is the setting indoors with visible tables and chairs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows elements characteristic of an indoor environment, such as tables, chairs, and walls. The lighting also supports an indoor setting, reflecting common indoor light sources. Therefore, it can be concluded that the setting is indeed indoors.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there background figures present, even if simplified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several figures depicted in the background. They are simplified and appear more as outlines or sketches, yet they indicate the presence of people. This visual hint, paired with the understanding that group settings often involve multiple people, confirms their presence.",
