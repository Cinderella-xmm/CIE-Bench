      "question": "Is the figure in the top-right corner still shown with its right arm raised high, holding a weapon aloft?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the top-right corner is observed with its right arm raised high, holding a weapon aloft, which visually mirrors its depiction in Image A. Both arms are positioned similarly, signifying an aggressive or attack-ready stance that is typical of warriors in battle. Therefore, the weapon being held aloft in Image B is consistent with the depiction in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the figure in the bottom-left corner still show a hand gripping a curved blade in its right hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the bottom-left corner appears to hold a curved blade in its right hand, consistent with its positioning and form in Image A. The blade, though rendered differently, maintains a similar shape and is gripped in a manner that suggests readiness for use, showing a continuation of the original posture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the bottom-left corner does not appear to be in a kneeling position, unlike Image A where the figure's position suggests a kneel with one knee on the ground. Image B displays this figure standing or in a more upright pose, deviating from the kneeling position observed in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in the top-left corner does not appear to face slightly to the left; instead, its head position suggests a forward direction. This contrasts with the figure's orientation in Image A, where it is turned slightly left while maintaining a connection with the viewer. The edited image alters the perspective, changing the directional focus.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom-right figure in Image B is depicted grasping a long, vertical weapon in its right hand, aligning with the positioning in Image A. Despite changes in design and coloration, the vertical nature and placement are consistent with the original sculpt, indicating continuity in armament handling.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-right figure's left leg does not appear to be bent backward, supporting a forward lunge. Whereas in Image A, the leg placement clearly suggests a lunging action with the leg bent backward. The edited figure does not maintain the same dynamic pose, indicating a shift from the aggressive stance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the bottom-right figure without a skull-shaped pendant visible around the neck, contrasting with Image A where such a detail is integrated as part of the figure's costume design. The edited version omits this decorative element, focusing on colorful variations instead.",
