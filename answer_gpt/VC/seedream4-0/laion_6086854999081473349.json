    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two garage doors positioned side by side on the lower front portion of the cabin, directly beneath the large upper window section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two garage doors are indeed positioned side by side on the lower front portion. Although the visual transformation makes them appear as mystical or enchanted gates with green energy, they remain in the same position as typical garage doors would be. Considering typical cabin designs, such garage doors are usually placed under large windows for aesthetic balance and functionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a large, multi-pane window section with exposed wooden beams located directly above the two garage doors, spanning most of the front width of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large window area directly above the garage doors, which encompasses most of the cabin's front width. The transformation gives the windows an appearance of glowing eyes, but the layout is consistent with a multi-pane section typical in cabin design, meant to allow ample natural light and a scenic view.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a small rectangular window cut into the log wall on the left side of the cabin, near the front corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the left side of the cabin, there is an area that visually resembles a window since it emits a warm light, which aligns with features commonly seen in log cabins. This suggests it is a window, following typical design layouts for such structures.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a doorway located immediately to the right of the small rectangular window on the left side of the cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not specifically depict a doorway immediately to the right of the window on the left side. While mystical elements are present, such as vine-like textures and transformed surface features, a distinct doorway as described is not visibly clear or distinguishable.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a continuous concrete foundation base running beneath the log walls of the cabin, visible along the lower perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the cabin appears overgrown with vines and organic textures, obscuring the traditional concrete foundation base seen in log cabins. While a foundation might exist, it is not visibly distinct due to the artistic transformation.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the cabin oriented such that its front façade is angled slightly toward the right side of the image, with the left side receding into the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images show the cabin angled with the front façade slightly towards the right side, while the left side recedes. This is evidenced by the diminishing perspective of the log wall on the left, a standard depiction in architectural photography to showcase depth.",
