    "Question": "Q1: Are there at least eight distinct horizontal levels stacked vertically along the building facade?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are several distinct horizontal levels visible on the building facade. The levels are marked by the floors of the building. Upon observation, it appears that these levels are repetitive sections stacked one above the other. Based on visual inspection, it is possible to count at least eight levels along the facade, suggesting substantial vertical stacking of the building's design. The visual repetition and symmetry in the facade aid in this count.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a transparent railing structure visible on each balcony, positioned directly outside the windows?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows several balconies with transparent railing structures that are easily identifiable due to their reflective nature and translucency, indicating they are made of glass or a similar transparent material. These railings are positioned directly outside the windows of each level, providing safety while maintaining views from the balcony. This conclusion is based on the typical design and safety features common to modern architectural designs, which integrate such railings with the facade.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the windows on each floor arranged in a continuous, curved arc along the building’s surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows appear to follow the curvature of the building's facade. This curved arc arrangement is a design feature that flows smoothly along the undulating profile of the building, enhancing its aesthetic and structural appeal. The serpentine design of the facade and the integration of windows into this curve are evident from the visual cues which show the seamless continuity of the arcs formed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Can furniture items (such as chairs or tables) be seen inside the rooms through the windows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows do not clearly show internal furnishings such as chairs or tables. While the windows provide some visibility into the rooms, the presence of reflections, lighting conditions, and edited facade features do not provide a clear visual of typical furniture items within the interiors. Thus, one cannot definitively identify furniture items via the window spaces from the angles displayed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the building viewed from a low-angle side perspective, showing its height and curving profile?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits a perspective that highlights the building’s height and its distinctive curving profile. The angle of the shot demonstrates vertical stacking and the side curvature, typical of a low-angle view that accentuates tall structures by positioning the view upward from a relatively low vantage point, capturing the full complexity of the building's facade with its tentacle-like designs flowing vertically.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does each window have a corresponding balcony immediately outside it, aligned horizontally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each window indeed has a corresponding balcony immediately outside it, which is aligned horizontally along each floor. This alignment is common in residential and modern architectural designs where balconies offer outdoor space immediately accessible from adjacent indoor areas, enhancing usability and aesthetic coherence between window and balcony placements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
