      "question": "Is the squirrel standing upright on its hind legs with its front paws clasped together near the chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon squirrel is shown standing upright on its hind legs with a backpack on its back. The front paws are not clasped together; instead, they are positioned more openly in a relaxed, neutral pose. Therefore, this feature does not align with the description in the question.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel have a large, bushy tail that curves upward and outward, extending above the back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel's tail is indeed large, bushy, and curves upward and outward. The tail extends above the squirrel's back, aligning well with the provided description. This judgment is derived from observing the prominent shape and positioning of the tail in the cartoon styling of the image.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ears of the squirrel rounded and positioned on top of the head, with a visible pink inner surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ears are positioned on top of the squirrel's head and have a slightly rounded triangular shape but do not show a visible pink inner surface as described. The ears appear to lack this inner pink coloration, which is a detail often depicted in cartoon animals.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the eyes large, round, dark, and located symmetrically on either side of the face, with visible pupils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon squirrel in Image B has large and round eyes, which are placed symmetrically on either side of the face. The eyes also have visible pupils, consistent with the description in the question. This observation is evident based on how the eyes are drawn in the image.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally smaller than the body, with the tail approximately equal in length to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon squirrel's head is not proportionally smaller than the body; rather, it appears larger compared to a typical real squirrel's proportions due to the exaggerated cartoon design. Additionally, while the squirrel's tail is large and bushy, it does not seem to be exactly equal in length to the body but might be slightly larger. With this reasoning, the description does not align with Image B.",
