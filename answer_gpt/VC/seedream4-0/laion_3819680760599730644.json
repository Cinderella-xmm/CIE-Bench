    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the \"Canon\" logo present in white text on the top of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Canon' logo is clearly visible in white text at the top center of the camera body. My reasoning is based on identifying the logo due to its distinct white color and prominent placement, which is typical for branding on cameras.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the \"SX 60 HS\" text visible in silver lettering on the lower right side of the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'SX 60 HS' text is visible in silver, located at the lower right corner of the camera body. This text indicates the model, and its visibility is verified by observing its placement and reflective lettering, which stands out against the dark background.",
      "weight": 3,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the inscriptions \"CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS\" and \"3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM\" visible around the lens barrel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens details are obscured by the added cartoon elements in the edited image, concealing the specific inscriptions normally found on the lens barrel such as 'CANON ZOOM LENS 65x IS' and '3.8-247.0mm 1:3.4-6.5 USM.' The lens is animated and does not show authentic labeling.",
      "weight": 3,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the textured grip area on the left side of the camera body clearly visible with a pebbled or dimpled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grip area on the left of the camera is visible, but due to stylization with cartoon features, the detailed texture with pebbled or dimpled surface might not be accurately rendered. However, contextually recognizing camera designs, I infer that this detail is not as prominently visible as it is altered by style changes.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mode dial located on the top left of the camera body, near the grip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized cartoon transforms this camera into a character, maintaining less focus on realistic technical details such as the mode dial, which would normally be near the top left of the grip. Thus, its presence is not emphasized due to the aesthetic adjustments.",
      "weight": 2,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a small circular flash unit positioned above the lens on the top center of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flash unit is covered by cartoon elements. The top center of the camera shows a hat instead of a flash unit, indicating a change for thematic integration and does not show a visible flash unit above the lens.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the main body of the camera black in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the cartoon modifications, the main body of the camera maintains its black color, providing consistency in representing the camera's structure in editorial form. The knowledge of cameras typically being black aids in affirming this observation.",
