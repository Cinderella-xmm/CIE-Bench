      "question": "Is the cat's fur pattern composed of dark brown or black stripes over a golden-orange base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur features prominent dark stripes over a lighter golden-orange base. This is a common fur pattern for tabby cats, which often display a contrast between dark stripes and a lighter base.

      "question": "Does the cat have greenish-blue eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B has eyes that visually appear to be a shade of greenish-blue. By combining world knowledge about common eye colors in cats, the mixture of green and blue is a possible eye color for cats, reinforcing the observation of the greenish-blue tint in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is seated such that its front legs are slightly bent, but they aren't crossing over its chest. The position suggests the cat is lounging comfortably. Understanding typical feline resting poses helps determine that the paws are not crossed over the chest.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there don't appear to be square pillows with a red floral pattern on a cream background flanking the cat. Instead, other design elements are present, such as curtains and portraits. This indicates that the pillows described aren't part of Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat's tail in Image B is positioned naturally but doesn't curl along the left side of the settee; instead, it appears positioned on the seat itself, to the cat's left. Observing the seating arrangement and tail position provides clarity on this matter.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating is upholstered in a material that is visibly similar to deep red velvet, fitting the elegant and decorative theme of the room. Understanding typical upholstery materials helps identify this as velvet.",
