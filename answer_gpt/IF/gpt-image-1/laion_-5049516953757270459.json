      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire heart-shaped board composed solely of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire heart-shaped board is visually made up of distinguishable LEGO pieces placed together in a mosaic pattern. The clear visibility of the LEGO studs and the variety of brick colors signify a construction solely made up of LEGO bricks, missing any other materials or elements. Common sense and knowledge of LEGO construction also suggest that such a visible structure typically relies entirely on LEGO bricks. Hence, based on the visual cues, the analysis concludes that the heart-shaped board is entirely formed by LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used to represent the food items colored appropriately to match the original produce (e.g., blue for blueberries, red for tomatoes)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks used as proxies for different food items are colored to correspond accurately with their natural colors, such as blue for blueberries, red for tomatoes, and green for broccoli. This color matching is derived from understanding common produce colors, indicating a careful choice of LEGO brick colors to mimic the original items. This attests to the intention to use LEGO pieces that visually resemble the colors seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are different LEGO brick sizes and shapes used to simulate textures (e.g., smooth bricks for avocado, small round bricks for berries, larger chunky bricks for broccoli)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a variety of LEGO brick sizes and shapes simulates the textures of the food items, where smooth bricks represent the smooth surface of avocado, small round bricks mimic berries, and larger chunky bricks replicate the rough texture of broccoli. This visual strategy effectively conveys the textures and characteristics through selective brick usage, using world knowledge on how LEGO can mimic surface qualities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all food items in the LEGO mosaic have clearly defined and distinct borders separating them from adjacent items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals dedicated boundaries between each food item, achieved via LEGO piece placement and color differentiation, leading to clear, distinct borders much like a traditional mosaic. Understanding that LEGO allows for distinct separation through such traits supports this observation, indicating deliberate spacing and edge definition among items.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the LEGO mosaic remain a perfect heart, matching the original board’s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer silhouette of the LEGO mosaic in Image B retains the heart shape seen in Image A. The structuring of LEGO bricks continuously outlines the heart shape recognizably, which corresponds to the original heart-shaped board seen prior. This indicates an adherence to preserving the shape through sharp, angular placement of bricks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the LEGO mosaic placed on a solid, neutral gray base with no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a solid base plate under the LEGO mosaic presented in a uniform neutral gray, with recognizably minimal texture or pattern aside from the standard LEGO studs. This observation utilizes knowledge about LEGO's base plates, which are typically uniform and simple, enhancing the presentation more akin to a flat canvas.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO mosaic exhibit a clear pixelated, blocky appearance consistent with a LEGO construction, rather than a smooth or realistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's LEGO mosaic displays a pixelated, blocky appearance typical of LEGO constructions, emphasizing a distinct block-based rendering compared to any smooth or photo-realistic style. Awareness of LEGO’s inherent block construction underscores this analysis, as it simplifies forms into pixelated representations rather than detailed realism.",
