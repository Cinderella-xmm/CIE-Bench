      "question": "Are the patterned surfaces of the handbag replaced with sleek geometric silver and turquoise motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the handbag clearly showcases geometric motifs in silver against a turquoise background, which differ from traditional monogram patterns usually seen in high-end brand products like Louis Vuitton. The intricate geometric design suggests a modern reinterpretation with metallic and vibrant tones. This contrasts with the pattern in Image A, which features the classic brown and gold monogram distinctive of Louis Vuitton handbags. This analysis is derived from comparing visual styles typical of high-end fashion brand redesigns and transformations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the leather straps feature metallic accents such as silver trim, hardware, or reflective finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates metal components on the handbag, such as handles and geometric frame edges, but does not show any visible leather straps with metallic accents. While the surface design does include metallic elements, the absence of straps or their detailing makes it unclear whether such features exist in this version. Image A, shows leather straps without these additional metallic features. Thus, my reasoning leads to the conclusion that the edited image does not depict leather straps with metallic accents.",

      "question": "Are there intricate machine-age engravings visible along the edges of the handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays ornate engravings along the edges of the handbag, characterized by precise lines and patterns commonly associated with machine-age aesthetics. Such designs resonate with historical decorative styles where metalwork involved detailed craftsmanship like engraving. In comparison, the original Image A has clean edges without such embellishments, so this is a new addition in the edited design.",

      "question": "Does the overall design exhibit characteristics of Art Deco style, including geometric symmetry, metallic finishes, and refined elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's design is marked by geometric symmetry through its pattern and metallic finishes around the edges, along with a sleek and elegant presentation that reflects Art Deco style principles. The turquoise and silver contrast enhances this sophisticated style. Such elements are not present in Image A, which follows the typical fashion branded handbag pattern without Art Deco characteristics.",

      "question": "Has the structural form and proportions of the handbag been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image B to Image A, the edited version maintains a similar rectangular box shape and the proportional elements seen in the original handbag design. Despite the drastic change in surface patterns and the addition of intricate designs, the core structure and proportions remain intact. This observation is based on visual comparison where both images reflect a boxy handbag structure.",
