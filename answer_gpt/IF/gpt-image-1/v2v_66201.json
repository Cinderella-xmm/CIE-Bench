      "question": "Has the fabric of the Victorian attire been dissolved into cosmic dust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Victorian attire visible in Image A is no longer present. Instead, the area is replaced by what appears to be cosmic dust or nebula-like formations, implying a transformation from solid fabric to an ethereal, cosmic form. This suggests a significant change from Image A, where the attire was solid and consistent with Victorian fashion.",

      "question": "Does the brass scientific instrument exhibit intricate, clockwork tendrils growing from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass scientific instrument, likely present in both images, shows additional details that resemble swirling tendrils or extensions emanating from it. These are not typical features of such instruments and suggest a fantastical or surreal addition to the standard design, contrasting with a more standard appearance in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clockwork tendrils softly grasping the monkey's subtly distorted hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the tendrils are present and originate from the instrument, they do not appear to extend towards or interact with any hands, especially considering the monkey's hands are not visibly altered or in a position where such interaction could take place. Image A provides a clear picture of the hands without interaction, and Image B lacks evidence of such connection, as the hands are not distinctly visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image evoke a profound, dreamlike state characteristic of Surrealism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys a sense of Surrealism through its transformation of solid objects into cosmic and fantastical elements, like the attire dissolving into cosmic dust and the instrument sprouting otherworldly tendrils. These otherworldly transformations deviate from reality, reminiscent of Surrealist art, which often portrays dreamlike and imaginary scenes.",

      "question": "Has the overall composition and positioning of the monkey and the instrument been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The core positions of the monkey and the instrument remain consistent between Images A and B. While details such as the attire and additional elements around the instrument have changed, their relative placement and orientation remain the same, indicating the fundamental composition has been maintained.",
