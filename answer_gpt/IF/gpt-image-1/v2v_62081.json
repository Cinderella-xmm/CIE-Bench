      "question": "Has the portrait been reimagined in a dynamic Xieyi style Chinese ink wash painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a bust-style portrait drawing reminiscent of Chinese ink wash painting, evident through its use of black ink and wash techniques that attempt to capture the essence and spirit of the subject rather than detailed and precise lines. The use of bold and soft strokes, in keeping with the Xieyi technique, contributes to a more dynamic and expressive feel to the imagery.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features and cravat are rendered with varying shades of grey using softer, more nuanced lines and washes, which provides depth and contrast typical in ink wash paintings where subtle gradations are used to evoke details.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of a complex wooden frame; instead, there are simple, dark ink lines providing a border. This is consistent with the transformation of the frame into a more suggestive and minimalist style typical of ink wash art.",
