      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the only remaining elements in the image the red-and-gray train and the \"STOP\" sign, presented with geometric color blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and the 'STOP' sign are simplified into geometric shapes and solid colors, which suggests a reduction of details to focus on these elements, presented in a stylized manner. This implies that other elements from a more complex scene have been removed or simplified to emphasize these two main components.",

      "question": "Is there no depiction of people in the image whatsoever?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized and simplified representation of a train and a 'STOP' sign with no visible depiction of people. The image style focuses on shapes and colors without any details indicating human figures, aligning with the design's minimalistic aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background consist solely of green mountain outlines and track lines with no additional details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is abstracted into simple green mountain outlines and track lines, emphasizing a simplistic and minimalistic style. This lack of detail suggests that the focus is on the primary elements of the train and the sign with the rest being non-detailed outlines.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is mainly composed of blues and greens, which are typically considered cool tones. Even the gray and red of the train are set against a background that is dominated by blues and greens, maintaining a cool-toned aesthetic overall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses clear, bold geometric shapes and simplified elements akin to the style used in traffic safety signage, which is designed to convey information quickly and efficiently. The use of a 'STOP' sign further reinforces this parallel in style and function.",
