      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in a curled-up posture as the tail and body are positioned closely together in a similar form to a real cat's resting position. Using common sense knowledge, a curled pose is typical for a resting cat, and the illustration captures this natural behavior. Hence, the cat maintains a curled-up posture in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the cat's fur represented by simple gradient color blocks in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the cat's fur is depicted using simple color gradients instead of intricate details. The illustration style uses broad, flat color areas with some minimal shading to give the appearance of fur texture while maintaining simplicity. This approach is characteristic of many illustrated designs which use color blocks for a sleek look.",

      "question": "Has the car been simplified to a curved surface with only reflection lines present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no explicit depiction of a car; instead, the edited version solely focuses on the cat on a flat surface that might represent the car's hood. The illustration does not attempt to depict any detailed elements or recognizably distinct features of a car. Reflection lines are present to imply a surface, but not necessarily a car specifically.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, displays the cat in a sticker format that features an irregular shape, closely following the silhouette of the cat and its resting surface. The thick white outline is visible around this shape, typical for a sticker. The checkered pattern indicates a transparent background, which is used to show the sticker's final appearance without a solid backing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is portrayed with simple lines, minimal shading, and flat colors, which are components of a minimalist illustration style. This approach is often used for designs intended for stickers, especially those in a 'chibi' style, which emphasize cute and simplified representations.",
