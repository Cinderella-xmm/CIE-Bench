    "Question": "Q1: Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the laboratory scientist has stylized and simplified features. The lines are cleaner, and proportions are less realistic, indicating a semi-cartoon style often used for illustrations like calendar designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the laboratory apparatus such as test tubes and monitors are simplified with minimal detail, following a more stylized representation that does not emphasize refinement typically seen in highly detailed imagery.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors are teal and white. These colors lend a clean, clinical aesthetic often associated with scientific visuals, creating a sleek look for the calendar design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image include multiple monthly sections, each featuring a different scientific motif such as molecular structures or data patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a single integrated design that does not show multiple monthly sections with different motifs. Instead, the design incorporates general scientific motifs throughout the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",
    "explanation": "Image B features the word 'CALENDAR' at the top, but it is presented in a simple, bold font without any futuristic or tech-inspired effects. There are no headers above each monthly section as the calendar design is integrated as one piece.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are scientific motifs such as circular diagrams on the monitors, which resemble data visualization patterns. These are visibly integrated into the design to convey a scientific theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the image display a polished, reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper?",
    "explanation": "Image B is rendered with a matte, illustrated aesthetic rather than a polished, reflective one. It is designed to look like it could be printed on typical paper, not high-quality gloss paper.",
    "answer": "No"
