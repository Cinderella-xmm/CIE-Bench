      "question": "Has the word “Shine” been added to the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror prominently features the word 'Shine' across its surface. The cursive, illuminated style suggests an addition to the typical reflective surface of a mirror. By comparison, Image A shows a plain mirror without any text. This indicates the word 'Shine' is indeed an addition in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the word “Shine” positioned centrally in the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'Shine' is evenly spaced and centered both vertically and horizontally onto the mirror's surface. This central alignment can be concluded from the equal spacing visible around the word within the square shape. There's no text in Image A, which ensures 'Shine' was included centrally in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the word “Shine” appear to have a backlit glowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' in Image B is outlined with a bright, glowing effect, resembling the illumination seen in neon signs. This glow aligns with the light reflection on the mirror, embedding the word with a backlit appearance, in contrast to Image A, which has no such light effect or text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cursive font of 'Shine' provides an elegant yet simple aesthetic, fitting well with the minimalistic style displayed throughout the bathroom in Image B. The white glow adds to the cozy yet pristine ambiance, reinforcing modern design elements of the room. The absence of intricate patterns supports the visual coherence with the existing modern decor.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of 'Shine' in Image B appears well-balanced within the bathroom context. Its placement above the sink and its size comparable to the mirror create visual harmony without overwhelming other elements. The lighting effect complements the other decor's simplicity, maintaining the modern and clean aesthetic.",
