      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tank's body composed entirely of olive and dark green LEGO bricks, showing a blocky, modular construction consistent with LEGO building style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank is clearly constructed using LEGO bricks, evident from its blocky and modular look, which is characteristic of LEGO constructions. The colors of the LEGO bricks are primarily olive and dark green, mimicking the color scheme of a military vehicle. This visual cue of blockiness and the specific color scheme confirm that the tank is made of LEGO bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the orange tiger decal been replaced with a pattern made of colorful LEGO plates forming a whimsical tiger face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger face is made up of LEGO plates with a playful design using the signature block modularity of LEGO. The face is both geometric and colorful, indicating it is constructed from individual LEGO plates rather than a traditional decal as seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tankâ€™s treads made of textured LEGO bricks with visible studs and blocky segments, rather than continuous rubber tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank treads are made of small, interconnected LEGO bricks, which are segmented and studded, typical of LEGO designs. This is unlike conventional continuous rubber tracks, sharing the common LEGO aesthetic of visible studs and blockiness.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tank positioned on a smooth, flat wooden platform without visible gravel or irregular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank rests on a flat wooden platform that appears smooth and devoid of any irregularities like gravel or uneven boundaries. This is a contrast to Image A, where the tank is on a bed of gravel.",

      "question": "Is there a back panel made of green LEGO bricks behind the tank, designed to mimic foliage and replace the natural tree background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of natural trees, the backdrop consists of a panel constructed using green LEGO bricks. The panel is arranged to mimic foliage, using the modular characteristics of LEGO, which provides a simplified and blocky representation of a natural scene.",
