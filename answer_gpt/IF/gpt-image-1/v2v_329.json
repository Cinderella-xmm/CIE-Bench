      "question": "Are the bicycles depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles have exaggerated and simplified features characteristic of chibi style, such as larger and rounder parts, softer edges, and a playful, cartoonish appearance. This style simplifies real-world objects into more whimsical and cute forms, which is apparent in the rounded tires, thick frames, and smooth textures in the depiction of the bicycles.",

      "question": "Have the bicycles retained their original arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles are arranged in a similar grouping and orientation as in Image A, maintaining their relative positions and alignment. The spatial configuration where the bicycles are placed next to each other and slightly angled is consistent between the two images.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the bicycles identical to those in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles have colors that are similar in hue to those in Image A, with each bicycle appearing in roughly the same color scheme as its corresponding counterpart in the original image. Despite the stylized rendering, the edited image retains these color attributes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bicycles retain their original design details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A features bicycles with detailed elements such as gears, chains, and realistic frame proportions, Image B simplifies these into a chibi style with fewer details and more stylized features. The design detail in terms of realistic elements like spokes and frame construction is lost in the transition to a chibi style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall scene composition and lighting consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The general composition of Image B, with the window and lighting from behind the bicycles, is similar to Image A. However, the edited image has a more cartoonish look with softened lighting and fewer intricate light-shadow interactions, creating an overall more stylized lighting than the realistic depiction in Image A.",
