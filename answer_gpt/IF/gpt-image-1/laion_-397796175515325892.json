      "question": "Has the church been rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified shapes and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is depicted with bold outlines, exaggerated features, and a simplified structure, which are characteristics of a semi-cartoon style. The architectural elements are represented in a stylized manner with less detail compared to a realistic portrayal, indicating a move towards a more artistic and animated rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the architectural elements of the church perfectly symmetrical on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the church displays a symmetrical design, which is common in artistic illustrations aiming for an aesthetic appeal. Each side of the church mirrors the other, maintaining a harmonious balance in the architectural depiction. This symmetry aligns with stylistic choices often used in illustrative art to create a pleasing and uniform appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic gold accents applied specifically to the spires and upper parts of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spires and upper parts of the church in Image B appear to have a bright golden tone. This is indicative of an editorial choice to emphasize these areas with metallic gold hues. However, the tones are more artistic and flat rather than metallic, given the illustrative nature of the image.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the proportion of the church been altered to enhance its sense of grandeur and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church maintains relatively similar proportions to what would be expected for such architecture in an artistic depiction. The stylization does not necessarily enhance its grandeur or scale; instead, it provides a more consistent and balanced artistic representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a celestial-themed design featuring elements like stars, galaxies, or cosmic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background filled with stars and celestial elements, such as a moon, against a dark blue sky. This is a departure from a typical church setting and suggests a celestial theme, evoking cosmic and night sky vibes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image (Image B) shows three identical images of the church, each presented in a separate frame with a black border. This setup creates the appearance of three distinct architectural art prints.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the three prints arranged in a trifold album format, with a central fold and two outer panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the three prints are placed side-by-side, they are individually framed and do not appear to be connected in a foldable manner that would suggest a trifold album. Each is displayed separately and distinctly.",
