      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, it is evident that the diagram has been transformed into a comic illustration. The visual style features cartoon animals and humorous text, indicating a storytelling approach rather than a structured diagram. In contrast, Image A follows a formal, circular diagram format typical of data processing workflows. The option 'Yes' accurately reflects the transformation into a whimsical and playful comic style.",

      "question": "Is there a wise owl wearing glasses positioned in the Business Understanding section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cartoon owl wearing glasses is situated in the top left corner with a speech bubble related to 'Business Understanding,' suggesting its wise character. Image A has no animals; its 'Business Understanding' section simply contains a text box. The inclusion of an owl alludes to common portrayals of owls as wise creatures, reinforcing the narrative theme. The option 'Yes' is correct based on the depiction in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the connections between processes represented by playful paths like stepping stones or bridges instead of arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases connections between sections using winding paths—a visual departure from Image A's straightforward arrows. They symbolize a playful and whimsical adventure approach to the data journey. Such storytelling elements reflect a narrative akin to fantasy paths rather than linear arrows, leading to the correct choice being 'Yes'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Data' is creatively illustrated as a glowing pile of crystals—the focal point for surrounding cartoon characters. This portrayal indicates a treasure-like concept, embodying the whimsical style. Image A features a standard database icon, reflecting an abstract representation of data. The transformation in Image B leads to the correct answer: 'Yes'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, a banner clearly displays the text 'The Adventures of Data Journey!', framing the narrative-driven illustration with a thematic heading. This creative element is absent in Image A, which presents data process titles straightforwardly. The inclusion in Image B points to the correct choice being 'Yes'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each animal character in Image B has a speech bubble that humorously describes their contributions in the data journey, such as 'I dig data acorns!'—contributing to the lighthearted tone. Image A lacks such personalizations or narrative lines, presenting terms formally. Hence, for Image B, the answer is 'Yes'.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a vibrant color palette and the characters reflect a storybook style, indicating creative illustration. Image A sticks to formal colors and diagrammatic depiction. Thus, the option 'Yes' accurately describes the visual style of Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears square with an equal height and width, not exhibiting a 3:4 aspect ratio. Image A visually shows more height than width, resembling a 3:4 format. Thus, based on Image B's display, the correct answer is 'No'.",
