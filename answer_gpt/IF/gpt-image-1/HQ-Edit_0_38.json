      "question": "Is the image framed with a vintage-style border typical of playing cards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an evident border surrounding the entire illustration. This border features intricate designs and symbols, such as the letter 'K' and decorative motifs that are reminiscent of playing cards, specifically a vintage style. This analysis is based on the familiarity with playing card design and the characteristic ornamental elements often found on them.",

      "question": "Do the grape clusters feature visible golden highlights on their surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grape clusters are depicted in a sepia tone consistent with the entire image's earthy color scheme, which eliminates the possibility of golden highlights appearing visually. Understanding the visual effect of sepia tones, which are monochromatic and don’t accommodate the appearance of gold hues, supports this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the cane been transformed into a design resembling a twisted vine with organic, plant-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cane design features distinct twisting and curved patterns, suggesting an organic form that could resemble a vine or similar plant-like structure. This is concluded from the similarity of the cane's shape to natural forms seen in plant life, which matches the description of a twisted vine design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there faint ornate filigree patterns visible within the fabric of the man’s suit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit appears to have a richly detailed surface texture that includes what could be ornate filigree patterns. These are visible upon closer inspection and suggest an intricate design. The appearance supports the presence of filigree, known for its delicate and elaborate curvaceous patterns often used to embellish items.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are vineyard-themed symbols present in one or more corners of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains elements that are clearly vineyard-related, such as grape clusters. However, a careful inspection of the corners shows specific symbols that relate to vintage design rather than explicitly vineyard-themed symbols. The border doesn’t exhibit symbols directly tied to vineyard themes upon analysis.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image maintain an overall color palette dominated by earthy tones such as browns, greens, and deep reds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme of Image B is primarily sepia-toned, focusing on shades of brown which fall under earthy tones. This conclusion is based on the uniform dominance of this color throughout the image, which excludes other colors such as greens or reds, typical of earthy palettes.",
