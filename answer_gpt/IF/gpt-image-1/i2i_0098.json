      "question": "Is the mirror still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space that was previously occupied by the mirror is now occupied by an art piece. This indicates that the mirror is no longer present in the image. My judgment is based on observing an absence of reflective surfaces where the mirror was originally located.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the area previously occupied by the mirror been replaced with a minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where the mirror used to be, there is now an art piece depicting a landscape with simple, abstract patterns and neutral colors. This suggests that the area has been replaced with minimalist landscape wall art, given the simplicity and abstraction in the design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the minimalist landscape wall art appear to have a fabric canvas material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the wall art in Image B appears textured, which is characteristic of fabric canvas material. This texture is visible in the patterns that resemble those typically found in canvas art pieces, suggesting that the material used for the wall art is fabric canvas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "A comparison between Image A and Image B shows that the sink, vase, lights, and tiles remain unchanged. The only intentional alteration is the replacement of the mirror with wall art. Therefore, no other parts of the bathroom have been altered in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question": "Are there any additional elements or changes in the image beyond removing the mirror and replacing it with a minimalist landscape wall art on a fabric canvas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B in comparison to Image A reveals no additional alterations beyond replacing the mirror with the wall art. The sink, vase, lights, and tiles appear to be consistent between the images, indicating no other changes have been made.",
