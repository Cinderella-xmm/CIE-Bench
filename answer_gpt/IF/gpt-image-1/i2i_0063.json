      "question": "Does the edited image feature a horse in the original pose as the protagonist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the protagonist is a cat, specifically a black and white cat with a collar, positioned in the center of a post-apocalyptic setting. There is no horse present in the image, indicating that the subject of the image is still the cat and not a horse.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cat prominently positioned in front of a background comprising ruined buildings and rubble, all under a gloomy sky, which are common elements of a post-apocalyptic setting. Therefore, the background is indeed designed to resemble a ruined city.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, the text 'LAST RIDE' is prominently displayed in a stylized font that fits the aesthetic of a dramatic, possibly cinematic context. The overall color scheme of the image, including the title, appears to be dominated by cool tones, such as muted blues and greys, typical of cool-tone filters.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An examination of Image B does not reveal any film rating label, such as a typical MPAA rating or similar indication, in its layout or any corner. Such labels are often found at the bottom of movie posters; however, this image lacks that feature.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) has a consistent cool-tone filter applied across its entire surface. This is evident from the shading and coloring, which predominantly utilize a palette consisting of blues and greys, imparting a somewhat cold, dystopian feel to the image.",
