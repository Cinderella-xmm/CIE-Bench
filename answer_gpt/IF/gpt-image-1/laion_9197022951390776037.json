      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label retains its original design with a small icon of a scarecrow face near the upper part of the text 'SCARECROW,' but it does not feature prominent facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth within the icon.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B depicts grapevines with clusters of purple grapes and swirling vine tendrils, set against a backdrop that appears misty, contributing to a magical and enchanted atmosphere.
