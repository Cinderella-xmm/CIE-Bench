      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays characteristics typical of a medieval castle hall, such as stone walls and Gothic arches, which replace the wooden bookshelves and plaster walls seen in Image A.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace is considerably more ornate, with elaborate stone carvings and a grand arch design, indicative of medieval architecture.
