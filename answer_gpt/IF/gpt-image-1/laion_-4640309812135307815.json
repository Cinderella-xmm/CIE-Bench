      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see what appears to be a flacon made out of translucent red-tinted glass. This bottle replaces the concept of fabric with glass, forming a solid object. The visual cues suggest a transition from wearable attire to a decorative or functional object, thus it seems the dress concept has been artistically reimagined into a glass container.",
