        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "Despite the blurred face in both images, the presence of a beard can be discerned. However, due to the face blur, specific details like glasses or expressions cannot be confidently compared. Therefore, it's not possible to confirm that facial features remained unchanged without considering the blur.",
