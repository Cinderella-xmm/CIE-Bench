    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the scene (road, sky, trees, poles) fragmented into geometric shapes such as polygons, rectangles, and triangles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual analysis reveals that all elements, including the road, sky, trees, and poles, are constructed from various geometric shapes like polygons and triangles. This abstraction technique simplifies complex natural forms into basic geometric components, which is often used in styles like cubism or certain digital art forms. The entire scene maintains this fragmented aesthetic, creating a uniform geometric composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the road composed of angular, non-smooth sections instead of a smooth, curving surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road is depicted as a series of interlocking angular shapes. The once smooth curves of a natural road are broken into straight-edged geometric sections. This transformation into angular, fragmented forms is indicative of cubist or geometric abstraction styles, where natural curvatures are reimagined as linear components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clouds represented as overlapping quadrilateral or polygonal shapes rather than soft, natural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays clouds as a collection of geometric shapes, including quadrilateral and polygonal forms. These sharp-edged shapes replace the organic, smooth transitions typically found in natural clouds with angular, abstract representations, characteristic of cubism and other geometric styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the telegraph poles rendered in a stylized, geometric form using angular lines and shapes rather than realistic proportions and textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The telegraph poles in Image B are shown as simplified geometric forms, lacking the detailed textures or proportions that characterize real-world poles. These are depicted as straight, angular lines, maintaining the consistent geometric style of the image, which is in line with abstract and cubism art approaches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as abstract triangular shapes rather than natural, rounded tree canopies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are reduced to abstract, triangular shapes. This representation diverges from the natural, rounded visuals typically associated with tree canopies, offering an interpretation that aligns with geometric abstraction and art styles focusing on shape and form simplification.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image use only muted greens, grays, and deep yellows, avoiding bright or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of Image B consists exclusively of muted tones. Greens, grays, and deep yellows dominate the composition, avoiding any bright or saturated hues. This choice contributes to the overall mood and aesthetic uniformity of the abstract geometric style used in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clear sense of depth and perspective in the scene, with the road leading toward a distant horizon despite the geometric abstraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the geometric abstraction in Image B, there remains a clear sense of depth and perspective. The road is meticulously constructed using geometric shapes that converge toward a distant point on the horizon, allowing for the perception of depth common in linear perspective despite the stylistic abstraction.",
