        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows different parts of the sandwich as color blocks with minimal texture, each layer is uniform in color such as the bun, lettuce, and meat, without realistic detailing or texturing that would emphasize distinct physical layers or textures.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce on the sandwich is illustrated with large, smooth, curved green shapes that lack intricate detailing and texture. This simplification into smeared shapes is part of the cartoon or painting style that uses broad strokes.",
