      "question": "Is the bridge transformed into a creature resembling an ancient forest guardian, with organic features replacing mechanical ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a large creature resembling an ancient forest guardian. This creature has a humanoid structure with large, wooden limbs and a body covered in moss, making it look organic and alive. This is a distinct departure from the steel and mechanical structure of the bridge seen in Image A. The transformation from an inorganic bridge to an organic creature is evident with features that are more typical of mythical forest entities rather than man-made structures.",

      "question": "Are the bridge towers transformed into wooden limbs covered in foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge towers are no longer visible as distinct structural elements. Instead, they seem to be transformed into large wooden limbs that form part of a creature. These limbs are covered in what looks like foliage and moss, exaggerating their organic nature. In comparison, Image A shows distinct metallic bridge towers with no organic elements, marking a significant transformation in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the bridge arches reshaped into a ribcage-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's torso area features an arrangement that resembles a ribcage, with wooden sections aligning in a similar style. Image A has traditional bridge arches integral to its structure. In Image B, these arches' function and appearance are morphed into the creature's anatomical structure, suggesting a transformation from mechanical to biomimicry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bridge cables replaced with vine-like tendrils that support the creatureâ€™s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the typical bridge cables seen in Image A. Instead, there are vine-like structures surrounding the creature, which further accentuate its forest-based nature and give the impression of providing support akin to how the cables would have functioned structurally in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone bases replaced with moss-covered roots extending into the flowing stream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part of the creature extends into the flowing stream with structures resembling roots covered in moss. This is a clear change from Image A, where the bridge is grounded with solid stone bases. The moss-covered roots in Image B integrate with the natural surroundings, indicating transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a distinct head formed with a bark-like texture, contributing to its ancient forest creature appearance. Additionally, it possesses eyes that glow with an emerald hue, which is a marked difference from any element present in Image A, which has no organic features or glowing components.",
