      "question": "Is the overall scene rendered in a pop art style with bright, flat colors and comic book-like aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the use of bright and flat colors typical of pop art, such as primary colors red, blue, and yellow. The design mimics comic book aesthetics with bold outlines and halftone patterns, which are characteristic features of pop art. By examining these visual cues, we can deduce that the scene is indeed rendered in a pop art style.",

      "question": "Does the train feature bold primary colors (such as red, blue, or yellow) and halftone dot patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B is depicted using bold primary colors, specifically red, blue, and yellow. Additionally, halftone dot patterns are present on the surface. These visual elements are prominent and align with typical pop art characteristics, underscoring the graphic style applied to the train.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the barn’s wooden texture been replaced with stylized geometric shapes instead of realistic wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn’s surface is shown using stylized geometric shapes and does not display any realistic wood grain texture. This stylistic choice aligns with the pop art aesthetic, where geometrical and abstract patterns replace realistic textures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees and grass in Image B are depicted as vibrant, abstract bursts with sharp, exaggerated shapes instead of realistic representations. These graphical bursts contribute to the pop art aesthetic, emphasizing bold colors and simplified forms.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, all major elements such as the train, barn, tracks, and foliage are outlined using sharp black lines. This outlining is a common technique in comic book and pop art designs to create distinct separations between elements and enhance the graphic style.",
