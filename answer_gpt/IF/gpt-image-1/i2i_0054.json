      "question": "Is the background changed to a matte solid gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a consistent matte solid gray. This type of background is common in minimalistic design to ensure focus on the main object without distractions. The color is uniform and without patterns or gradients, indicating a matte solid appearance.",

      "question": "Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shadow cast on the gray background, just below the metal stand holding the banana. Shadows add depth to objects and can enhance a three-dimensional feel in illustrations or graphical images. The shadow is noticeable and clearly depicted alongside the stand.",

      "question": "Are the banana shape and metal stand curves highlighted effectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana and metal stand have distinct, smooth curves that are effectively highlighted. The curves are crisp and clear, emphasizing the shape and contours. This level of detail enhances the visual interest of the objects against a minimalistic background, demonstrating effective highlighting.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a minimalistic design without unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a single banana and metal stand against a plain gray background, with no additional elements present. This suggests that the image maintains a focus on simplicity and functionality, elements typical of minimalistic design. The lack of distractions or additional items supports this interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Minimalistic design assets often prioritize simplicity, a focus on essential elements, and the use of negative space. Image B exhibits these characteristics through the use of a plain background, a single object focus (banana on a stand), and overall simplicity. The visuals support a clean and uncluttered appearance, fulfilling the criteria for minimalistic design standards.",
