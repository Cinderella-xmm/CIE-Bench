      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe positioned on a surface that has a texture and color consistent with wood. The brownish appearance and grain-like details suggest a wooden tabletop setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sheep in Image B is characterized by exaggerated proportions and simplified features typical of chibi-style models, giving it a cute and cartoonish appearance. Similarly, the clock is stylized with a simple design layout that complements the chibi aesthetic, all indicative of chibi-style 3D models.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is positioned beside the clock but does not appear to be leaning against it. The sheep stands independently, with a distinct space between it and the clock, which suggests it is merely standing next to the clock rather than leaning on it.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates numerous small white particles suspended within the globe, around the sheep and clock. These resemble snowflakes, which are a typical feature of snow globes, often designed to simulate snowfall when shaken.",
