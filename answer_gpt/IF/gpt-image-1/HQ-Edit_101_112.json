      "question": "Does the image exhibit flat color fields, bold outlines, and minimal shading consistent with traditional Japanese woodblock prints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are uniformly applied with clear boundaries and without gradient transitions, which is typical of traditional woodblock prints. These prints are characterized by bold outlines that define forms and minimal to no use of shading, relying instead on color contrast and pattern. The figure, landscape, and elements like the kimono and basket all have this flat, outlined style, which is consistent with the Ukiyo-e style of art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figureâ€™s facial expression calm and composed, with eyes slightly closed or downcast, indicating serene contemplation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B focuses on the overall demeanor of the figure, which is seated with hands clasped and posture straight. This posture typically conveys calmness and composure. However, since the face is blurred and facial expressions cannot be discerned, we cannot definitively judge the expression of serene contemplation based on facial features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the kimono display intricate patterns (e.g., floral, geometric) and use vibrant, saturated colors instead of plain dark tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono exhibits intricate floral patterns with vivid, saturated colors. The use of orange, blue, and other contrasting colors enhances the visual appeal and highlights the traditional design, typical of Japanese kimonos. This style contrasts with plain dark kimonos and aligns with traditional Japanese art's aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms and the bridge rendered with stylized, non-realistic forms typical of Japanese woodblock prints (e.g., simplified petals, symmetrical bridge structure)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms have a stylized appearance with simplified shapes, lacking intricate detail, which is a hallmark of traditional Japanese woodblock prints. The bridge and landscape are represented with clean lines and symmetrical, balanced structures rather than realistic detail, typical of Japanese art's aesthetic interpretation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire image have a visible textured, matte surface resembling aged paper, with no glossy or reflective areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a visible texture throughout the image, reminiscent of the rough grain of aged paper used in woodblock prints. This texture gives the artwork a matte finish, contrasting sharply with the glossy or reflective qualities seen in modern imagery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basket is depicted with a minimalistic style, using simple lines and basic forms. This simplification focuses on reducing detail while retaining recognizable form, aligning with the aesthetic principles of traditional Japanese woodblock art that emphasize stylization over intricate realism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of elements creates a sense of balance and harmony. Both sides of the composition, including the figure, bench, cherry blossoms, and bridge, are arranged proportionally, achieving symmetry. This balance is a key element in creating a sense of visual harmony, typical in traditional Japanese artwork.",
