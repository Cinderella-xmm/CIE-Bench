      "question": "Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged to form the shape of a person with a distinguishable head, torso, arms, and legs. The arrangement is stylized and simplistic, but the visual cues such as the overall stance, appendages, and placement on the plate create a recognizable anthropomorphic figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right arm (from the viewer's perspective) is constructed using a series of sushi pieces that extend upward and away from the torso, suggesting that the right arm of the figure is lifted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left arm (from the viewer's perspective) is visible and made of sushi pieces that extend outward from the torso. This indicates that the figure includes a left arm that is appropriately positioned relative to the body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two separate lines of sushi pieces extend downward from the torso, representing two separate legs. These are distinguishable from each other, and from the rest of the body, signifying both legs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head of the person figure represented by sushi pieces and distinguishable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head is represented by a single, round sushi piece placed at the top of the figure. This distinguishes it from the torso and limbs, making it clearly identifiable as the head of the person figure.",
