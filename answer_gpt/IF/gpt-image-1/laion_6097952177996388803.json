    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the mountain range as a mythical beast with identifiable features such as a head, body, or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a mythical beast is prominently featured, consisting of a head with distinct facial features, including eyes, nose, and mouth, accompanied by large horns. This composition clearly represents a living creature-like form with identifiable features that can be associated with a mythical entity. Such transformation from a natural landscape to an imaginative beast suggests a creative interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the two highest peaks appear as large, curved, horn-like structures emerging from the top of the mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the tallest peaks have been replaced or reimagined as horns on the head of the mythical beast. These horns are large, prominent, and curved, clearly differing from natural mountain peaks and suggestive of an animalistic trait, aligning with the mythical portrayal.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky surfaces of the mountains visibly altered to resemble a textured hide, such as scaly or rugged skin-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the beast possessing a surface texture that mimics the appearance of rugged, scaly, or skin-like patterns. This extensive texturing imbues the creature with a naturalistic look, mimicking the textures one might associate with a mythical or legendary creature, rather than the typical rocky surface of a mountain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible mossy patterns and root-like structures along the mountain slopes that resemble tangled fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features a creature whose form is colored and textured to resemble moss-covered surfaces and root-like structures. The coloration and the added detail resemble fur, highlighting tangled and organic elements that contribute to a naturalistic and fantastical appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the valleys been transformed into sinewy, muscular structures that follow the natural contours of the land but resemble biological musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image focuses on the upper body of the mythical creature and does not explicitly display valley regions. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence of valleys being manipulated into sinewy, muscular structures that mirror land contours.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible earthy aura surrounding or emanating from the mythical beast, such as warm tones, glowing mist, or ambient light suggesting an organic, natural presence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in the edited image is enveloped with warm earthy tones and fog that enhances its organic appearance, creating an aura that seems to emanate a natural presence. This supports the transformation from a mere landscape to a mythical entity with an ethereal and ecological essence.",
