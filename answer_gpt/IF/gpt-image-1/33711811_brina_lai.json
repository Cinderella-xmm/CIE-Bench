        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy mountain peaks have been transformed into structures that resemble large wings with sharp, jagged edges, consistent with those typically seen in depictions of mythical creatures such as dragons.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant houses are not discernible, and instead, the area they would occupy appears to be part of a continuous body structure of a mythical beast. There is an impression of a segmented, spine-like structure running along the creature's body.",
