    "Question": "Q1: Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stork's feathers are clearly depicted with metallic plates, which appear to be riveted or segmented. This visual cue, indicative of a mechanical or industrial interpretation, supports the notion that the natural feathers have been substituted with metal, consistent with elements typical in Steampunk design, which often incorporates metal and mechanical textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
