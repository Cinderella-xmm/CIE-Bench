    "Question": "Q1: Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is clearly constructed using LEGO-style bricks, characterized by modularity and the distinct, visible edges typical of LEGO bricks. The entire structure, from the seat to the base, consists of these elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "The seat and backrest in Image B are rendered in black and consist of LEGO-style bricks, showcasing a smooth and sleek appearance typical of LEGO constructions. The use of LEGO bricks gives these parts a distinct, uniform look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests are black with a structural look, while the base is primarily rendered in a light gray color, rather than silver. The LEGO-style bricks define the structure, but the specific shade is more aligned with gray rather than a metallic silver.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
    "explanation": "The wheels in Image B appear as solid gray, modular pieces that fit the LEGO aesthetic. They are not translucent but have a consistent gray appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the seat and backrest constructed with visibly layered LEGO bricks. The transitions between each brick are sharp rather than smooth gradients, following the typical construction of LEGO models.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
    "explanation": "The armrests in Image B are composed of straightforward, angular LEGO-style bricks. They feature linear designs with no complex padding or curves, characteristic of simplified LEGO construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is set against a light, plain background, suggesting a tabletop or flat surface. The inherent neutrality and uniform lighting suggest a white tabletop beneath the chair.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
    "explanation": "Image B prominently displays the chair's construction using LEGO-style bricks. The clean lines and visible edges are characteristic of LEGO's geometric and modular quality, which is a hallmark of this type of construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
