      "question": "Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B shows four separate figures of a person playing tennis, each representing a different stage in the sequence of hitting a tennis ball. The first frame depicts the preparation stage with the player readying their position. The second and third frames illustrate the swing and the hit stages, respectively, where the player's posture shows the progression through the swing and contacting the ball. The fourth frame represents the follow-through, where the player's posture suggests completion of the hitting motion. This aligns with common stages of a tennis swing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the figures is sharply outlined with clear lines, and there is minimal use of shading or coloring within the forms. This is characteristic of a clean line art style, emphasizing contours and outlines rather than texture or color gradients.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a monochrome fill, utilizing a single color palette without variations in hue beyond different tones of the same color. This method gives the illustration a uniform, cohesive look, consistent with a monochromatic scheme.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is non-existent, allowing the focus to remain completely on the figures. This removes any extraneous details that might distract from the subject, which is a technique used to emphasize the main content or subject of the illustration.",
