    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the individual been transformed into a cartoon character with exaggerated facial features such as oversized eyes, elongated nose, or enlarged head relative to body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the transformation captures a stylized representation, using smoother surfaces and enhanced colors, there is no indication of exaggerated facial features nor a disproportionately large head or body akin to typical cartoon characters. Traditional portrait aspects still persist.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hair significantly larger and composed of numerous elegant, tightly curled sections that extend beyond the natural shape seen in the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the hair appears carefully styled, with each curl distinct and prominent, potentially larger and more defined than seen in traditional portraits, like Image A. This creates a more stylized and exaggerated effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly showcases the red coat with detailed golden embroidery featuring elaborate patterns, possibly more pronounced or vivid than in traditional artwork like Image A.",

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals a prominently styled blue sash across the torso, enhanced in vibrancy, and similar positioning to what is likely found on a similar garment in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a polished appearance with smooth textures and reflective highlights, contributing to a finish reminiscent of a 3D figurine, differing from the traditional canvas textures seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background a smooth gradient of muted colors without distinct objects or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a simple gradient transition, devoid of any distinct objects or visual patterns, providing a clean and modern contrast to the detailed portrait, similar perhaps in composition but differing in texture from the more painterly backgrounds of Image A.",
