      "question": "Are the lily flowers now composed of transparent, amber-tinted crystal-like material with visible jagged facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the lily flowers appear to be composed of a transparent, crystal-like material with an amber tint. The flowers are structured with jagged facets that reflect light, resembling cut crystal or glass. This stylistic interpretation transforms the flowers from their natural form into an artistic representation using reflective materials.",

      "question": "Do the petals retain their original lily shape but appear constructed from layered, sharp-edged crystal facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals maintain their general lily shape, characterized by elongated, pointed ends. However, they now appear constructed from layered crystal facets, which are sharp-edged and reflect light. This gives the impression of a faceted, crafted look while preserving the essential outline of the lily petals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the stems and leaves previously seen in green have been replaced with thin, transparent rods that resemble glass. These rods extend from the base of the bouquet and maintain a delicate, sleek appearance, contrasting with the thicker, organic structures of natural plant stems.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface on which the bouquet rests in Image B is dark and smooth, with visible white veining. These characteristics are typical of black marble surfaces, suggesting that the bouquet is placed on a black marble tabletop, which adds a luxurious feel to the composition.",
