      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two figures have exaggerated features such as large heads and small, rounded bodies, characteristic of chibi art style. Chibi typically involves a cute, stylized representation which is evident here with the simplified facial features and proportions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are depicted with fluffy white coats and contrasting patches which resemble garments rather than human hairstyles.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a pattern behind the characters that looks like the outline of a court, but it's subtle and doesn't appear as a logo. It's more of a decorative background element, not a definite logo.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a white cut-out style border surrounding the characters, a common feature of sticker designs. This border separates the figures from any background, indicating it's been stylized as a sticker.",
