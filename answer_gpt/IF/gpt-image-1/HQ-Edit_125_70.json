        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pegboard background remains primarily grayscale. However, the text 'CARPENTRY' and 'HIGH-END CRAFTSMANSHIP', as well as certain wooden handles, have copper-like tones creating accents. Pegboards typically don't feature graphical enhancements, but these color choices visually highlight specific elements.",
