      "question": "Are there visible gold highlights on the woman's silk robe, particularly along seams, collar, or floral designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe is depicted with a sepia-toned, illustrated pattern. The floral designs and other accents do not have visible gold highlights as the entire image uses a uniform color scheme rather than metallic tones. Therefore, the image does not showcase gold highlights commonly associated with silk fabrics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the book display a layered story scene, such as visible illustrations or figures emerging from its pages in multiple planes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book has an illustration on its visible pages featuring a small figure and additional scene elements, which indicates a narrative aspect. The illustration appears as part of the book's page content and does not provide a multi-plane or layered emerging effect.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bookshelves feature ornate decorative elements such as carved patterns, inlaid designs, or filigree details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelves are stylized and have an illustrative quality, with curves and patterns incorporated into their design. The books themselves show decorative patterns, but the shelves, being part of the overall stylized illustrative style, do not feature three-dimensional ornate elements like carving or inlay seen in realistic shelves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible bookmark panels attached to the book that display vintage tea motifs such as teacups, tea leaves, or traditional tea sets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an area with illustrations on what could be perceived as panels next to the figure. These illustrations include classic tea motifs like teapots and teacups as decorative elements, rather than bookmarks as traditionally placed within a book.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a distinct departure from realism, adopting a semi-cartoon style with stylized features. The smooth outlines, uniform coloring, and illustrative patterns all reflect characteristics typically found in graphics with simplified shading and exaggerated detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hairstyle and posture are depicted in an illustrative, simplified style compared to a realistic rendering. While the overall form is preserved, the style of depiction means some alteration has occurred due to the artistic approach to the image rather than realistic portrayal.",
