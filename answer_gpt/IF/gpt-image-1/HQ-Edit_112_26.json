      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the figurine box in a manner that resembles an isometric view, where the sides of the box are visible and angled in such a way that it gives a three-dimensional perspective. This type of view is common in illustrations and product packaging to provide a comprehensive, visually appealing perspective.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beside the box, there is a glossy chibi-style cat figure, characterized by its exaggerated features and shiny appearance. However, the image does not explicitly show the figure inside the box itself, but rather suggests this figure is representative of the box's contents.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cat figure has notably large, sparkling blue eyes. These eyes have a glossy, reflective finish, making them resemble glass or gemstones, a common trait in chibi or toy designs to exaggerate cuteness and add visual interest.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a realistic depiction of a cat next to the box. Instead, it contains a chibi-style cat figure beside the box, which emphasizes stylized rather than realistic features. Realistic depictions include detailed textures and proportions, which are absent in the chibi figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a chibi-style cat figure with smooth textures rather than detailed fur, and the surrounding does not showcase a wood grain surface. These elements are indicative of a realistic style, which contrasts the stylized, simplified representation in the chibi form.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on displaying a product, the figurine box with a chibi figure, yet it relies on cartoonish and stylized features rather than adhering to a professional, realistic showcase style. The lighting and design choices enhance the artistic style rather than create realistic shadows and lighting.",
