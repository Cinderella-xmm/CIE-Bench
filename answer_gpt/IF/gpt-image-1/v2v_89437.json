    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the black checkmark pathway depicted as tangled and circuitous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathway is shown as a tangled arrangement, unlike a straightforward checkmark. The intertwining pathways demonstrate a complex route, suggesting circuitous complexity. The visual interpretation of the path's design indicates it is far from linear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 'We verify your Document' icon show multiple overlapping stamps of approval?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'We verify your Document' icon indeed features several overlapping 'Approved' stamps. This depiction contrasts with a simpler, singular icon, emphasizing thoroughness or redundancy in the verification process. The overlapping design is visible and unmistakable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visual motifs of entangled red tape woven through the orange circular step markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes red tapes crisscrossing through the orange circular markers, depicting entanglement. These motifs serve as a visual metaphor for bureaucratic challenges, enhancing the complexity depicted in the graphic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the infographic reflect an adaptation to increased bureaucratic complexity for Qatar document processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tangled pathways and entangled red tape motifs in Image B suggest adaptation to heightened complexity in bureaucratic procedures. These elements symbolically convey additional layers in processing, reflecting a conceptual shift towards intricacy when compared to simpler paths.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the infographic maintain coherence and clarity despite the added complexity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the increased complexity in Image B, the clarity is somewhat preserved. While the tangled paths introduce confusion, the consistent iconography and labeling of steps help maintain a semblance of understanding. The added elements don't fully obscure the intended process steps.",
