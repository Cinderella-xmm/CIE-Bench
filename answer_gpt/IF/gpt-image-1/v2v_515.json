      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, we can see a lineup of Russian nesting dolls that are representative of two individuals.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls appear to be resting on a flat surface that resembles a wooden table.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Russian nesting dolls in Image B indeed adopt a chibi-style aesthetic, characterized by exaggerated features such as larger-than-normal heads relative to their bodies and simplified facial and body design. This stylization is typical of chibi art, which aims to evoke cuteness through these disproportionate features.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B's layout, it has a horizontal orientation that appears to fit the aspect ratio of 3:2, which is a common photography format. This ratio traditionally signifies that the width of the image is 1.5 times its height, matching the visual impression given by the proportions of Image B.",
