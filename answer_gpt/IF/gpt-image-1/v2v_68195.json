      "question": "Has the Nebraska Huskers lettering been reshaped to resemble dried corn husks or golden wheat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettering on the dress reads 'Corn Princess' and is stylized in a way that could be interpreted as resembling golden wheat or dried corn husks due to the use of a yellow color and a font reminiscent of straw-like or rustic textures. This suggests a thematic change to relate more to an agrarian or harvest theme compared to the original 'Nebraska Huskers' seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there delicate embroidered motifs of miniature corn cobs and autumn leaves around the gathered waistline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays embroidered motifs of corn cobs and autumn leaves in a yellowish hue around the waistline of the dress. These appear to be deliberate additions for decorative purposes, suggesting an agricultural or autumn theme which is absent in Image A where no such motifs are present.",

      "question": "Has the red fabric been deepened to a rich crimson?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's fabric appears darker and richer in hue than the fabric in Image A. The original red in Image A now looks like a lighter red compared to the deepened, more intense red, almost crimson shade in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gingham patterns on the cuffs and back bow remain sharp and well-defined. This suggests that the patterns have retained a crisp and festive appearance, matching the design style observed in Image A.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close examination of Image B compared to Image A shows that the gingham accents on the cuffs and bow have remained consistent in both pattern and color. There is no noticeable alteration to these elements in comparison to the original image.",
