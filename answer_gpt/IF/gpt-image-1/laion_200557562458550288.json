    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the image been transformed from a flat jersey display into a full promotional poster layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual content has evolved into a dynamic promotional poster setting, showcasing an anthropomorphized jersey riding a bicycle. This layout is quite different from a flat static jersey display seen in Image A, suggesting a transformation into a full-blown promotional design with added elements and context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the jersey as an anthropomorphic cyclist character with a body shape and posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the jersey designed into a character with defined features such as arms, legs, and a bike, indicative of an anthropomorphized entity. This representation deviates from Image A, which exhibits the jersey as a standalone garment, not suggesting any character-like properties.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are facial features (such as eyes, nose, or mouth) present on the chest area where the star was originally located?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation in Image B includes the addition of facial attributes such as eyes and a mouth situated around where the star was originally on the jersey in Image A. This inclusion gives the jersey a animated, lively appearance, contrasting the plain star seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image limited to blue, white, red, and gray, matching the original jersey's color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images predominantly utilize blue, white, red, and gray. Image B stays true to the original jersey color scheme seen in Image A, integrating these colors into its dynamic and promotional illustration style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stylized motion lines or speed effects visible around the anthropomorphic cyclist character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, representations of speed and movement, like motion lines, encircle the anthropomorphic cyclist, imparting a sense of velocity and dynamism. These elements were absent in Image A, which solely focused on the stationary jersey.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently showcases the text 'Ride Like a Star!' using bold, diagonal typography in the bottom left, which complements the vibrant and dynamic nature of the poster. This text is an additional element not present in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall layout combine structured composition (e.g., balanced elements) with energetic visual cues (e.g., motion lines, strong angles)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B successfully integrates a structured composition, balancing the shapes and elements of the cyclist character within the frame, augmented by dynamic visual effects like motion lines. This is in contrast to Image A, which displays a static and straightforward composition.",
