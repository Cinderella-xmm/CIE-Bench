      "question": "Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft appears inside a glass display case as a decorative object rather than attempting to mimic a real-life aircraft. It's presented in a stylized, simplified form characteristic of 3D models used in decorative or illustrative contexts, which indicates it is not meant to be photorealistic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the confined space of the glass display case in Image B, small, stylized clouds are visible, suggesting they are artificial representations designed to complement the aircraft model aesthetically.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the aircraft in Image B reveals an upward diagonal orientation, likely intended to simulate flying or elevation within the constrained design of the display case.",

    },
    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The propellers on the aircraft in Image B exhibit motion blur effects or visual distortions emphasizing spinning motion, typical of graphic representations aiming to depict movement.",
