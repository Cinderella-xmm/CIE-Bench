    "Question": "Q1: Has the diffuse, smoky brown background been replaced with an expansive blackboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the pineapple and what appears to be Albert Einstein is a greenish blackboard filled with mathematical equations and sketches, distinctly different from the diffuse, smoky brown background seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the blackboard intricately covered with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blackboard indeed features chalk-written equations, such as E=mcÂ², and swirling sketches that resemble galaxies, consistent with the scientific theme often associated with Albert Einstein and theoretical physics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple remain consistent after the background change?",
    "explanation": "Despite the background change in Image B, the soft, warm lighting illuminating Albert Einstein and the pineapple appears consistent with Image A, indicating that the lighting has been maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the blackboard exhibit an aged appearance?",
    "explanation": "The blackboard in Image B conveys an aged appearance, characterized by its worn texture and the nostalgic science classroom feel that typically suggest age.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple remained unchanged?",
    "explanation": "The positions and general appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple in Image B are consistent with those in Image A, indicating that they have remained unchanged despite the alteration of the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
