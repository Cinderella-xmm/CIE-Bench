    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a spiral form, which upon closer inspection, reveals the visual characteristics of a serpent. It has a head with reptilian features, such as scales and a dragon-like appearance, instead of an architectural structure. This transformation clearly indicates a shift from a staircase to a serpent creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the structure of the spiral appears to be made up of segmented sections that resemble scales found on a reptile. This segmented pattern is consistent with how scales are commonly depicted on serpentine or reptilian skin.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The railing in the edited image resembles a spine-like structure composed of what looks like vertebrae or bone segments. This visual characteristic follows the spiral path, suggesting a transformation from a typical handrail to an organic, skeletal feature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image exhibits wooden-like textures that mimic a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body. This wood-like pattern is reminiscent of organic and skeletal structures often associated with serpentine creatures in art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays features that appear to be stone-like ridges and rocky textures along the body of the serpent. These raised elements contribute to the creature's reptilian and ancient appearance, enhancing the organic and textured feel.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the spirals are depicted as continuous and flowing coils, which are characteristic of serpent-like forms. This transformation shows a fluid, natural curving motion that resembles the graceful movement of a coiling serpent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent creature exhibit visual traits suggesting antiquity and natural grandeur (such as weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features earthy colors, textured surfaces, and organic forms that are often associated with antiquity and natural grandeur. These traits collectively impart a sense of age, weathering, and a connection to nature, typical of ancient mythical creatures.",
