      "question": "Is the palm tree and cactus positioned within the frame of a Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand. Within the photograph, the palm tree is distinctly visible, but the cactus has been transformed into a chibi-style character, suggesting its presence in the Polaroid frame. The hand holding the photograph indicates a real-world interaction, placing these elements within the Polaroid's boundaries.",

      "question": "Has the cactus been transformed into a 3D chibi-style character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus appears as a cute, character-like figure with exaggerated features including a smiling face and rounded arms, common elements in chibi-style characters. This transformation from a natural plant to a stylized 3D character is evident from its new form as compared to typical cactus representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cactus appear to be stepping out of the Polaroid frame, breaking into the real-world 3D space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style cactus is seen interacting with the Polaroid frame, where parts of the cactus appear outside the frame itself, such as the arms and part of its body. This feature suggests it is breaking the two-dimensional confines of the photograph and stepping into the 3D space of the real world, creating a visual effect of depth and movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image create a whimsical and surreal effect through the combination of the Polaroid frame, the chibi cactus, and the real-world interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses surreal combinations — a Polaroid frame and the transformation of a regular cactus into a chibi-style figure — alongside the interaction with realistic elements like a human hand. This concoction of imagined style and reality results in a whimsical and surreal effect. Such design choices are often used to evoke a playful, otherworldly ambiance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the palm tree still present and unchanged in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm tree in Image B is identical to the one in Image A, situated within the Polaroid frame that is held by the human hand. It retains its original form and placement, as observed in the context of Image B's edited elements. Hence, it is present and appears unchanged.",
