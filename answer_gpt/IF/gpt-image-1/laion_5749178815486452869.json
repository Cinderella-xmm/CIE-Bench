      "question": "Is the green field depicted as a floating island disconnected from any ground or horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green field is presented as a floating island in the sky with no visible connection to any ground or horizon. This setup implies that it defies physics, typical of fantasy themes. Without referring to Image A for comparison, this observation suggests a deliberate stylistic choice to portray a whimsical, surreal environment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers significantly more vibrant and saturated in color compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the yellow and red flowers appear rich and vivid. Without comparison to Image A initially, the artistic style seems to emphasize a bold use of color, contributing to the surreal and vivid look of the scene. In Image A, the flowers are more natural and subdued, making Image B's flowers relatively more vibrant.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the moon been replaced with an oversized apple in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an oversized apple hovering above the floating island, taking a central position in the sky. This contrasts with the moon in Image A, which is large but natural. The apple in Image B is a clear departure from the celestial body, emphasizing surrealism and creativity in its design choice.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the bee and butterfly been replaced with stylized, playful, non-realistic motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bee and butterfly as stylized and playful, unlike their more realistic counterparts in Image A. The bee, with its cartoonish outline, and the butterfly, rendered vibrantly, suggest a shift towards whimsical, non-naturalistic representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the tree been replaced with a hollow geometric structure (e.g., cube, pyramid, or sphere) with visible interior or transparent parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where the tree stood in Image A, there is now a geometric structure reminiscent of an open cube. It contrasts with Image A's natural tree, suggesting a move towards abstract architectural elements in a surreal composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the starry night sky with visible stars and cosmic depth still present and dominant in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the starry night sky remains a dominant element, providing a cosmic backdrop similar to Image A. The deep colors and stars establish a significant portion of the image as the background, maintaining a consistent thematic presence across both images.",
