    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the explosion depicted as a mural painted on a beach wall, rather than occurring naturally in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion is shown with a vibrant and uniform background that suggests artificiality. The clean outlines and the context of the image, which includes the structure on which the explosion appears, indicate it is a mural on a wall. This contrasts with realistic depictions which would include more natural gradients and textures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the explosion and surrounding elements bright and neon-like, consistent with pop art aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a color palette characterized by bright and neon colors such as pink, blue, yellow, and orange, typical of pop art aesthetics. These colors are saturated and designed to grab attention, deviating from naturalistic hues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all major elements (explosion, clouds, palm trees, landforms) have thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion, clouds, palm trees, and landforms all feature thick black outlines, giving them a distinct separation from each other and the background. This is a typical feature in pop art, where bold outlines are used to emphasize shapes and forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the palm trees stylized with exaggerated forms and bold outlines, consistent with pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B are depicted with exaggerated forms and bold outlines. They lack detailed texture and realism, instead acting as stylized graphic symbols that align with pop art characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are geometric patterns (e.g., stripes, grids, polygons) visibly embedded within the cloud formations of the explosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the explosion and clouds in Image B includes various geometric patterns such as stripes and zigzag patterns, which are evident within the design. These are visual elements often employed in pop art to evoke a sense of abstraction and pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the island landscape been transformed into simplified abstract shapes, lacking realistic terrain details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island landscape is presented using simplified and abstract shapes. The terrain lacks details such as texture, shadows, and natural color gradients, instead focusing on basic forms outlined in black and filled with bright colors.",
