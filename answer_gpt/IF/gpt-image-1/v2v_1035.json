      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a set of objects designed in the form of Russian nesting dolls.

      "question": "Are there exactly five nesting dolls arranged in descending sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features five objects clearly arranged in a descending order of size. Starting from the largest doll on the left and moving to the smallest doll on the right, we see each subsequent doll is slightly smaller than the previous one, indicating there are exactly five nesting dolls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are placed on a surface with a wood grain texture and color consistent with a wooden table. The arrangement of the dolls is orderly, with each progressively smaller doll positioned to the right of the larger one, producing a neat presentation. The term 'classy' can refer to the overall elegant appearance of the wooden surface and the clean display.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image have a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Determining the exact aspect ratio of an image based merely on visual inspection can be challenging, but the horizontal format and the proportions suggest an aspect ratio closer to 1:1, which is typical for square images. However, it is not possible to measure precisely without direct tools, hence based purely on observation, it does not appear to have the 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls maintain a chibi style with large heads, small bodies, and simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B exhibit distinct chibi style features: prominent large heads, small bodies, and exaggerated facial features like big eyes. These characteristics align with the chibi art style, which aims to create a cute and endearing appearance through simplification and exaggeration of proportions.",
