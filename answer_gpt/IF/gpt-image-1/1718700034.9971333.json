      "question": "Are the wings replaced with large, angular crystal shards in shades of opal and white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings appear as large, angular structures with crystal-like shards, reflecting hues of opal and white. Such features are consistent with descriptors for crystals and opals, which are often perceived as angular and possessing iridescent qualities. This is a distinct change from the original Image A, where the wings were feathery, soft, and had a more traditional angelic appearance.",

      "question": "Is the hair replaced with golden, leafy strands woven into a crown-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable addition of a crown-like structure made of golden leaves on the head. This is a clear change from Image A, where the hair was simply styled with curls and no additional accessories.

      "question": "Has the shirt been changed to a smooth velvet material while maintaining a white color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the shirt has a texture and sheen indicative of velvet, which is noticeable due to the way light reflects on its surface, suggesting a change in material. Although the brightness suggests a very light color, in contrast to Image A where the shirt appeared as a simple matte fabric, the textures differ greatly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a plain, deep gray with no discernible textures or objects, creating a stark contrast with Image A. Image A had a more intricate and illuminated background that included visible elements. This shift to a minimalist, homogeneous background marks a significant change.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains similar posture and positioning of the figure as the original image. Despite the modifications mentioned in previous questions, there is no indication of changes in posture or positioning between the two images, although facial expressions are not assessable due to the blurred section.",
