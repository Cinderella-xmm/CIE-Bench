    "Question": "Q2: Does the right-side skier cast a shadow that suggests depth and closeness to the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right creates a distinct shadow on the ground in front of them. The shape and position of this shadow are consistent with an object positioned close to a surface, thereby implying depth and proximity to the viewer. This effect is enhanced by the skier's apparent elevation and forward position relative to the snow surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain motion lines or blurring effects around the skier to indicate movement. Instead, the skier appears sharply defined against the background, suggesting a still image without simulated motion effects.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?",
    "explanation": "The perspective in Image B significantly alters the spatial relationship of the skier on the right. The skier emerges from within the framed picture and extends out onto what resembles a continuation of the scene, placing them closer to the viewer than any other elements depicted in the image. This positioning suggests a deliberate editing to create proximity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right is angled forward relative to the assumed plane of the image. This positioning enhances the illusion of movement toward the viewer. The skier's stance and direction of his skis suggest a dynamic posture, leaning forward, which implies a motion toward the front.", 
    "answer": "Yes"
