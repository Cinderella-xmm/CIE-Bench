      "question": "Has the antique clock been transformed into a sentient, mechanical creature resembling a steampunk sentinel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly transformed into a mechanical creature with an anthropomorphic form, resembling a sentinel. The combination of gears, appendages, and a central eye reinforce a steampunk aesthetic typical of sentient-like robots. The analysis is based on visual cues of sentient expression and mechanical design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there gear-based limb-like appendages extending from the clock’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one can observe several appendage structures resembling limbs, which are composed of gears and mechanical parts. This is a common element in steampunk designs, where machinery displays limb-like movements. The visual information clearly shows these mechanical appendages extending from the body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has one of the clock faces been replaced with a monocled eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a central, monocled eye where one would expect a clock face. This visual transformation is indicative of a focus on anthropomorphic features, emphasizing the creature's sentient appearance. The monocle further accentuates this design and is typical within steampunk aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pendulum in Image B is integrated into the design of the mechanical creature with a tail-like appearance, contributing to the overall steampunk style. It retains the characteristic swinging feature, but visually acts as a tail for the creature, enhancing its animated depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dominant hues in Image B consist of brass and copper colors, which are typical of metallic surfaces associated with vintage machinery and steampunk aesthetics. This visual cue suggests the material and color palette employed in the creature’s design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits distinct steam valves located on the corners and joints, with steam visually emanating, a typical feature of steampunk designs. These valves emphasize the mechanical and industrial aspect, contributing to the steampunk sentinel appearance.",
