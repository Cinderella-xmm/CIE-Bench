      "question": "Are the three figures depicted as mythical guardians wearing armor made of oceanic elements such as coral or wave-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are depicted in detailed armor with intricate designs and oceanic themes.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted in striking shades of blue and purple, which enhances the mystical ambiance of the entire scene. Such color choices create a more fantastical backdrop typically associated with mythical or enchanted settings.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the three figures rendered as silhouettes against the enhanced sky due to backlighting from the sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are detailed and not mere silhouettes. Their armor and features are clearly visible with distinct light and shadow contrasts instead of being obscured by backlighting, which indicates they are not meant to be silhouettes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title at the bottom of Image B reads 'Sunset Guardians.' The text is presented in bold serif letters with a texture that can be interpreted as weathered, but there is no additional 'of the Coastlines' segment present in the title. The design does suggest an oceanic theme, but the wording does not align with the question.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features figures with armor characterized by intricate and abstract designs, which might imply some oceanic connection like waves or coral but does not explicitly depict ocean creatures like seahorses, tentacles, or fish scales.",
