    "Question": "Q1: Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left parking meter displays an illustration of a robotic dog where the timer or dial is typically located. This is evident from the visual cue of the dog with robotic features, replacing the area where an analog timer is usually found. Based on the visual cues, the timer has indeed been replaced by the robotic dog illustration.",
