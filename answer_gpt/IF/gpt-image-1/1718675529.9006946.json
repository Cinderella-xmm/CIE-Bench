      "question": "Is the image rendered in a stylized, graphic manner consistent with Art Deco design principles, rather than a photorealistic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays features consistent with Art Deco design principles, characterized by stylized illustrations, symmetry, and simplified forms. The waves, palm trees, and clouds are all reduced to essential geometric shapes with minimalistic lines, which are typical of Art Deco style. This contrasts sharply with photorealistic styles, which aim to closely replicate real-life appearances with detailed textures and shading.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ocean waves represented using bold, simplified geometric curves instead of naturalistic wave forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves are illustrated with pronounced curving lines and geometric shapes rather than the complex and detailed forms seen in natural waves. This use of bold, simplified geometric patterns is a hallmark of stylized graphic art, deviating from true-to-life representations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted as stylized vertical lines without detailed fronds or natural tree structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are portrayed as basic, vertical shapes with a few simple, sharp lines suggesting fronds, lacking the intricate detailing found in real palm trees. This stylized representation emphasizes form over fine detail, aligning with graphic and stylized design approaches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky rendered as symmetrical, geometric shapes rather than natural cloud forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clouds as symmetrical, rounded shapes with sharp, consistently curved edges, differing from the irregular and fluffy appearance of natural clouds. Such geometric representation is aligned with a stylized design approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use a color palette dominated by muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, avoiding bright or highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is composed of muted tones, with greens, blues, and warm oranges being prominent. These colors are less vibrant and highly saturated, a common trait in muted palette designs that aim for a more cohesive and gentle aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the essential elements of the beach scene—sand, ocean, horizon, and sky—still present and recognizable despite the stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Though stylized, Image B retains the essential components of a beach scene: the sand, ocean, horizon, and sky are clearly represented. Despite the abstraction and geometric stylization, these elements remain identifiable due to their positioning and contextual relationships within the image.",
