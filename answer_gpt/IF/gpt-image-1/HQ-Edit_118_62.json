      "question": "Is the pigeon rendered as a plush toy with soft, rounded features and a fabric-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pigeon is depicted with features that resemble those of a plush toy. The pigeon has soft, rounded features such as a plump body, oversized eyes, and a smooth, fabric-like texture that mimics materials typically used in plush toys. These characteristics suggest that the pigeon is indeed represented as a plush toy.",

      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a vibrant blue chest and gray wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pigeon is depicted with a distinct vibrant blue chest, which is a characteristic often used to add visual appeal to plush toys. The wings are gray, matching a neutral color palette that complements the bright blue chest. These specific colors suggest the careful design choices often employed in creating plush toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there subtle feather-like patterns visible on the surface of the plush pigeon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the pigeon does not show subtle feather-like patterns. Instead, the surface appears smooth and soft, consistent with the depiction of a plush toy rather than a realistic bird with textured feather patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the architectural structures in the background rendered as cookie-like forms with embossed or textured surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural structures in the background appear to be rendered with a texture reminiscent of cookie surfaces. The structures have an embossed or textured appearance, which is a detail commonly associated with decorative cookie designs. This texture gives the impression that the buildings are crafted from a material like molded cookie dough.",

      "question": "Is the plush pigeon positioned on a simple wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pigeon is positioned on an ornately designed architectural element. The detailed carvings and patterns on the surface do not resemble a simple wooden shelf, but instead suggest a more intricate and possibly sculpted material. Therefore, the setting does not resemble a simple wooden shelf.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the soft, plush texture of the pigeon and the hard, embossed texture of the cookie architecture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable visual contrast between the pigeon and the surrounding architecture. The pigeon has a smooth, plush texture, indicating its representation as a soft toy. In contrast, the architectural background has a hard, embossed texture with intricate details similar to cookie designs. This contrast highlights the differing textures between the pigeon and its environment.",
