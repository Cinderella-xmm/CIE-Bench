    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four separate images or prints shown, each featuring the fisherman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents four distinct scenes with the fisherman depicted in each. Each section is clearly divided, indicating that they are separate illustrations, possibly representing multiple versions or moments of the fisherman character.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the fisherman exhibit exaggerated proportions, simplified facial features, and bold outlines characteristic of semi-cartoon art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fisherman is illustrated with simplified anatomical features, such as large hands and a stylized plaid shirt, characteristic of a semi-cartoon style. This style often uses bold lines for definition and contrasts sharply with realistic art forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the texture of the fisherman's hat and plaid shirt visibly more detailed and pronounced compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures are more stylized and simplified due to its cartoonish art style, which contrasts with the detailed realism in Image A. This suggests less detail and more stylistic representation rather than an emphasis on intricate textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the fishing rod been replaced with a golden-colored wand-like object that resembles a magical staff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the fisherman holding a golden object rather than a traditional fishing rod. The shape and color are reminiscent of a wand or magical staff, which denotes a fantastical rather than realistic element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water below the fisherman's wand shows animated ripples with glowing elements, suggesting magical effects. These are characteristics often found in depictions of enchanted or mystical scenarios, diverging from natural water behavior.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frames around each illustration in Image B are visibly defined with consistent wood coloring and appear to have embossed patterns resembling pine trees. These frames are part of the artwork style but do not show specific signs of distress or weathering.",
