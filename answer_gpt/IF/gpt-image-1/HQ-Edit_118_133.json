    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle design, with the overall object now resembling a candle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object takes on features more consistent with candle design. The presence of a wick at the top indicates a candle-like function rather than a traditional teapot. Visual cues, such as the inclusion of a flame, further support this conclusion, clearly indicating a transformation from a teapot to a candle design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object now rendered with a transparent or translucent glass-like finish consistent with a candle base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is depicted with a glossy ceramic finish, not glass-like or translucent. This can be observed in the reflective quality and uniform color of the black material used, which is typical of enameled or ceramic objects rather than transparent candle bases.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the surface of the object exhibit a high-gloss ceramic finish instead of a metallic one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a high-gloss black ceramic-like surface. The shiny, smooth appearance of the surface is consistent with ceramic materials and contrasts with Image A's metallic finish, which typically shows more diffuse reflections and metal-like textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been replaced with a visible wick extending from the top of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traditional spout has not been retained, and instead, a wick extends from the top of the object, burning with a flame, signifying a candle modification. Unlike Image A, the presence of a flame at the top of the object emphasizes a candle-like design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a decorative gold accent rather than retaining its original functional form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the handle in a gold finish, which leans more towards an aesthetic accent rather than the more functional and sturdy wooden handle seen in Image A. Additionally, the color change and more ornate nature indicate a transformation from functional to decorative.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, subtle floral patterns can be observed at the base of the object, enhancing the decorative aspect of the design in line with its candle representation. These patterns are consistent with ornamental designs that add elegance to the object.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" written in elegant script on the front of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
