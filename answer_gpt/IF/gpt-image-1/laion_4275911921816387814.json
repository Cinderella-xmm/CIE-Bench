    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dagger now rendered as a soft, plush toy rather than a rigid weapon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an object with a soft and voluminous appearance, resembling a plushie or stuffed toy. The overall look lacks the sheen and hardness typical of metal or rigid materials. Its contours are rounded and smooth, commonly seen in plush toys. Comparing this with Image A, where the object is a rigid, metal-craft dagger, further confirms that Image B is indeed a plush toy version of the dagger.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blade made of soft, silver-gray fabric with black embroidered patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade appears to be made of fabric, as is typical for plush toys, displaying a soft texture with visible stitched black patterns that mimic embroidery. The silver-gray hue complements the embroidered designs. By contrast, Image A shows a blade with metal material and engraved designs, not fabric. The features confirm Image B has a fabric blade with embroidered patterns.",

      "question": "Is the hilt made of a soft, faux ivory-like fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a handle made of soft material, visually resembling fabric. The color is ivory-like, consistent with plush items aiming to mimic real materials. In Image A, the hilt is composed of rigid material, possibly ivory or a substitute, with a real metal guard. Image Bâ€™s soft material and coloration indicate a faux ivory-like fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all edges of the plush dagger, including the hilt and blade, appear rounded and smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual aspects in Image B show the plush dagger with distinctly rounded and smooth edges, which are characteristic of plush toys that need to be safe and cuddly by design. All contours, from the blade to the hilt, are smoothly sculpted without sharp angles or edges. Comparative analysis with Image A, where the dagger's edges are more defined and sharp due to its rigid metal composition, confirms the smoothness in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the plush dagger appear stuffed and voluminous, with softened contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides a view of a plush object whose contours are softened, rounded, and exhibit a voluminous appearance typical of stuffed items, giving it a pronounced 3D shape. In contrast, Image A presents the dagger as a slim, solid piece without any stuffing, reinforcing the assessment of Image B as a stuffed toy representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the plush dagger placed against a solid-colored backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the plush dagger against a backdrop of a single, solid color, which is a soft, neutral tone that helps highlight the object without distraction. Comparing it with Image A, where the dagger lies against a white cloth that is not completely solid due to folds and shadows, confirms that Image B uses a solid-colored background.",
