    "Question": "Q3: Does the composition of the edited image adhere to the golden ratio principles?",
    "explanation": "The golden ratio in composition refers to the arrangement of elements in a manner that is perceived as naturally harmonious and aesthetically pleasing. Image B has the girl positioned in such a way that her figure follows dynamic lines that might conform to the golden ratio, with her arms and legs extending into positions that create visual interest. However, without precise measurement using the golden spiral overlay, it's speculative. As a general assessment, the composition seems well-balanced but specific adherence to the golden ratio cannot be conclusively determined.",
