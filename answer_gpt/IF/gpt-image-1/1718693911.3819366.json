      "question": "Are bold, graphic lines used to delineate the outline and major features of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline and major features of the cat are drawn with bold, graphic lines, typical of a flat, illustrative style often seen in pop art or poster art. This approach simplifies shapes into distinct areas of color, separated by clear, thick lines, which aligns with the description.",

      "question": "Are the sunglasses depicted in a flat, vibrant orange color without gradients or shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunglasses in Image B appear to be in a flat, vibrant orange color. This is a stylistic choice in graphic art where colors are often used in their pure, saturated forms without gradients or shading to create a pop art effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beach background composed of simplified, abstract color blocks rather than realistic scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach background is represented by large, flat color blocks rather than realistic, detailed scenery. This approach abstracts the scene, reducing it to essential forms and colors, aligning with a minimalist art style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness and shadow under the cat are not depicted with gradient fills. Instead, they are shown using solid, flat colors typical of graphic illustrations, which reject the use of gradients or complex shading.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly uses red, blue, and yellow colors in a flat and high-contrast manner, characteristic of bold graphic designs. These primary colors are typically used to create strong visual impact in simplified art styles.",
