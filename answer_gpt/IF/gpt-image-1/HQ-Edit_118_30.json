      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the train cars depicted as large, colorful, interlocking blocks rather than realistic carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train cars are designed as cartoonish, colorful blocks interlocking with each other, resembling toy building blocks. This is visually distinct from realistic train carriages, which would typically have detailed windows, doors, and a streamlined structure. This block-like appearance is more abstract and playful, which is consistent with a non-realistic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the train rendered as swirling white forms instead of a realistic cloud of steam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke is depicted as stylized, swirling white shapes that are cartoon-like, rather than the irregular, wispy forms of actual steam. These exaggerated swirls symbolize smoke in a simplified and artistic manner, divorced from realistic texture and movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the countryside landscape been converted into various geometric patterns such as grids, polygons, or angular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countryside is transformed into a patchwork of geometric shapes including grids and polygons. This stylized approach simplifies natural contours into angular, colorful blocks, creating a mosaic-like effect that abstracts the real-world countryside into an aesthetic of geometric art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with small puzzle pieces showing individuals in vintage clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, human figures are seen as puzzle pieces set in specific areas of the scene. These represent individuals wearing vintage clothing similar to those in Image A. The conversion of complete figures into pieces adds a whimsical, puzzle-like quality to the scene, indicating a deliberate artistic abstraction.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire puzzle scene placed on a light-colored wooden tabletop with visible grain and edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the puzzle scene assembled on a wooden background. The wood is light-colored, with visible grain and distinct edges, giving the appearance of a table surface. This provides a physical context for the puzzle, enhancing the sense of an assembled, tactile object through the use of visible, natural textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible interlocking edges, seams, or puzzle-piece borders throughout the scene indicating a complex, assembled structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is segmented into pieces with visible edges, seams, and borders characteristic of puzzle pieces. These features are purposely included to simulate a jigsaw puzzle structure, emphasizing the assembled nature of the entire image.",
