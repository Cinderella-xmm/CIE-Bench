      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the warrior statue composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with visible brick-like elements forming its body, limbs, and head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior statue is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks. The individual rectangular and square brick elements are visible, contributing to the overall blocky appearance of the statue. This is consistent with the construction methods for typical LEGO models, where visible seams and brick shapes are prominent.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the primary colors used in the statue limited to shades of brown and tan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the statue using a monochromatic color scheme primarily consisting of shades of brown and tan. This can be observed in the representation of different parts of the statue, such as the body, limbs, and accessories, all created using these hues.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armor sections (such as chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards) made of smooth LEGO bricks without surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor sections of the statue appear to be made of LEGO bricks that are smooth and do not exhibit any intricate surface textures or patterns. This characteristic is typical of LEGO constructions, where brick surfaces are relatively smooth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental details such as the headdress, necklace, and carvings on the torso created using textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details of the statue, such as the headdress and necklace, do not display any textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns. Instead, they appear to be part of the smooth brick construction typical of LEGO models, with detailing achieved through shape rather than texture.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO statue positioned on a plain white pedestal with no decorative elements, located in a gallery environment with framed artworks on the walls and track lighting overhead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO statue placed on a simple, flat white pedestal without any decorative features. The environment around the statue includes framed artwork on the walls and overhead track lighting, indicating a gallery setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO statue retain the same standing posture, facial expression, and proportional dimensions as the original wooden warrior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B with Image A, the LEGO statue in Image B maintains the same standing posture and proportional dimensions as the original wooden warrior statue. However, due to the nature of the medium, the facial expression is not directly comparable in detailed features as LEGO constructions rely more on form than detailed carving.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the statue visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, with no continuous surfaces resembling carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is indeed constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, as indicated by the visible seams and distinct brick formations throughout its structure. There are no continuous surfaces that mimic the appearance of carved wood, which would normally be seen in a sculpture made from traditional materials like wood.",
