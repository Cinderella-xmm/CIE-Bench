        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two birds that appear as model figures, with distinct features typical of anime-style representations. They have slightly exaggerated and stylized traits, such as the large, rounded eyes and smooth, well-defined color transitions which resemble the characteristics of anime models rather than real birds. Thus, the conclusion is drawn from the visual distinction between realistic and anime-style characteristics.",
