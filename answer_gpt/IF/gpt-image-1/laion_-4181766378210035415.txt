    "Question": "Q1: Is the bed fully constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, including the frame, mattress, and base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bed appears to be entirely constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks. The frame, mattress, and pillows all exhibit a blocky, modular appearance typical of LEGO construction. The uniformity of the rectangular segments and the visible lines between them provide clear evidence of assembly from LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are white and light blue LEGO bricks used to recreate the botanical pattern visible on the original bedding?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding shows a botanical pattern that is very similar to the one in Image A, however, instead of LEGO bricks, it appears to be printed or textured directly onto the surface of brick elements. The pattern is created by a printed design rather than the use of different colored LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the headboard been replaced with smooth, curved LEGO pieces to create a rounded shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the headboard does not feature smooth, curved pieces; instead, it retains a blocky, angular design consistent with that of regular LEGO bricks. The brick style does not exhibit any curvature that differentiates from the standard rectangular blocks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the pillows made from stacked smaller LEGO bricks, giving them a distinct three-dimensional structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows are formed using layers of smaller LEGO bricks. This layering gives them a three-dimensional structure which mimics the appearance of stacked pillows. The visual cue of distinct layers indicates the use of smaller bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background of the edited image the same grayscale as the original image?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to have a similar grayscale quality to that of Image A. Both images offer a simple, muted backdrop that highlights the bed, allowing for direct comparison of foreground elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the LEGO bed appear playful due to visible brick construction and structured due to orderly arrangement and clear modular design?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO bed in Image B clearly showcases its LEGO construction, with visible brick lines and structure. The inherent orderly arrangement and modularity of LEGO blocks impart a structured design, while the recognizable LEGO aesthetic adds an element of playfulness, achieved through its distinctive style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
