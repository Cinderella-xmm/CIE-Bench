      "question": "Are the weightlifter's arms significantly larger and more exaggerated in proportion compared to a realistic human figure, consistent with cartoon styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the weightlifter is depicted in a cartoon style, characterized by exaggerated and oversized body features. The arms are particularly large in comparison to the rest of the body, which is a common trait in cartoon designs to emphasize strength and muscle mass. This contrasts with realistic human proportions. Such stylization is consistent with cartoon character designs, where certain features are intentionally exaggerated for stylistic or thematic purposes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the weightlifter wearing a tank top with graphics of barbells, kettlebells, and other symbolic representations related to fitness and bodybuilding. This design choice reinforces the gym theme by visually linking the character's attire with common gym motifs, enhancing the overall theme of strength and exercise.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the mirror display abstract or creative shadow illustrations rather than a realistic depiction of the weightlifter and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there isn't a mirror reflection showing a creative or abstract representation. Instead, the image focuses on a singular stylized character and illustrations of gym-related symbols. The concept of mirror reflections in this context doesn't apply as there are no mirrors depicted with reflections in this image. ",

      "question": "Have the black weight plates on the barbell been replaced with colorful, stylized icons (e.g., stars, dumbbells, flames, etc.)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the weight plates on the barbell are represented with bold, red and orange colors that stand out more than the traditional black weight plates seen in most gym equipment. While they do not feature specific icons like stars or flames, the color choice itself adds stylization, fitting the cartoonish and symbol-laden theme of the overall illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal strip at the bottom of the image that resembles a calendar layout (with numbers, days, or month labels) and appears detachable (e.g., with perforated edges or a tab)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the edited image (Image B), there is a horizontal strip resembling a calendar layout, complete with days and numeral dates for a month labeled 'April'. The style suggests it might be part of a page from a calendar. This element incorporates into the image a typical design of detachable calendar pages, supporting the theme of a calendar layout.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image (Image B) is indeed designed to look like a wooden panel. The texture and color scheme of the background suggest a light wood grain, which appears natural and gives a distinct contrast to the vibrant character illustration in the foreground. This design choice provides a calming and neutral backdrop for the bold colors of the character and symbols.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) maintains the similar standing posture of the weightlifter as seen in Image A. The character is facing slightly to the viewer's right while holding the barbell near the waist level.
