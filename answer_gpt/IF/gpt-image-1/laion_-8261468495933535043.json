      "question": "Are the sausages, salad, and egg completely replaced by glass tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire composition, including the sausages, salad, and egg, is composed of small, colored tiles that construct a mosaic pattern, replacing the original food items with a tile representation. This transformation from food to decorative tile art indicates that the food items have been completely replaced by glass tiles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiles that form the shapes representing the sausages are predominantly in warm shades, reminiscent of terracotta colors. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the warm tones are indeed terracotta-like.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic in Image B depicts the salad portion with tiles in various shades of green, closely resembling the natural variations of leafy greens. This indicates that the salad is constructed with tiles in leafy green colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The egg-shaped area in Image B features tiles in bright yellow tones, especially for the yolk, which is commonly associated with a sunny disposition. Tiles surrounding the yolk area form circles, further enhancing the look of roundness.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the tiles for the sausages do not appear significantly larger than those used for forming the lettuce. The sizes of the tiles throughout the mosaic are relatively uniform, focusing more on color to delineate items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic in Image B, while artistically composed, does not display symmetry around a central axis; it reflects a design influenced by natural food arrangement rather than symmetry. Additionally, the background appears as part of the plate and is not distinctly plain, suggesting a realistic setting rather than an abstract one.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by the use of vibrantly colored tiles to represent different food elements in an artistic mosaic format. The combination of colors and careful arrangement of tiles produces an aesthetically pleasing and cohesive art piece, indicative of a well-crafted mosaic design.",
