    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the carrot now growing inside a space greenhouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is placed in an environment that resembles a futuristic, metallic, enclosed chamber, which is associated with a space greenhouse setting. The walls and lighting suggest an advanced cultivation station that could exist in space, characterized by high-tech features and a controlled atmosphere typically seen in space or sci-fi scenarios.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include a metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber surrounding the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a clearly defined metallic structure surrounding the carrot. This structure includes embedded lighting and a design typical of climate control and technological environments, often used for maintaining specific growing conditions in cultivation chambers.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carrot now rooted in synthetic substrate instead of natural soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The substrate in Image B appears homogeneous and uniformly textured, indicative of an artificial or synthetic material. This differs from natural soil which has varied textures and organic components, suggesting synthetic substrate use.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the carrot appear visibly rooted in the synthetic substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the carrot firmly placed within the substrate, showing visual cues of being embedded or rooted within this material, consistent with an intact rooting scenario within the synthetic substrate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has all evidence of the original outdoor garden environment been removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a completely different setting from Image A. The original garden soil is replaced by synthetic substrate, and the outdoor garden environment is replaced by an enclosed metallic chamber, removing all traces of the outdoor setting.",
