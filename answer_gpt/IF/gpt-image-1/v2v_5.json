      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a stylized 3D chibi form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a zebra that appears cartoonish with exaggerated features, typical of the chibi style, including large eyes and a playful demeanor. The 3D rendering of the zebra further supports this assessment. Chibi style often involves a cute and compact representation, which matches the appearance of the zebra in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the zebra’s stripes and distinctive pattern accurately depicted as in the original photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are more stylized and simplified compared to a real zebra's complex stripe pattern, focusing on cuteness and simplicity typical of a cartoonish representation. Image A shows a real zebra with natural, realistic stripes, while Image B prioritizes artistic representation over accuracy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake in Image B appears to be similar in design to the one in Image A, characterized by a zebra-striped cake with a candle. The zebra in Image B is in a playful pose, suggesting an engagement with the cake. The petite scale of the item compared to the oversized look of the chibi zebra adds to the playful interaction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is indeed leaning forward with a curious expression, and is depicted as being inside an Instagram frame that has been creatively enlarged as a 3D object. This frame serves as both a background and a part of the environment, which indicates the crafted, stylized setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, prominent visual information inside the Instagram frame includes the username “ZebraLover” near the top. This placement is consistent with where usernames appear on social media frames, fulfilling the typical layout of Instagram headers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible social media-related icons, such as hearts and speech bubbles, which resemble 'like' and 'comment' indicators typically associated with social media posts. However, traditional free-floating 'share' icons are not prominently visible, as they are not floating separately but integrated into the frame.",
