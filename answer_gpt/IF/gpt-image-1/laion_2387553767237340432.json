      "question": "Does the edited image include a visible brand name \"Earth Elegance\" on the packaging or product?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the words 'Earth Elegance' are clearly visible on both the vases and the packaging. The text is prominently displayed in a gold color against the marbled vases, as well as on the black packaging. This indicates that there is a clear and deliberate branding effort present in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the texture of the vases been changed from clay to a marbled ceramic finish with visible veining and smooth surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vases appear to have a marbled ceramic finish, distinguished by their smooth surface and visible marbling veins. This contrasts with the original clay texture in Image A, which lacks this marbling and has a more matte and earthy finish. The visual cues in Image B, such as the glossy shine and intricate veining, reflect a change in material texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B features branding decals of 'Earth Elegance' on both the vases and the packaging.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gold leaf accents are prominently visible along the rim and petal edges of the vases. This gilded detailing is enhanced by the contrast with the marbled surface, giving the vases a distinguished and luxurious appearance, which is visually apparent through the reflective golden lines.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows packaging that includes an illustration resembling the external pattern of the vases, but it does not provide a cross-sectional view of the interior. The illustration focuses on featuring the outer design rather than an interior view.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B is a matte black box, and it features typography in a bronze color. This color combination is clearly observed in the image, which fits common packaging design strategies aimed at conveying elegance and luxury to the consumer.",
