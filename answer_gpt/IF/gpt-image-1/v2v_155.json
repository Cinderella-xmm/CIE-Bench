      "question": "Is the golden car depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden car is styled with exaggerated round shapes, larger windows, and a cartoon-like appearance, characteristic of the chibi style. Chibi refers to a style that portrays figures with exaggerated features usually for a cute effect, such as larger and rounder proportions. Observing the rounded shape and playful design characterizes the car in Image B as 3D chibi style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car look like it is emerging from the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car appears partially outside of the boundaries of a white frame, suggesting it is protruding from the frame. The visual illusion here — inspired by common 3D art techniques — creates the perception of the car extending beyond the flat image plane, indicating an 'emerging' effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a human hand visible, grasping the edges of the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, human hands are visibly holding the edges of the frame on both sides. The fingers wrapped around the frame clearly suggest someone is grasping the object, which is confirmed by the visibility of skin tone and familiar hand positioning that would naturally be interpreted as grasping.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the car retained its golden color in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B maintains its golden color, as evidenced by its consistent hue and shine throughout the body regardless of the transformation in style. The edited image presents a car that, although stylistically altered, still exhibits the rich golden color identifiable from typical observations of color retention.",

      "question": "Is the transition from a flat 2D space to a 3D reality clearly depicted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation transitions from what would typically be contained within a flat frame to the car protruding from the frame, becoming part of a 3D reality. This is exemplified by the spatial composition, where elements such as the car and toothbrush's positioning relative to the frame enhance the perception of depth and transformative dimensional changes.",
