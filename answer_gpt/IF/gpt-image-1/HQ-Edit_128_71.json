        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the Statue of Liberty display both verdigris (greenish-blue) and copper-hued (reddish-brown) patinas on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "explanation": "In Image B, the Statue of Liberty is painted with a greenish-blue color typical for the statue's verdigris patina, but there is no evidence of a copper-hued layer on its surface. The lantern is bronze-colored, but the statue itself lacks these colors. Therefore, the statue displays only verdigris patina.",
