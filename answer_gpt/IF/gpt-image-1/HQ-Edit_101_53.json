    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a pug whose surface is textured to resemble wood grain rather than fur. The appearance and materials imply it is a sculpture rather than a living dog, as living dogs have fur and different textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the fur been replaced with smooth, polished wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a smooth surface with visible wood grain that is typical of polished wood rather than the fibrous and soft texture of fur seen in living animals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pug sculpture in a deep brown tone consistent with walnut wood. This color is darker than the natural color of a pug's fur, but is commonly associated with walnut wood, shifting from the original pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features like wrinkles are depicted as carved lines, which are typical of wooden sculptures. This contrasts with Image A where the pug's features are softer and natural, suggesting skin folds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden pug placed on a simple black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a black base directly beneath the wooden pug sculpture. This base is simple and serves to display the sculpture, which is common for such art pieces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the black base provide a stark contrast to the rich wood texture of the sculpture, emphasizing its craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The contrast between the dark black base and the rich brown wood tones in Image B does emphasize the sculpture's craftsmanship, as the varied tones highlight the intricacy and smoothness of the wooden surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
