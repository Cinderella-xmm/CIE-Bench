      "question": "Does the entire image show characteristics of Ukiyo-e style, with flat colors and clear lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the image shows characteristics of the Ukiyo-e style with flat colors and clear, defined lines. This style is recognized by its simplistic yet expressive representation with distinct outlines and uniform fields of color. The grass and baseball bats in the image are presented with uniform color areas and pronounced outlines, aligning with the traditional Ukiyo-e art approach.",

      "question": "Are there visible traditional Japanese painting brush strokes on the baseball bat and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the appearance of the baseball bats and grass are rendered in a smooth, flat style typical of Ukiyo-e woodblock prints, which often do not show individual brush strokes but instead have a polished, carved look. Traditional Japanese painting brush strokes would typically be more visible and textured, which is not the case here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the shapes of the baseball bats and grass been maintained while adapting to the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the essential shapes of the baseball bats and grass are retained, with attention paid to outline and form adaptation to the Ukiyo-e style. The bats remain cylindrical with rounded ends, and the depiction of grass retains its natural growth pattern, both adjusted for stylistic integrity with clear outlines and flat color regions.",

      "question": "Has the grass been rendered with traditional Japanese brush strokes to reflect the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B is depicted with smooth, continuous outlines and flat areas of color typical of the Ukiyo-e style. Traditional Japanese brush strokes would imply more texture and visible stroke lines, which are not present here. Instead, the grass adheres to the Ukiyo-e aesthetic, focusing on flatness over texture.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the baseball bat display traditional Japanese brush strokes, adhering to the Ukiyo-e style requirements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball bats are characterized by outlined shapes and even color tones, consistent with Ukiyo-e style, which typically does not showcase individual brush strokes. The style requirement of Ukiyo-e is met through its simplified, clean visual without the explicit presence of brush strokes, focusing more on the overall graphical and flat aesthetic typical of woodblock prints.",
