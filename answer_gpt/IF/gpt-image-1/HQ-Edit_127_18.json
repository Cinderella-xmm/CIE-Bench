    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire elephant and savannah scene enclosed within a visible vintage travel case structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant along with the landscape is clearly positioned inside a leather case, which has a visible handle and latches typical of a vintage travel case. This visual setup creates an enclosed diorama-like appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant and landscape elements appear as detailed miniature 3D models with realistic scaling and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant, tree, and other elements are arranged in a small, enclosed space, suggesting a reduced scale typical of miniature dioramas. The proportions and details give an impression of reduced size yet retain realistic depth, indicating they are indeed miniature 3D representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ground covered with a material that resembles grass but has a textured, resin-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B mimics a grassy surface, yet it has a texture that looks as if it is crafted from a synthetic or sculpted substance, resembling resin. This gives the floor a structured, durable look while trying to imitate natural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small-scale acacia tree placed in the diorama to indicate scale balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small tree is present next to the elephant, which balances the scene's scale similar to a real acacia tree in the savannah. Its placement and small size relative to the elephant showcase the scale variation within the diorama.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky depicted as painted elements on the inner surface of a backdrop lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B, set behind the miniature scene, has a two-dimensional look consistent with a painting or print on the lid of the case. The positioning and style suggest they are decorative elements applied to the background surface rather than physical or separate clouds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a brass-colored compass placed on the base of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, next to the elephant and the acacia tree, a circular object resembling a compass is visible. Its golden hue suggests a brass-like material typical in classical compasses, indicating a thematic addition to complement the diorama.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
