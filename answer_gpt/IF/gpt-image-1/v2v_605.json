      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted in a Funko Pop-style box with an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box containing the gorilla figure has design elements that resemble those of Funko Pop-style boxes, such as the presentation of the figure in an isometric perspective inside a rectangular window on the packaging. This perspective allows a partial view of the figure's body and accessories, which is consistent with Funko Pop packaging. Based on these visual cues and common presentation styles, the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The images depict a gorilla figure within a box, and the box clearly displays the text 'JUNGLE KING' at the top of the packaging. This prominent placement is typical for such collectorâ€™s items to indicate the product name or theme. Thus, using these visual indicators and typical box design conventions, the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style figures are characterized by exaggerated features, such as large heads and small bodies, which are visible in the gorilla figure inside the box in Image B. The figure displays these typical attributes of the chibi art style, which are designed to be cute and stylized. Given these stylistic details, the analysis concludes that the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla figure is adorned with a leafy crown and is holding a wooden staff. The box and figure present jungle-themed details that support this observation, aligning with the aesthetic implied in the title 'Jungle King.' These elements are part of the figure's portrayal, thus the answer is yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks a realistic illustration of the gorilla outside the box with detailed textures and lighting. The figure depicted outside the box is the same chibi-style figure shown inside, maintaining the cartoonish aesthetic without realistic textures or advanced lighting attributes. Based on these observations, the answer is no.",
