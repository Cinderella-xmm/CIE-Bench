      "question": "Is the central figure in the edited image now a robot horse rather than a biological horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the central figure is clearly designed as a robot, characterized by its mechanical structure composed of clearly visible articulated joints and a metallic appearance, which are iconic features identifying it as a robot rather than a biological animal. This conclusion stems from a visual assessment combined with world knowledge about the typical appearance of robots in media and art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image maintain the same posture as the original horse, with its head lowered as if grazing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biomechanical horse is depicted with its head lowered toward the ground, suggesting a grazing posture. When comparing this to the original image (Image A), where the animal is also in a head-lowered position, we observe a similar posture. World knowledge about a horse's typical grazing posture aids in confirming this analysis.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have a silver-white metallic shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the biomechanical horse is presented with a shiny metallic exterior that is silver-white in color, which is a common depiction for robotic or mechanical constructs. This assessment is based on analyzing the visual cue of its polished metallic surface combined with common knowledge of how metals like chrome or stainless steel appear.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exposed joint mechanisms visible on the biomechanical horse in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly illustrates a mechanical horse with notable features such as distinct joints that are articulated and appear as separate parts exposed in the design. Such details are typical in representations of robotic creatures where their joint mechanisms are purposely highlighted to emphasize their mechanical nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have glowing red sensor eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The biomechanical horse in Image B features an eye-like structure on its head that emits a red glow, which can be recognized as a sensor eye due to its intensity and suggestive function commonly ascribed to such features in robotic designs. The judicious use of red light as a sensor or indicator in mechanics and robotics is a known design choice within the realm of technology.",
