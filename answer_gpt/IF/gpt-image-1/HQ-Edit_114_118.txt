    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears to be encapsulated within a glass dome, evident from the curved transparent boundary surrounding the miniature ship, sky, and ocean representation. This is a common feature in dioramas or models displayed under domed glass, providing a visually distinct enclosure to protect and enhance the miniature scene inside.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sails of the ship exhibit characteristics typical of papercraft, such as visible creases, layered construction, and shadows that suggest a three-dimensional quality achieved through cut and folded paper. This analysis is based on observing the texture and the way light interacts with the material in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a blue base beneath the ship that is consistent with translucent resin. The texture appears to capture light and create a shimmering effect, mimicking the appearance of real ocean waves. This is characteristic of how resin can be used in dioramas to simulate water surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, seagulls appear to be hovering in the air around the ship. This suspended appearance could suggest they are held by fine wires, commonly used in model displays to create an illusion of flight, giving the birds a static yet dynamic presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "Image B maintains the same general structure of the ship as in Image A, including the masts, rigging, and hull design. However, these elements are scaled down to fit within the diorama setting under the glass dome, preserving the recognition of the ship's details in a miniature format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the resin layer beneath the ship visibly exhibits surface textures and reflections typical of water, capturing light shimmers that mimic the illusion of flowing ocean waves, which is consistent with how resin is manipulated to simulate water surfaces in art and dioramas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the curved glass dome visibly present with clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a glass dome is evident with its clear, curved boundaries visible around the scene. There are also subtle light distortions and refractions indicative of light passing through curved glass, enhancing the perception of an enclosed diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"
