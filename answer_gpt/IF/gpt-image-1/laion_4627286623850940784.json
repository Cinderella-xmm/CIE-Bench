      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout is structured with a central figure (the gnome), surrounded by text and decorative elements, resembling the design found on product packaging.

      "question": "Has the woven basket been replaced with a seed packet display that resembles a typical seed packet (e.g., flat, labeled, rectangular)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image A shows the gnome holding a woven basket with flowers, while Image B depicts a box labeled 'Seed Packet' next to round objects in the gnome's hands. Although it is a box and not a traditional seed packet shape, the presence of the label 'Seed Packet' indicates a shift from a woven basket to a packaging display related to seeds.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of flowers, the gnome holds round, textured objects which visually and conceptually resemble seed bombs, aligning with the theme of 'Seed Kit' and garden planting. This is a change from the more vibrant and flower-like objects in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features decorative elements that resemble botanical illustrations, such as leaf and plant designs around the gnome. Additionally, there is a ground-like base that suggests soil texture, adapting the theme of gardening and plants present in the design.",
