      "question": "Is the perfume bottle constructed entirely out of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is constructed using Lego bricks, evident from the geometric and pixelated appearance typical of Lego constructions. The bottle replicates the faceted design as seen in Image A, but the details are represented with Lego pieces instead of glass and metal. This construction method is unique to Lego, supporting the conclusion that the bottle in Image B is entirely composed of Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Is the fabric background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background made of Lego bricks, which mimics the undulating and textured appearance of fabric from Image A. By observing the texture and pattern typical of interlocking Lego pieces across Image B, it is clear that the fabric background is recreated using Lego bricks. The layered construction of Lego simulates the waves and folds of fabric effectively.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and positioning of the perfume bottle and fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features a perfume bottle on a draped fabric background, positioned centrally with a spray effect heading to the right. Image B mirrors this composition, with the Lego bottle centrally placed and spray directed similarly, maintaining both position and orientation consistent with the original layout. The diorama approach keeps the arrangement unchanged, even as materials differ.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the perfume bottle, including the cap and spray mechanism, accurately represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The details of the perfume bottle in Image B are represented with Lego bricks including the cap with its polygonal shape and the mechanism that emits the spray. While the Lego bricks restrict detailing compared to real materials in Image A, they successfully capture the overall design and structure accurately, resembling the spray mechanism and cap shape found in the original.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stop-motion diorama style consistently applied to both the perfume bottle and the fabric background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The diorama style in Image B is shown through the use of Lego bricks both for the perfume bottle and the background, simulating the original materials' textures and forms with consistent Lego styling. The approach gives both elements a cohesive and integrated look, maintaining the stop-motion diorama theme throughout the image.",
