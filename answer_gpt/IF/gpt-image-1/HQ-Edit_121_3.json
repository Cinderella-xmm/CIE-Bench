      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the butterfly been transformed into a creature that visually resembles a floral being, with no recognizable insectoid body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature resembles a floral being as there are no recognizable insectoid parts; the wings are petal-like, reminiscent of flower petals, and the body resembles a flower stalk. The transformation effectively eliminates any insect-like characteristics, creating an entity fully integrated with the floral environment. This conclusion comes from the visual absence of insect anatomy and the presence of floral elements, supporting the reasoning that the butterfly has been turned into a flower-like creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings appear folded into distinct, vibrant petal-like structures instead of flat, membranous insect wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are folded and crafted to appear as vibrant petals rather than flat and membranous insect wings. The visual cues show layered petal structures that mimic the vivid color and texture of actual flower petals, indicating a shift from insect wings to plant-like structures. This transformation is evident from the detailed petal patterns and vibrant colors, suggesting the wings have been transformed into flower petals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the butterfly's body now resemble a thin, upright flower stalk rather than an insectâ€™s segmented torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the creature is no longer a segmented insect torso but has been artistically transformed into what appears to be a thin, upright flower stalk. This interpretation stems from the visual structure and alignment of the body, which aligns with floral elements and diverges from typical insect anatomy. The presence of stalk-like features suggests a transformation towards floral characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original wing patterns replaced with detailed, naturalistic leaf designs across the entire surface of the wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wings adorned with detailed leaf-like patterns rather than the typical butterfly wing patterns. The naturalistic design of leaves covers the wings, replacing the usual insect wing designs. The leaf patterning is clearly visible and distinct, using detailed texturing that suggests a deliberate change from insect to plant motifs, confirming a transformation into naturalistic leaf designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible tendril-like structures extending from the tips of the butterfly's antennae?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features tendril-like structures extending from the antennae tips. These structures resemble botanical tendrils, further enhancing the floral motif. The presence of these visually distinct tendril shapes confirms the transformation from insect antennae to plant-like extensions, recognizable by their curling and organic appearance, indicating a botanical transformation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small blossoms visibly attached to the edges of the wings and at the foot/lowest part of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small blossoms are attached to the edges of the wings and the lower part of the creature. The visual cues of floral elements are clearly integrated into the wing design, including blossoms, supporting the conclusion that these elements are deliberately placed to enhance the floral aesthetic. This attachment of blossoms further suggests the fusion of insectoid aspects with floral imagery.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background identical to the original image, featuring the same meadow with pink coneflowers, golden grasses, and blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B retains the general theme of a meadow setting with coneflowers, grasses, and a blue sky, it does not appear identical to Image A. Changes in specific designs and placements indicate variance in the image background. The alterations in subtle background details such as flower and grass positioning indicate it's not identical but similarly themed.",
