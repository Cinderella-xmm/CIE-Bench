      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's dress appears to transform into flowing petal-like structures. This is evident as the lower part of the dress consists of petal-like extensions that mimic the shape and flow of flowers. This design aligns with a more illustrative and fantasy style, suggesting a transformation from the original dress. World knowledge informs us that such petal motifs are often used to create a fairy-tale or nature-inspired look in illustrations.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moonlit area designed as a writing space is bordered by soft cloud shapes.
