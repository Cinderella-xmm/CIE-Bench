        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that the lighting is dominated by strong blue and purple neon hues, which are commonly associated with the cyberpunk genre. The use of such lighting, combined with the high contrast and focus on technology (like the laptop), reflects a futuristic aesthetic typical of cyberpunk. This analysis is based on the association of these color schemes and themes with cyberpunk in popular media and design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keyboard in Image B is bathed in blue and purple neon light, which is evident from the glowing key edges and the overall hue of the lighting reflecting off the keys.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the fingers are illuminated with a bluish-purple tint, giving an impression of them glowing softly.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire Image B is awash with blue and purple tones that are characteristic of cyberpunk visuals. This consistent lighting harmonizes with the glowing keyboard and fingertips, creating a unified scene typical for this style. The thoughtful use of these colors to highlight elements and create ambiance confirms the cyberpunk influence.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consistently uses cyberpunk-like lighting and visual themes across the entire visible area. The keyboard, the hands resting on it, and the background are all under the influence of the blue-purple neon lights, without any elements breaking the theme or adding discordant features that wouldn't fit within a cyberpunk aesthetic.",
