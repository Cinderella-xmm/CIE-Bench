      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle that appears to be constructed entirely from LEGO bricks. Each part, including the body, cap, and label, displays the classic LEGO brick texture and structure with interlocking knobs. This indicates that no realistic glass or plastic elements are present in the design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a bottle with pronounced sculptural features, including defined edges and 3D form. The use of LEGO bricks inherently creates a depth and texture, emphasizing the model's intricate construction.",
