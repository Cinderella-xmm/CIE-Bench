      "question": "Is the vase now composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics the original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is clearly made of a transparent material with faceted details that resemble a crystal vase. The intricate facets and transparency are characteristics of crystal, changing the appearance from the ceramic vase in Image A. Based on this visual information and the properties of crystal, it can be inferred that the material is indeed crystal and mimics the overall shape of the original vase.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the vase no longer has the painted figures or scenes visible in Image A. Instead, the surface of the vase in Image B displays etched patterns that seem to represent abstract floral designs, consistent with common decorative techniques used in crystal work. This replacement indicates a shift from painted to etched patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers appear to be rendered in a translucent material, possibly crystal, and they exhibit soft pastel colors. They maintain the shape of flowers but are clearly not organic due to the material's characteristics. This distinct change, in contrast to the natural flowers seen in Image A, shows that the flowers in Image B are indeed crystal-like.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the vase on what appears to be a flat, reflective surface that acts like a mirror, reflecting the vase and flowers. This minimalistic setting contrasts with the ornate table of Image A and aligns with the description of a mirrored pedestal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the same overall shape, size, and structural features (such as handles and foot) as the original ornate vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a vase with a similar structural shape, handles, and foot as seen in Image A, despite the change in material to crystal. It maintains the overall design and structure, indicating that these features have been preserved in the transformation from ceramic to crystal, supporting continuity in the vase's form.",
