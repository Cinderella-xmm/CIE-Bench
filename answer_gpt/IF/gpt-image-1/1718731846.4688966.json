      "question": "Does the figurine appear to be made of polished wood, with visible wood grain and a smooth, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the figurine displays characteristics typical of polished wood, such as a visible wood grain pattern that runs through the surface and a smooth, reflective finish that suggests a polished wood material. By observing the texture and sheen of the surface, it is reasonable to determine that the figurine is depicted as made of polished wood.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black and white areas of the dog's fur represented using contrasting natural wood tones (dark vs. light)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine using two contrasting wood tones to represent different fur areas. The distinct darker and lighter wood tones appear on the halves of the face analogous to black and white fur, showcasing the use of natural wood colors to provide contrast. This suggests that the figurine deliberately uses natural wood tones for the effect.",

      "question": "Do the figurineâ€™s contours appear smooth and rounded, avoiding sharp or angular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's contours are smooth and rounded. The edges are softened, reflecting a crafting style that prioritizes gentle curves over sharp or angular lines. This is evident in the overall shape of the figurine, including features like the ears, legs, and body, which are devoid of sharp angles, emphasizing a rounded design.",

      "question": "Are facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth enhanced with visible fine carved lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the facial features are portrayed with smooth surfaces rather than fine carved lines. The eyes are notably rounded and smooth, and the nose and mouth maintain a polished look typical of fine woodworking without intricate lines. This suggests that the design is simplistic and smooth rather than detailed with carved lines.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the figurine sitting on a simple wooden platform. The style and material of this platform are consistent with the figurine, as both share similar wood textures and tones, creating a cohesive look. The platform is minimalistic, enhancing the focus on the figurine and complementing its design.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image emphasize craftsmanship through natural wood textures, subtle lighting, and a muted color palette compared to the original bright appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses an emphasis on craftsmanship by showcasing natural wood textures and subtle lighting. The muted color palette, synonymous with fine woodworking, highlights the quality and detail of the wood grain without the brightness associated with Image A. This choice in lighting and color palette accentuates the artisanal quality of the figurine.",
