    "Question": "Q1: Are the weightlifter's arms significantly larger and more exaggerated in proportion compared to a realistic human figure, consistent with cartoon styling?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the weightlifter is depicted in a cartoon style, characterized by exaggerated and oversized body features. The arms are particularly large in comparison to the rest of the body, which is a common trait in cartoon designs to emphasize strength and muscle mass.

    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the weight plates on the barbell are represented with bold, red and orange colors that stand out more than the traditional black weight plates seen in most gym equipment.
