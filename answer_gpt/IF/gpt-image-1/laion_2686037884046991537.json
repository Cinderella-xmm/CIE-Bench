      "question": "Is the image formatted as a two-panel comic with the title \"The Whoopie Pie Chronicles\" displayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, it is clear from the visual layout that it consists of two distinct panels depicting a scene with comic characters. However, there is no indication of a title 'The Whoopie Pie Chronicles' visible anywhere in the image. Therefore, acknowledging comic panel structure without an observable title leads to concluding that the title is not displayed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
