      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear exhibits a clear plush toy texture, characterized by a soft, furry appearance typical of stuffed toys. This material choice gives the bear a warm and cuddly look that contrasts with any illustrated design that might lack texture detail, which often appears flat and less tactile. The texture of a plush toy is usually highlighted by lighting effects that emphasize the plushness. Combining these visual cues with common knowledge about how plush toys look, it's clear this bear is designed with a plush toy texture.",
