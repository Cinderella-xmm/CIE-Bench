    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Blue Jay rendered as a miniature sculpture made of a solid material such as ceramic or metal, rather than a live bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Blue Jay is depicted with smooth surfaces, vivid colors, and stylized features, lacking intricate details typical of a real bird, which are indicative of a crafted object made from a solid material like ceramic. The absence of movement and the uniformity of the texture further suggest it is a model rather than a live bird.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Blue Jay sculpture is clearly situated inside a transparent, bell-shaped glass dome, which is indicated by the reflections and the curvature of the dome surrounding the sculpture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Blue Jay is perched on a small branch, and there are stylized green ivy leaves attached to the branch. Although the wood itself is slightly stylized, the presence of leaves suggests the idea of ivy growing on the perch.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
