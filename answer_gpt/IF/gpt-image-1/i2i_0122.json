        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes visual cues like sunlight casting a warm glow over snowy terrain and steam rising from the drinks, evoking a cozy winter setting. These elements, combined with the snow and sunlight interplay, contribute to a warm winter atmosphere.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B features entirely different background elements, such as the snowy cabin and outdoor setting, which replace the indoor scene with blurred windows seen in Image A. This suggests that no elements from the original background remain.",
