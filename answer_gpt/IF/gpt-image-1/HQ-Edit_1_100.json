    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible calendar layout element (such as a date, month, or decorative border) indicating the image is formatted as an art calendar page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presentation includes the word 'March' and a sequence of numbered days beneath the image, which clearly indicates a calendar format. Decorative elements such as borders contribute to the typical art calendar appearance. These elements are absent in Image A.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure exhibit characteristics of a half-cartoon style, such as stylized facial features, smooth lines, or exaggerated proportions while maintaining realism in other areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is rendered with smooth lines, simplified features, and exaggerated proportions, typical of a stylized cartoon style. The transition from realism in Image A to the stylized approach in Image B indicates the cartoon-esque influence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book in the foreground visibly longer than a normal book, with an elongated shape that exceeds typical proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration style doesn't emphasize elongated proportions for the book beyond what is typical. The book seems of standard size and consistent with the original depiction in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sleeves display soft, flowing drapery with visible folds and gentle curvature, suggesting fabric texture and movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves appear more rigid and lack the detail of gentle folds and flow seen in Image A. They maintain simple lines consistent with the stylized cartoon approach, unlike the realistic texture in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the buttons on the figureâ€™s garment decorated with visible golden filigree patterns, such as delicate engravings or ornate designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons are illustrated simply without ornate designs or golden filigree details. This is consistent with the stylized cartoon approach and lacks the ornate detailing that might be found in an ornate garment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the library shelves stylized or positioned to form a wooden frame around the central figure and scene, creating a framed composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the library shelves are part of an overall stylized illustration rather than forming a dedicated wooden frame. They contribute to the scene but do not actively frame the composition in an outlined manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are visual elements such as warm lighting, aged books, wooden surfaces, and focused reading posture present to enhance the scholarly atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains elements such as a reading posture, wooden surfaces, and bookshelf elements. However, it lacks the nuanced warm lighting and detailed aged books visible in Image A, which are essential for evoking a scholarly atmosphere.",
