      "question": "Has the baby elephant been transformed into a cartoon character while keeping the original pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby elephant has been rendered in a cartoon style with exaggerated features, like larger eyes and a smaller body. This indicates that the baby elephant has been transformed into a cartoon character. The pose appears to maintain the key features of a sitting position, common in representing cuteness in cartoon portrayals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a baby elephant that is designed with rounded proportions, smooth lines, large expressive eyes, and a friendly facial expression, all elements typical of a cute cartoon style. These visual cues contribute to an overall soft and approachable appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'First Splash!' is displayed at the top and 'Ele-Baby' is beneath the cartoon elephant. These texts are prominent and part of the design, suggesting they are intentionally included elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cartoon baby elephant along with texts 'First Splash!' and 'Ele-Baby' on a background that appears to be transparent, as there is a grid pattern, commonly used to indicate transparency. This suggests that the text and imagery are separated from any solid background.",

      "question": "Is the pose of the cartoon baby elephant identical to the original baby elephant's pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon baby elephant in a sitting position, with its trunk raised and ears protruding outwards, which is likely a creative depiction maintaining the general idea of a baby elephant’s pose often seen in cartoons. However, without referring to the precise details of Image A, it's difficult to ascertain absolute identicalness of pose, especially concerning original photograph pose versus artistic interpretation.",
