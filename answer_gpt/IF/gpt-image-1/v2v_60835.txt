    "Question": "Q1: Have the cheetahs' leg joints been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' legs are depicted as mechanical constructs with evident brass elements in the form of pistons and gears, which are visual indicators of a steampunk or robotic design rather than biological features. From world knowledge, the brass and mechanical elements are associated with machinery and steampunk aesthetics. Hence, it indicates that the cheetahs' leg joints have been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears.",

    "Question": "Q2: Has the cheetahs' spotted fur been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, parts of the cheetahs' bodies show textures and colors that align with leather and copper. This can be seen on their body sections which are segmented into mechanical parts instead of natural fur, resembling tooled leather and copper plating commonly seen in steampunk and crafted designs. Based on world knowledge, such materials are typically used in creating intricate mechanical and aesthetic designs. Thus, the cheetahs' spotted fur has been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are there towering, fantastical clockwork structures visible in the distant savanna horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon features tall structures that are visually complex and resemble clockwork mechanisms with gears and towers, indicative of a fantastical and mechanical style. Such structures are not commonly found in natural landscapes and align with themes of science fiction and fantasy settings. These towers are an addition of imaginative elements, implying their presence in the edited image. Therefore, there are indeed towering, fantastical clockwork structures visible in the distant savanna horizon.",
