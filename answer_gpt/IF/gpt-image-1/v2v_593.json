      "question": "Has the kangaroo been redesigned to resemble a Funko Pop figure box in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kangaroo can be seen within a box that is styled similar to a Funko Pop figure box, as it has typical features like a cartoon-style illustration, the 'Pop!' logo, and an isometric view showcasing both the figure and the box. The packaging includes these design elements, corroborating that the kangaroo has indeed been redesigned to resemble a Funko Pop in an isometric perspective.",

      "question": "Is the packaging labeled with the name \"BOUNCY COMPANION\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B clearly displays the text 'BOUNCY COMPANION' at the bottom, underneath the figure illustration, which indicates the name of the product. This consistent labeling is typical for branded collectible figures like Funko Pop and confirms the label name mentioned.",

      "question": "Does the box contain a chibi-style kangaroo figure with a pouch, a grassy base, and hopping-related elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the box in Image B, we see a chibi-style figure resembling a kangaroo with exaggerated features such as large eyes and a simplified design. The kangaroo figure is positioned on a grassy base and appears to be in a hopping pose, representing hopping-related elements consistent with common chibi figures. This supports the interpretation of elements mentioned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a highly realistic version of the kangaroo figure depicted outside the packaging with intricate textures and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a highly realistic kangaroo figure outside the packaging. Instead, it shows a stylized, cartoonish kangaroo figure positioned on the grass base similar to the figure inside the box. The design is consistent with a collectible vinyl toy and lacks intricate textures or realistic depiction as seen in highly detailed versions. Hence, the depiction remains stylized rather than realistic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the original kangaroo's pose and setting been maintained while integrating the new elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a real kangaroo hopping in a natural environment, whereas in Image B, the kangaroo is represented in a chibi form within a box and positioned outside. The setting has shifted from a naturalistic path to a collectible figure's display context with grassy elements, indicating a change in both pose and setting. Therefore, the original pose and setting have not been maintained.",
