      "question": "Has the hairstyle been transformed into a swirling, fluffy cotton candy form with pastel pink and blue hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle appears to be designed in a whimsical manner with swirls and voluminous texture, reminiscent of cotton candy. Its colors are pastel pink and blue, which are commonly associated with cotton candy.

      "question": "Has the suit been replaced with a stylized 3D paper doll version featuring a glossy surface and bold geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit appears cartoonish and does not exhibit a typical glossy surface associated with 3D objects. Instead, it features solid, flat colors without intricate geometric patterns, lacking the characteristic shine or texture of paper doll materials. Based on visual analysis, it does not fit the description of a stylized 3D glossy appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tie in Image B is depicted with bright, vivid colors, specifically orange with yellow stripes, and appears larger than a standard tie, resembling an exaggerated cartoon style. This assessment stems from the visual impression of its size and color contrast, fitting the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B have been blurred, making it impossible to determine if they remain unchanged compared to another image. Therefore, no comparison or change analysis can be made on the facial features.",

      "question": "Are all modified elements (hair, clothing, tie) visually consistent with their respective stylized forms (cotton candy, paper doll, cartoon) and not mixed with realistic details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair, clothing, and tie all exhibit a consistent stylized appearance. The hair looks like cotton candy, the suit is flat and cartoonish, and the tie is exaggerated and brightly colored. These elements lack realistic textures or details, fitting their intended stylized forms, which confirms the visual consistency described.",
