    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bedspread composed of multicolored LEGO-style blocks arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedspread features distinct colored blocks with the iconic circular studs found on LEGO bricks, forming a pattern similar to patchwork. The alternating and multicolored blocks resemble LEGO pieces, indicating a playful design based on LEGO aesthetics.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sports balls on the quilt represented by circular arrangements of LEGO-style tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no sports balls present on the quilt. The bedspread is entirely composed of LEGO-style blocks without any representations or designs that resemble sports balls. This change suggests a focus solely on the LEGO theme.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pillow that matches the bedspread's LEGO-style block pattern, but it maintains a standard pillow shape rather than a cube-shaped object. The pillow cover features the same design elements, but the object's form remains consistent with typical bedding shapes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bed resting on a flat white surface, and the base and sides of the bed feature the familiar LEGO pattern with circular studs, resembling a LEGO baseplate. This design element reinforces the LEGO theme throughout the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed a plain, uninterrupted white surface, devoid of any windows, walls, furniture, or additional decor items. This stark minimalism enhances the focus on the LEGO-themed bed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No (unless explicitly stated; default assumption is only the baseplate is LEGO)",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bed frame and parts of the mattress styled with the characteristic circular studs found on LEGO bricks. This design detail makes the bed resemble LEGO material, contributing to the overall LEGO-inspired theme of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is completely focused on the LEGO theme with no additional objects, such as a soccer ball, lamp, or framed picture. The setting is void of any non-LEGO items, contrasting with the original image which contained such elements.",
