    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image maintain an aspect ratio of 3:2?",
    "explanation": "The aspect ratio refers to the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image. In Image B, a rough estimation based on the visible framing suggests that the width is more prevalent relative to the height, commonly matching a 3:2 ratio which is a standard for many images. This conclusion comes from visually comparing spatial dimensions typically associated with the aspect ratio in photography.",
    "answer": "Yes"
