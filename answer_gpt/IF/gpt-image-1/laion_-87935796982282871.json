      "question": "Is the surface of the bed covered in patchwork fur made from the colors red, gray, navy, and white, resembling animal fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the bed indeed gives the appearance of patchwork that resembles animal fur due to its texture and design. The colors visible in the patchwork are red, gray, navy, and white, which are typical colors for creating a visually interesting fur-like appearance. The textural feel is enhanced by the visual cues suggesting a fur-like material.",

      "question": "Are the pillows reshaped into pointed or rounded ears and trimmed with soft-looking leaves along their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases pillows that are creatively transformed to appear like the head of a fox with pointed ears. The ears are finely detailed to include soft-looking green leaves, which adds to the artistic redesign of the pillow into an animal-head-like form. Such details are part of a whimsical or imaginative style not present in ordinary pillows.",

      "question": "Has the black bed frame been replaced with thin, branch-like legs that resemble natural tree limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the bed frame appears to have been replaced with thin, branch-like structures that mimic natural tree limbs. This transformation gives an organic, nature-inspired aesthetic, replacing the usual solid black bed frame from Image A. The legs are stylized in a way to look like interconnected branches, a significant departure from standard bed frames.",

      "question": "Is there a bushy, plush red tail extending from the bottom edge of the comforter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a bushy, plush red tail visibly extending from the bottom edge of the comforter. This imaginative addition further transforms the bedding scenario into an animal-like form, enhancing the thematic continuity of the edited image to resemble a creature rather than just a bed setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the patchwork fur on the bed use only the colors red, gray, navy, and white as seen in the original blanket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the patchwork fur on the bed primarily uses the colors red and gray, along with the visual addition of a navy blue color. While these are similar in kind to those seen in Image A, Image B may have slight artistic variations due to the fur texture but still aligns with the original blanket's color scheme.",
