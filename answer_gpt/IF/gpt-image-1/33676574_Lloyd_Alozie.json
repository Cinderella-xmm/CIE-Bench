      "question": "Do the skyscrapers appear as integrated, articulated robotic limbs forming a larger guardian-like figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure looks like a robotic guardian with articulated limbs, appearing to extend from or integrate into the structures in the background. The skyscrapers have features that resemble robotic or mechanical parts, contributing to the impression of a larger integrated robotic figure. This is likely achieved through artistic design choices that blend the architecture with the form of the guardian figure.",

      "question": "Are there visible neon circuitry patterns running along the facades of the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing neon patterns can be seen running along the facade of the central robotic figure which resembles futuristic circuitry. These patterns contribute to the tech-centric theme and are visually distinctive against the darker background, resembling designs often seen in robotics and advanced technology aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the expressways depicted as glowing, curving, spine-like structures emitting light and winding through the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, curved glowing elements are visible, emanating from the central figure and extending outwards. These features have a spine-like appearance due to their curvature and light emission, reminiscent of expressways intersecting a cityscape within a futuristic setting.",

      "question": "Do the tops of the buildings feature enhanced, fin-like vertical structures that resemble mechanical protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of several buildings, including those of the robotic figure in foreground, have fin-like structures that resemble mechanical protrusions. The design emphasizes an enhanced mechanical aesthetic, consistent with the overall futuristic theme.",

      "question": "Are there rotating holographic elements positioned across the skyline that resemble pulsing, eye-like forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several circular, glowing elements are floating and positioned around the skyline. These resemble holographic manifestations and have eye-like contours and pulsing motifs, consistent with concepts of sci-fi or virtual reality environments.",
