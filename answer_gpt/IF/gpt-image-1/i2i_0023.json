        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents distinct and clear outlines surrounding the boy and the birds, which is a key aspect of illustrations to differentiate various elements and add emphasis. The bold lines make each figure stand out clearly.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large areas of singular, flat colors are used to depict the boy’s skin and the birds' feathers, typical of illustrations where shading and texture details are minimized to achieve a cleaner and more stylized look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has no visible background features, creating a focus solely on the figures of the boy and birds. This method often helps eliminate distractions and simplify the composition, common in sticker design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the boy’s head been slightly enlarged and the birds shrunk to achieve a neatly arranged composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison between Image B and Image A shows that the proportion of the boy's head remains similar while the birds have been scaled to fit proportionately within the sticker design. This adjustment might be minor but serves to balance the composition in illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) contains a thick white outline encompassing the entire illustration. This is a common technique used to define the edges and create a cutout effect making it suitable for sticker designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image have a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figures against an absence of any solid colored or patterned background, often indicating transparency. This allows the design to be placed over various surfaces without a conflicting backdrop, which is typical for stickers.",
