    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pelican rendered in a cartoon-style with simplified and exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican is depicted as a chibi-style cartoon characterized by exaggerated proportions, including a large head, bulging eyes, and a stylized body, which aligns with the common cartoon aesthetics that simplify and exaggerate features for comedic and playful effect.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the pelican’s beak been visibly exaggerated in size or shape compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is drawn larger and in a vibrant orange color which appears exaggerated compared to a realistic depiction. Image A shows a naturally-sized beak typical of pelicans, suggesting that the edited version emphasizes the beak size for stylistic enhancement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features notably large, round eyes consistent with cartoon style, which often incorporates such features for humor and expression. In contrast, Image A shows the pelican with normal-sized eyes appropriate to its avian nature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the pelican with feathers in pastel shades of blue and pink, typical for cartoon adaptations that favor playful, colorful palettes. The real pelican in Image A has naturally colored, grayish feathers not meant to attract aesthetic attention.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a detailed rendering of natural feather textures with intricate lines and shading. Image B simplifies the feather textures to uniform shapes with color blocking typical of cartoon art, foregoing realistic textures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
