      "question": "Is the ceiling fan enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a fan placed inside a glass dome, characteristic of a snow globe, with a wooden base, which is visually distinct from a ceiling-mounted fan. This indicates that the fan is indeed enclosed within a snow globe, which is consistent with the common design of decorative snow globes that encase figures within a clear sphere.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest atop a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe situated on what appears to be a flat surface, resembling a tabletop. The lighting is warm and soft, casting gentle shadows typical of ambient light settings, with a simplistic background design that emphasizes minimalism. These visual cues indicate that the snow globe is indeed resting on a tabletop under such conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B do not show any shimmering effects or reflections on surrounding surfaces that would suggest light passing through the glass of the snow globe is causing such effects. The focus is more on the snow globe itself, and the surrounding area appears evenly lit without specific shimmering highlights.",

      "question": "Is the fan inside the snow globe depicted in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan inside the snow globe is designed with exaggerated features and vibrant colors that give it a playful and cartoon-like appearance. The three-dimensionality, combined with the soft curves and simple texture details, aligns with a cartoon-style design often found in stylized 3D models.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the snow globe contains visual elements that resemble snowflakes scattered throughout, appearing to float in the air. These snowflakes are consistent with the typical aesthetic of a snow globe, which often depicts scenes with drifting snow inside.",
