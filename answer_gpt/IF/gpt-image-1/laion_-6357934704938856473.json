      "question": "Does the robot exhibit a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot has a consistent metallic appearance, which indicates a brushed metal finish, and its surface does not reflect light excessively, suggesting a matte finish. This conclusion is drawn from the texture and light reflection seen on the robot's armor.",
