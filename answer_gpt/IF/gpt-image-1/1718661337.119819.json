      "question": "Is the officer wearing a brown leather trench coat instead of the original naval uniform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show the officer wearing a brown leather trench coat with visible mechanical components. This contrasts with the original naval uniform which was blue with gold trim, as seen in world knowledge references to historical naval attire. By analyzing the color, texture, and design of the coat, it can be reasoned that the officer is now wearing a brown leather trench coat, indicating a shift in style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the officer’s clothing features brass gears and other mechanical components attached to the front, indicative of a steampunk aesthetic. These elements are not present in the original naval uniform from Image A, which is void of such mechanical adornments.",

      "question": "Is the object in the officer's right hand a chronometer-like gadget instead of a bell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in the officer’s right hand in Image B is visibly different from Image A. It appears as a chronometer-like gadget, with clock-like features, contrasting the bell held in the original image. This analysis is supported by observing the design and details of the object in Image B.",
