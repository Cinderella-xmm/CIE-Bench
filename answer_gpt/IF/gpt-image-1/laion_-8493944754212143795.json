    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the waterfall and surrounding rocks visibly transformed into the shape of an aquatic dragon emerging from the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of a mythical aquatic dragon with a detailed head, flowing mane, and a partially visible body with scales, distinct from the natural waterfall scene in Image A. The visual elements like the dragon's serpentine body, scales, and facial features are indicative of a dragon rather than a natural formation. This shows intentional artistry to transform the original scene into a mythical creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the flowing water appear as a shimmering, translucent mane extending from the dragon’s head or neck area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears as a wispy, flowing mane extends from the dragon's head. The mane is depicted with a luminous and translucent quality, suggesting it is crafted to mimic flowing water but in a more mythical sense, which is different from the natural flowing water seen in Image A that follows the contours of the rocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocks reshaped into a scale-armored body structure that forms the torso or limbs of the dragon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the dragon with a textured, scale-like armor on its body, which resembles reptilian scales rather than natural rock formations. This is a stylistic transformation from the rugged, irregular shapes of the rocks in Image A to smooth, purposeful scales implying a mythic creature's skin.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the white foam areas form two distinct, misty cloud-like wings attached to the dragon’s back or sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no depiction of wings in Image B. The dragon's anatomy lacks any extensions resembling wings, contrary to the misty elements you might associate with wings. The image focuses more on the dragon's body and the surrounding water without forming any additional anatomical features similar to wings.",

      "question": "Are there glowing blue runes visible along the dragon’s scales, appearing as luminous symbols or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the dragon's scales, there are various glowing blue symbols resembling runes. These do not appear in the natural image of Image A, indicating an intended mystical and magical enhancement that contributes to the dragon's mythical aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image convey a mystical atmosphere through glowing effects, translucent textures, or ethereal lighting around the dragon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is imbued with mystical elements, such as the glowing runes, the translucent mane, and ethereal lighting that surrounds the dragon, enhancing the magical and mythic atmosphere. These elements distinguish it from the straightforward depiction of natural elements in Image A.",
