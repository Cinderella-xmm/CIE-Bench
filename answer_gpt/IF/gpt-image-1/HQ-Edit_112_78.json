      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle holder with a visible candle or wick structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has transformed into a candle holder. There is a clear view of an open candle insert with three visible wicks positioned at equal distances, indicating a candle setup. The absence of a traditional teapot spout further confirms it's a candle holder rather than a teapot. By combining visual cues with knowledge of common candle features, it is evident that a candle has replaced the previous teapot's function.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object's body is made of clear glass, which is evident given its transparency revealing interior elements. The surface of the glass displays visible intricate embossed patterns, as seen in the decorative designs etched into the glass. These patterns resemble typical decorative glassware, distinct from the metallic material observed in the teapot.",

      "question": "Has the lid been redesigned into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer with a snuffing mechanism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a decorative element atop the container that resembles a candle snuffer. The intricate design and the pointed structure suggest its use as a decorative finial. It aligns with typical designs of candle snuffers that have a functional yet aesthetically pleasing form. Given its placement and design, it appears to be intended as a decorative candle snuffer.",

      "question": "Has the tablecloth been replaced with a sleek, reflective marble base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is positioned on a circular base featuring the classic veins and shine associated with marble, indicating a transition from fabric to stone. The absence of the draped and textured pattern of a lace tablecloth, as seen in the Image A, further supports the transition to a marble surface beneath the candle holder.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly visible nameplate on the side of the candle container, which is not only prominent due to its contrasting color but also contains the text 'Elegance Aroma'. This is indicative of standard branding often found on artisanal or specialty candles.",
