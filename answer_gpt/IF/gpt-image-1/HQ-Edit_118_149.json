        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed two distinct sticker versions of the ballet dancer. The stickers are stylistically different, resulting in two unique representations.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
