      "question": "Has the vase been replaced with a structure composed entirely of flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that the vase is composed entirely of red flowers, whereas in Image A, the vase was made of metal with intricate patterns. This change suggests that the material of the vase has been replaced with flowers. Logical reasoning combines the visual evidence in Image B with knowledge about typical vases to conclude that the structure has indeed been replaced by flowers.",

      "question": "Do the floral details follow and blend with the contours of the vase's original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the vase is composed of flowers, the overall silhouette still resembles the typical form of a vase with a narrow neck and bulbous body similar to Image A’s vase. This suggests the floral arrangement intentionally follows the original contours. The reasoning combines the visual comparison with common principles of art that respect original outlines while applying different materials.",

      "question": "Does the design prioritize artistic and imaginative expression over functional realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s design features flowers in place of traditional vase materials, which is not practical for a functional vase meant to hold water and support flowers. Instead, it showcases artistic creativity by seamlessly integrating floral elements into the vase form. This aligns with knowledge in art where the priority is expressive rather than functional realism, leading to the conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the final design present a unique and innovative interpretation rather than a conventional vase appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s vase is transformed creatively using flowers, providing a fresh take on vase design that departs from conventional materials like ceramic or metal seen in Image A. The design diverges from traditional approaches, representing artistic innovation. Comparison with common vase designs shows the imaginative transformation in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed vase retain the original shape and structure while being composed of flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the arrangement of flowers maintains the original vase shape—characterized by its recognizable silhouette—despite the change in material. Comparing it with the vase in Image A confirms the retention of structural and shape qualities. World knowledge on design consistency affirms the shape retention without altering its primary form.",
