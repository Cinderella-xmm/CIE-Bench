      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire image, including the cosmic vortex and forest landscape, rendered in the style of a stained glass window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays characteristics of a stained glass window. The image is composed of sections divided by black lines which mimic the appearance of lead cames used in stained glass art. The fragmented and colored sections create a mosaic effect, clearly showcasing a stained glass style throughout the cosmic vortex and forest landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spiral patterns of the cosmic vortex outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines resembling lead cames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral patterns within the cosmic vortex are indeed outlined with thick, dark lines. These lines run continuously throughout the image, mimicking lead cames often used to join glass pieces in stained glass artwork, providing the characteristic stained glass appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sky and tree canopies depicted using deep, saturated colors such as deep blues, purples, reds, and greens characteristic of jewel tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the usage of deep, saturated colors across the sky and tree canopies. The colors include deep blues, purples, and reds, which are typical of jewel tones. These colors contribute to a rich, vibrant visual that is commonly seen in stained glass art.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the stained glass elements (including the spiral and trees) exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures that simulate light refraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stained glass elements in Image B, such as the spiral and tree sections, exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures. These simulate the refraction effects seen in stained glass art, where facets and angles cause variations in light and color distribution across the surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature soft, glowing light effects, smooth color transitions, and balanced composition that evoke a sense of calm and serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being in the style of stained glass, does not feature soft glowing light effects or smooth color transitions as found in typical serene scenes. Stained glass art often uses sharp contrasts and fragmented color sections, providing a different quality to the atmosphere which emphasizes vibrancy over calmness.",
