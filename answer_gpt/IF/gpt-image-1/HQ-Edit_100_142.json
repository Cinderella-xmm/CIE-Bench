      "question": "Does the edited image display visible, textured brushstrokes across the entire composition, consistent with Impressionist painting techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible textured brushstrokes are evident throughout the image, characteristic of Impressionist techniques. They create a sense of movement and vibrancy by capturing light and color variably. The image's surface does not appear smooth or photographic but shows painterly application of paint, which aligns with Impressionist styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the scene lit with warm, golden-hour lighting suggestive of dusk, with soft shadows and a glowing horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a scene with a predominant use of warm tones, such as oranges and golds, suggesting the golden hour type of lighting. The horizon's glow enhances this effect, and although the shadows are not pronounced due to the style, the overall color temperature suggests soft dusk lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the patterns and colors of the subjectâ€™s clothing rendered with thick, visible brushstrokes that exaggerate their vibrancy and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing's patterns and colors are exaggerated, with thick brushstrokes being clearly visible. These strokes enhance the vibrancy of the colors, creating an impressionistic style that prioritizes abstract, vivid expression over realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of soft, blended warm golden hues with no distinct details, creating a hazy, atmospheric effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background uses warm golden hues blended together, maintaining a streaky texture but eschewing detailed representation. This results in a soft, atmospheric effect that is typical of Impressionistic renditions, where specifics are lost in favor of mood and light.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the drum surface show layered, textured paint application that gives it a three-dimensional, tactile appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drum in Image B is painted with textured strokes that give it a layered, tactile look, enhancing its three-dimensionality. This effect aligns with artistic techniques where texture is used to suggest form and depth in a painterly manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the grass and trees in the background stylized with flowing or angular forms that visually mirror the rhythmic motion of the drummer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the grass and trees do not visually mirror the rhythmic motion of the drummer in a clear, analogous manner, their forms are stylized and integrated into the overall flow and texture of the painting, suggesting motion through their impressionistic rendering, though not specifically reflecting drumming rhythms.",
