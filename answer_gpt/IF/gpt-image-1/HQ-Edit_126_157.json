    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear wooden frame is visible around the entire scene. The texture and structure of the frame resemble hand-carved wood, providing a border enclosing the depicted image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B gives the impression of being composed of separate elements, likely due to the stylized artistic presentation. The elements such as the boat, water, and hills seem to be intentionally crafted as individual parts, resembling layers rather than merging into a single photographic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat appears smooth and stylized rather than realistically textured. There are no clear indications of aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, or signs of weathering visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hills are colored with soft, pastel-like blue gradients rather than realistic tones. This coloring creates an artistic effect rather than a realistic portrayal of hills.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible droplet-like etchings above the water, indicating a layer utilized to give the appearance of raindrops or to mimic water ripples through an artistic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the elements in a layered fashion, with each component such as the boat, water, and hills appearing distinct and separate, contributing to a perception of depth through their arrangement as individual layers.",
