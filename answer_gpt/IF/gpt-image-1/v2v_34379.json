    {

      "question": "Are the vegetables in the dish visibly smaller than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli and cauliflower florets appear smaller when compared to their size in Image A. The dish has fewer florets and more space between them, indicating a reduction in size. This observation is based on noticing that each vegetable takes up less space within the dish, suggesting they have shrunk.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the space between the vegetables increased due to their shrinkage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows more space between each vegetable piece compared to Image A. The reduction in vegetable size allows for increased gaps, logically indicating increased spacing due to shrinkage. This assessment is based on evaluating the spatial arrangement within the dish.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vegetables maintain their original shapes and colors despite being smaller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables maintain their original shapes and colors despite being smaller. The broccoli retains its green hue and characteristic shape, and the cauliflower remains white. This conclusion comes from observing the morphology and coloration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the size of the dish holding the vegetables unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and B show dishes of the same size. The dimensions and style of the dish appear constant, with only the content being altered. This observation comes from evaluating the dish itself, which remains consistent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any new elements been added or existing elements removed besides shrinking the vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image B with Image A, it is clear that no new elements have been added or removed beyond shrinking the vegetables. The dish only contains broccoli and cauliflower in both images. This conclusion is based on identifying all elements present in both images.",
