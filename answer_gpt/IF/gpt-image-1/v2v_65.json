        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a transparent sphere is present that contains a scene inside, which is characteristic of a snow globe. This globe encloses a figure along with other small elements, indicating that the scene is now set inside a snow globe. Snow globes are typically decorative items that encapsulate miniature scenes within a clear dome. Based on this understanding, the original scene has been edited to be enclosed within a snow globe.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the snow globe is sitting on a structure resembling a stone pedestal, which is often used as a base for decorative items like snow globes. Additionally, the background includes a partially visible frosty window, identifiable by the icy patterns and the diffused light typical of cold environments. This combination suggests the presence of both a stone pedestal and a frosty window in the image.",

      "question": "Does the background outside the frosty window show a snowy mountain range?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, although the window appears frosty, there isn't a clear depiction of a snowy mountain range outside of it. Frosted glass usually obscures details, so without further visible evidence of mountains beyond the frosty window, we cannot confirm the presence of a snowy mountain range in the background. Thus, the image does not explicitly show a snowy mountain range.",

      "question": "Has the character inside the globe been transformed into a stylized 3D chibi appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the character within the globe has a cartoonish, miniature appearance, characterized by exaggerated proportions such as a larger head in relation to the body, typical of chibi stylization. This indicates that the character has been transformed into a stylized 3D chibi form, which is a common design choice for creating cute, diminutive models in illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there tiny evergreen trees and miniature mountain peaks surrounding the character inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe depicted in the edited image, there are visual elements resembling small pine trees and terrain-like shapes that could be interpreted as miniature mountain peaks surrounding the central character. Evergreen trees are commonly included in such designs for their association with snowy landscapes, and the appearance of peaks fits within the stylized, miniature diorama setting typical for snow globes.",
