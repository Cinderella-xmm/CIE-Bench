      "question": "Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure resembles a mechanical, insect-like creature with a distinct body and limb-like structures. The central dome is incorporated into a larger body that resembles a creature, and it has appendages distinct from traditional architectural features. This transformation and configuration are vastly different from typical architecture, transitioning instead into an imaginative form that suggests a creature-like figure. Therefore, the visual cues combined with common sense knowledge of creature designs indicate that the Hagia Sophia is transformed into a creature-like figure with distinctive structural elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays several smaller domes attached to the main structure, resembling large, metallic appendages that extend outward like wings. These elements are visually reminiscent of winged features found in creatures or intricate machinery designs. The characteristic extending and overlapping pattern of these appendages visually differentiates them from architectural structures not designed to resemble wings, suggesting a transformation into wing-like features.",

      "question": "Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts long, slender structures reminiscent of legs supporting the overall body of the creature. However, upon closer observation of the image, it becomes evident that these structures are visually consistent with traditional minarets rather than being transformed into leg-like appendages. While they maintain a slender appearance, they continue to be identifiably minarets in their design and positioning.",

      "question": "Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structureâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are intricate and ornate patterns that have a glowing appearance on the surface of the edited structure. These patterns are reminiscent of elaborate designs found in Byzantine art, with their detailed and ornate characteristics. The design complexity suggests artistic influences similar to Byzantine motifs, as they are visually aligned with intricate historical decorations.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central dome in Image B has transformed into a large, round element distinct from its original design. This transformed structure prominently features cosmic imagery, including stars, nebulae, and galaxies, visualizing a celestial, jewel-like object at its center. The transformation is evident, taking a classic architectural component into an imaginative cosmic feature. Comparing this to the known features of Hagia Sophia's domes, the transition to display intricate cosmic elements indicates a deliberate replacement with a jewel-like object.",
