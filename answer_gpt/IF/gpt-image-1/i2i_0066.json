      "question": "Has the vase and bouquet been transformed into a 3D printed display model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a structured object that resembles a vase and bouquet, likely made through a 3D printing process. The uniform color and texture suggest that it is a single material object rather than a real vase with flowers. This aligns with common features of 3D printed models which have a monochromatic and solid appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D printed model appear to be made of matte material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D printed model in Image B appears to have a non-reflective, even surface. This indicates a matte finish. The texture of the material does not suggest shine or gloss, which is consistent with matte materials typically used in 3D printing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a display plaque added at the base of the 3D printed model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible rectangular base beneath the model with text on it, suggesting it is a display plaque. This kind of plaque is typical for display models to indicate their name or theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Has the background been set as a tech expo booth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows elements typically found in a tech expo environment: modern design banners, information screens, and a clean, professional setup. Such visuals are indicative of a tech expo booth setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the 3D printed model maintain the design of the original vase and bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B to Image A, the bouquet of flowers remains in a vase atop a skateboard with a bulldog. The specific arrangement and proportions in the 3D model align with the design from Image A, indicating that despite being converted to a 3D model, the core design of the vase and bouquet is maintained.",
