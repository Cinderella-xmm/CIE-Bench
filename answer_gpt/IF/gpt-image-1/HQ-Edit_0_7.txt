    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene with the parrot appears to be enclosed within a glass dome. The rounded, transparent structure with reflective highlights around the edge suggests a glass-like material. Given the smooth presentation and the design commonly associated with dioramas or protective displays, it is logical to conclude that the scene is enclosed in a glass dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the parrot depicted in a chibi style with a large head and simplified body proportions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a parrot with a disproportionately large head and round, cartoonish features, characteristic of chibi style, which often includes exaggerated and simplified forms. This artistic choice aligns with common representations in chibi art, where the head is oversized relative to the body and the features are minimalistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the leaves surrounding the parrot significantly larger than normal scale and vibrant in color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves surrounding the parrot appear to be relatively large in comparison to the chibi style parrot, but given the parrot's exaggerated proportions, they do not seem oversized by normal standards. The colors are bright but not excessively vibrant to an unrealistic extent, maintaining a harmonious aesthetic instead.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small, shiny, crystal-like beads visible on the surface of the leaves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visual cues indicating the presence of small, shiny, crystal-like beads on the surface of the leaves. The leaves appear smooth and evenly colored, lacking any reflective or crystal-like adornments.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a tiny human figure on a different branch, holding a sketchbook or drawing tool and facing the parrot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a tiny human figure is present and is shown sitting on a branch, clearly facing the parrot with an object that resembles a sketchbook or drawing tool in hand. This suggests the figure is engaged in an activity like sketching or observing the parrot closely.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the base of the glass dome feature a wooden texture with carved or etched tribal patterns?",
    "explanation": "The base of the glass dome in Image B features a texture that resembles wood, along with carved or etched patterns that could be interpreted as tribal motifs. This is indicated by the consistent coloration and textural patterns typically associated with natural wood and traditional designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the diorama include visual elements such as dense foliage, mist, or warm ambient lighting that suggest a rainforest environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature visual elements like dense foliage, mist, or warm ambient lighting typical of a rainforest environment. Instead, the background is simple and focuses on a few elements inside the glass dome, which does not convey the complexity or conditions of a rainforest setting.",
    "answer": "No"
