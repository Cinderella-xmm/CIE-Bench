      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the boot transformed into a sculpture-like object with a rigid, stylized structure consistent with Art Deco aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot exhibits characteristics of a rigid structure with sharp, stylized designs reminiscent of Art Deco aesthetics. These include symmetrical geometric patterns and angular shapes that suggest a sculptural transformation. Art Deco is known for its bold geometric forms and clean lines, which are evident in the boot's transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embroidered floral patterns replaced with geometric designs such as zigzags, chevrons, or sunburst motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features geometric designs that replace the original floral patterns. The transformations visible are zigzags, chevrons, or similar angular motifs consistent with geometric patterns, which stands in contrast to the typical curved floral designs typically found on cowboy boots.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative elements on the boot have a metallic sheen and appear as inlaid metal plates or strips rather than stitched leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot displays a metallic sheen and the decorative elements appear to be made of metal rather than leather. The reflective surface indicates the use of materials such as metal plates or strips, which contrast with the stitched leather seen in typical cowboy boot designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the heel been redesigned into a stepped, multi-tiered architectural shape with sharp angles and vertical emphasis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a heel that has been transformed into a multi-tiered architectural shape with distinct sharp angles and a vertical structure. This design signifies a move away from the traditional flat or slightly raised heel to a more stylized, structured form that echoes architectural design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot surface exhibit a hard, reflective, non-leather-like finish consistent with metal or polished stone, indicating a sculptural material change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the boot in Image B exhibits a shiny, hard, and reflective finish, similar to metal or polished stone, as opposed to the textured finish of leather seen in Image A. This indicates a significant change in material achieving a more sculptural appearance.",
