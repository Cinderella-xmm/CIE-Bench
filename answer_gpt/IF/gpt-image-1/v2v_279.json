      "question": "Has the bird been converted into a 3D chibi-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To answer this question, we observe Image B, where the bird appears rounded and stylized with exaggerated features, such as large eyes typical of chibi styles, giving it a playful and cute appearance. This contrasts with Image A, where the bird is depicted realistically. Hence, this transformation indicates a conversion into a 3D chibi-style model.",

      "question": "Has the lemur been converted into a 3D chibi-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lemur shows characteristics typical of 3D chibi models, such as simplified shapes and larger eyes, resembling an animated or playful style. Image A depicts the lemur more realistically, without these stylized features. The presence of these styling changes suggests that the lemur has indeed been converted into a 3D chibi-style model.",

      "question": "Have the other characters in the scene been converted into 3D chibi-style models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although faces are blurred, the visible body parts of the characters, such as their hands and arms, display rounded and exaggerated proportions typical of 3D chibi models. This contrast with the realistic depiction in Image A suggests that the characters in the scene have been transformed into 3D chibi-style models.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the outfits and accessories of the characters preserved after being converted into 3D chibi-style models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters maintain their same attire and accessories seen in Image A, such as the pocket watch and clothing style, despite the stylistic transformation to chibi models. This indicates that such elements have been preserved in the conversion process.",

      "question": "Is the arrangement of the scene, including the positions of the characters, bird, and lemur, the same as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing both images, we see that the positions and general arrangement remain unchanged, with the bird, lemur, and characters positioned similarly in both images, closely maintaining the original composition despite the change in stylization. This signifies that the arrangement of the scene is consistent with the original image.",
