      "question": "Is the phrase 'Stories Through Time' present in the image using an elegant serif typeface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Stories Through Time' is clearly visible at the top of the image. The typeface used is serif, characterized by decorative strokes at the ends of the letters, which typically convey elegance. Serif fonts are commonly associated with classic and sophisticated design, supporting the notion of an elegant typeface choice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a distressed gold color that matches the typewriterâ€™s metallic tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text color appears to be a gold-like tone, which enhances the vintage feel. The typewriter in the image is rendered in a sepia or aged tone, rather than a metallic gold. The text's distressed gold appearance does complement the aged and vintage look but does not directly match the metallic tone of the typewriter since the typewriter no longer has its original metallic finish due to the sepia effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has a sepia filter been applied uniformly across the entire image to create an aged effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire image is covered with a sepia filter, giving it a warm, brownish tone reminiscent of old photographs. This uniform tone helps to create an aged, vintage effect throughout the image. This color grading is consistent over all elements, including the background, text, and typewriter.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible swirling, translucent pages emanating from the typewriter, appearing as if stories are emerging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible swirling forms that resemble translucent pages or ethereal sheets emanating from the typewriter. These forms are rendered in a way that makes them look as though they are emerging from the typewriter as if stories or creativity are being physically manifested, which gives an artistic representation of storytelling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature a decorative Art Deco-style border framing the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a border around the image that is consistent with Art Deco style characteristics, such as geometric shapes and elegant, symmetrical designs. This decorative border frames the scene, adding to the overall vintage and sophisticated aesthetic of the imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all visual elements (text, color scheme, ghostly pages, border) collectively contribute to a cohesive vintage literary poster aesthetic focused on storytelling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, every element from the serif typeface of the text, the sepia filter, the swirling translucent pages from the typewriter, and the Art Deco-style border collectively contribute to a strong vintage literary poster aesthetic. This aesthetic is focused on storytelling, as suggested by the text 'Stories Through Time' and the visual metaphor of pages emerging from the typewriter, creating a cohesive theme centered on the legacy and act of writing stories.",
