    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the building's facade composed of visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building’s facade is composed of clearly visible blocky LEGO-like bricks. These blocks are uniformly sized and textured typical of LEGO materials, helping form the overall structure. World knowledge supports recognizing LEGO bricks by their characteristic studded surface, reinforcing their identity as LEGO parts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the building’s bricks rendered in muted red tones and the window frames in muted blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the building’s bricks in muted red tones, consistent with common LEGO brick color palettes. The window frames are outlined with muted blue tones, adding contrast against the red bricks. Using world knowledge, muted colors in LEGOs serve as aesthetic choices for model architecture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the climbing plants been replaced with green, segmented LEGO-style vines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what were realistic climbing plants in Image A have been replaced with green LEGO-style vines, recognizable due to their segmented block-like structure. This is a characteristic LEGO approach using interlocking pieces to simulate organic shapes, aligning with how LEGO sets creatively mimic real-life elements with blocky shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all balconies feature gray, blocky LEGO-style railings instead of realistic metal or decorative designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays balconies with gray, blocky LEGO-style railings, deviating from more intricate designs observed in traditional architecture as seen in Image A. World knowledge points out that LEGO railing pieces tend to opt for basic shapes that are easy to replicate using the block principle, evident here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform that contrasts with the surrounding environment to highlight its blocky aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO building is situated on a flat, simple platform, known as a LEGO baseplate. This contrasts with the natural surroundings implied in realistic settings (Image A), and it highlights a distinct, structured, and intentional block aesthetic. LEGO models typically use such platforms to provide stability and form a coherent presentation layer.",
