      "question": "Has the formal suit been replaced with a vibrant, floral-patterned design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit features a colorful floral pattern with bright, bold flowers dominating the design. This contrasts starkly with the formal suit in Image A, which is characterized by a monochromatic color and texture typical of formal attire. The presence of multiple flowers of differing shapes and colors indicates a transformation from formal to vibrant, emphasizing a lighter and more creative style.",

      "question": "Has the bow tie been replaced with a bold, colorful design featuring geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bow tie in Image B has a distinctive design with intersecting lines creating geometric patterns in various colors like red, yellow, and orange, which contrasts with a typical formal, plaid bow tie seen in Image A. This drastic change suggests a deliberate shift to a more visually striking design embodying fun and creativity.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a distinct dotted texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of a dotted texture, reminiscent of halftone patterns used in graphic art, especially pop art. This change from the plain or subtly textured background in Image A indicates an artistic enhancement to add style and visual interest.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of pop art style, such as bold outlines, flat colors, and high contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B possesses many characteristics of pop art, including bold black outlines surrounding bright, flat-colored sections and areas of high contrast. These features are typical of pop art aesthetics, designed to stand out vividly in composition. Image A, in comparison, lacks these stark artistic elements, favoring a more subdued tone and detailed texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since both images have blurred the facial area, no details can be determined about facial features, expressions, or changes in posture between Images A and B. Therefore, we discern whether the components around the face, such as attire and background, have been altered instead, which they have.",
