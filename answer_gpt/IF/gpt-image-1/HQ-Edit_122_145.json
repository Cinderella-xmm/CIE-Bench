      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a chibi style with an oversized head, large eyes, and simplified proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures have an exaggerated style common in chibi illustrations, characterized by oversized heads, large eyes, and simplified body proportions.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns and bows are styled in a way that matches chibi representations—vibrant and somewhat exaggerated to increase visual impact within the simplified chibi form.

      "question": "Are there exactly four separate images of the chibi character, each in a unique pose corresponding to holding a cherry blossom branch, catching petals, gazing at blooming trees, and dancing amidst falling flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains four separate chibi images, each exhibiting unique poses and actions. They are visually distinct, with one holding a branch, another positioned as if catching petals, one gazing at flowers, and the last being in a dynamic pose suggesting dancing. The variations in pose indicate different activities associated with cherry blossoms.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the four images depict a clear and distinct action—holding a branch, catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing—with visible movement or interaction with cherry blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each depiction in Image B highlights specific actions or interactions with cherry blossoms: one holds a branch, another reaches out seemingly catching petals, one is posed gazing, and the last shows a dynamic stance implying dance. The different poses ensure each scene conveys a distinct activity or interaction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four images of the chibi character are arranged on a light pink surface. This pastel-colored base is typical of a magnetic sheet as it's common to use such backgrounds for displaying decorative magnets. The arrangement and the uniform surface suggest that they are displayed on a single magnetic sheet.",
