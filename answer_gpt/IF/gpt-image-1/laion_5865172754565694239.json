    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible, cartoon-style face with expressive features (eyes, mouth, etc.) drawn on the frame near the handlebars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame near the handlebars is stylized with a cartoon face, featuring expressive eyes and a wide, animated mouth. The depiction of these facial elements combined with common design practices for cartoon characters indicates an intentional design choice to add humor and personality. This contrasts with the non-decorative original frame in Image A. Thus, observing the visual cues in Image B leads to the conclusion that a cartoon-style face is indeed present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there cartoon-style limbs (arms or legs) visibly extending from the front and/or rear wheel hubs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements include cartoon-style arms and legs that extend from the vicinity of the rear and front wheel hubs. These are stylized to mimic the action and dynamic poses often seen in animated characters, suggesting movement and energy. By comparison, Image A lacks such features, with a standard wheel design devoid of anthropomorphic characteristics. Therefore, Image B clearly displays cartoon-style limbs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there dynamic motion lines (such as streaks or curved lines) surrounding the bike or its wheels to indicate speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses dynamic lines around the wheels and throughout the scene, a common graphic technique to visually represent motion or speed in comic illustrations. The presence of curved lines and angled streaks implies fast movement, consistent with animated or comic portrayals. Image A, as a photograph, lacks these artistic embellishments. Consequently, Image B features dynamic motion lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the red frame been redesigned to resemble a superhero suit, including visual elements like patterns, textures, or symbols associated with a hero costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the red frame with additional visual elements such as varied textures and forms that resemble a superhero costume, aligned with common superhero attire featuring symbolic designs and an emphasis on dynamism. This contrasts with Image A, where the bicycle frame is designed functionally without these superhero-themed adaptations. Consequently, the frame in Image B appears to mimic a superhero suit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there comic-style sound effect texts such as “Vroom!” or “Zoom!” overlaid on the image in a stylized, bold font typical of comic books?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes bold, stylized text overlaying the image, specifically the words “Vroom!” and “Zoom!”, which are typical of sound effects found in comic strips. These enhance the comic book aesthetic by contributing to the narrative dynamism and energy of the scene. Image A does not have such textual additions. Thus, Image B contains comic-style sound effect texts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a comic book aesthetic, including exaggerated features, bold lines, vibrant colors, and dynamic composition consistent with a lively animated character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed with exaggerated features and constructs, including bold lines and vibrant colors, characteristic of comic book art. Along with dynamic poses and engaging text, the image reflects the visual style and animated energy typical of comic media, setting it apart from the photographic realism of Image A. Therefore, Image B fully embodies a comic book aesthetic.",
