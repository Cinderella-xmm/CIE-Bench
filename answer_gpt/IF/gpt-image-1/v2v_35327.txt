    "Question": "Q1: Does the image exhibit characteristics of surrealism such as dreamlike or unexpected juxtapositions?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a blue figure holding a gold banana amid swirling, dreamlike patterns and colors. The overall composition creates an atmosphere that departs from reality, evoking a sense of dreamlike or fantastic imagery. Surrealism often employs unexpected juxtapositions, such as blending human figures with unusual, abstract elements. Here, the blue figure and gold banana, combined with swirling patterns, align well with surrealist traits.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there abstract shapes and bold contrasts present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are pronounced abstract shapes formed by the swirling patterns in the background and around the figure. The color palette contrasts deeply between the blue and gold hues, creating a visually striking composition. Such use of color and abstract design elements is characteristic of art that employs bold contrasts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold banana depicted as a levitating geometric form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold banana is held by the figure's hand rather than depicted as levitating. While there is an additional geometric form (a diamond shape) near the banana, the banana itself is not shown in a levitating state. The question specifically asks about the banana's depiction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the blue figure display liquefying textures?",
    "explanation": "The blue figure in Image B is enveloped by swirling lines and patterns that mimic liquefying textures. These patterns flow across the figure, contributing to an appearance as if the figure itself is blending and melting into the environment. The use of such texture enhances the surreal and fluid quality of the artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the background feature warped components that contribute to a fantastical atmosphere?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is replete with warped, swirling components that contribute to a fantastical atmosphere. These elements, due to their twisting forms and interaction with the figure, reinforce the surreal and dreamlike quality of the image, typical of a fantastical setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
