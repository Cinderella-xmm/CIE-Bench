      "question": "Is the unicorn's body rendered with a smooth, glazed, creamy white ceramic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn appears to be constructed from a material resembling glazed ceramic.
