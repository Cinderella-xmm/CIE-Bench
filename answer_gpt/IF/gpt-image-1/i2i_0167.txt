    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image include the apple's current front view as originally shown?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the apple is presented in several views, including a front view. One part of the collage displays the apple from a perspective similar to the original front view shown in Image A. Thus, the defining characteristics of the front view, such as its rounded shape and vibrant red color, are visible in at least one of the views. Therefore, Image B includes the apple's current front view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a cross-section view of the apple that shows its inner flesh texture and seeds?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), one section of the collage clearly shows a cross-section of the apple. This view reveals the inner flesh texture, which appears smooth and creamy, along with the presence of seeds located symmetrically near the center. This provides an accurate display of the apple's internal structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image contain a top view that clearly displays the apple's stem structure and calyx area?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), one segment of the collage displays a top-down view of the apple. This view focuses on the stem structure and calyx area, capturing the central positioning of the stem and the circular spread of the calyx with distinctive red and lighter shades around it. This clearly presents the apple's top view in detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the current front view of the apple remained unchanged compared to the original image?",
    "explanation": "In the original image (Image A), the apple is presented without any other views or perspectives. In the edited image (Image B), although the apple is presented from multiple perspectives due to the collage format, one of the perspectives does resemble the original front view with a similar positioning and lighting effect. However, given the inclusion of multiple images presenting different angles and aspects, it suggests an addition rather than a change, maintaining the front view. Therefore, the fundamental features of the front view seen in the original remain consistent in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cross-section of the apple reveal both the flesh texture and seeds accurately?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the cross-section view shows intricate details of the apple's interior. The white, smooth flesh texture and the small, dark brown seeds near the center are displayed clearly. This detailed representation of the cross-section reveals both the flesh texture and the positioning of the seeds accurately. The realistic depiction aligns with typical apple anatomy, allowing for a precise understanding of its internal structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
