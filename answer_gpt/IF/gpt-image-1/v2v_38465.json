      "question": "Are the surfers replaced with pandas holding surfboards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of the two humans seen in Image A are replaced with pandas. The visual cues such as the black and white fur and distinctive panda ears are indicators of this change, leading to the conclusion that pandas are now positioned where the surfers were in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sunset and beach setting kept intact without any changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as the sunset sky, ocean, and beach appear identical to those in Image A. There are no visible changes or alterations in these elements. This conclusion is drawn by observing the continuity in the colors and layout of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original surfers, facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the pandas mimics the exact stance and orientation of the surfers from Image A. Both the pandas and the original surfers are seen standing with backs facing the camera, looking towards the sunset, which confirms the similarity in positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pandas holding surfboards in their paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each panda is holding a surfboard, much like the original surfers held in Image A. The surfboards rest against the pandas' sides with their paws gripping them, paralleling the manner in which the humans held the boards in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboards have the same color scheme—one yellow and one with a red, teal, and orange pattern—as observed in Image A. This analysis indicates no change in the design or colors of the surfboards between the images.",
