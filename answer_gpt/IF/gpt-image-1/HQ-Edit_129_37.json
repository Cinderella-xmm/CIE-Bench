        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a bottle-shaped object with a round body, distinct neck, and cap. The visual cues suggest a transformation from a typical compass to an object resembling a bottle, which has these features. The presence of a spray mechanism further supports that it is a bottle-shaped object.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B reveals that there is a metal spray nozzle at the top of the object where typically a needle might have rested in a compass. This suggests that the compass's function has been repurposed into a spray mechanism.",
