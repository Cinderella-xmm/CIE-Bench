      "question": "Does the image include a depiction of the dog from its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dog depicted from its left side. This is evident because one of the dogs is facing left, showing the left side of its body, which includes the left ear, left eye, and left side of the nose. The dog's body is positioned in such a way that it indicates a left-side view, common in illustrations to give a sense of orientation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog illustrated from its back view within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the depictions of the dog is indeed from its back view. You can tell this by observing the symmetrical positioning of the dog's ears, the orientation of the tail, and the visible rear end. This depiction excludes facial features, which are typical indications of a back view.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the left side and back views of the dog combined into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two separate depictions of the dog: one showing the left side and another showing the back view. They are not combined into one single depiction but are instead displayed side by side in the same image. Each depiction individually highlights different angles of the dog.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the left side and back views of the dog are depicted with the dog positioned on the bed. The bed is consistent, and in both perspectives, the dog's body is placed on it, showing continuity in both angles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depictions of the bed and bedsheet are consistent across both the left side and back views of the dog. The same bed structure and green bedsheet are visible in both views, ensuring coherence and continuity in the illustration.",
