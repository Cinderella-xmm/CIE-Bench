      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a hand-painted watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues, such as the soft blending of colors, brush stroke textures, and overall impressionistic rendering of objects and figures, suggest a hand-painted watercolor style. This is characteristic of watercolor paintings, where colors are often layered translucently and details are subtly suggested rather than sharply defined.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the foreground woman depicted in greater detail compared to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground woman shows more refined brushwork, with noticeable textures on her dress and more defined contours on her hand and wine glass compared to the background figures. This suggests that the artist focused more on rendering details for the subject in the foreground, common in compositions where the main subject is emphasized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background figures represented with light-colored linework and faint washes rather than detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background figures in Image B are painted with subdued colors and less distinct lines, creating an impressionistic effect. This suggests the use of faint watercolor washes, a technique often used to keep background elements unobtrusive, allowing the main subject to stand out more clearly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman appear to be elegantly raising her glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is holding a glass with an upright posture, and the positioning of her hand and glass suggest the motion of raising or toasting, which is typically associated with elegance in social contexts where wine is consumed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition structured so that the foreground woman is the central point of attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's prominent placement in the foreground, along with her detailed depiction and the use of contrasting colors compared to the background, directs the viewer's attention towards her. This composition technique is commonly employed to establish the main subject as the focal point of an artwork.",
