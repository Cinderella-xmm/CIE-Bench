      "question": "Does the edited image combine the front and right-side views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two cats positioned side by side, both oriented toward the front with a slight angle that provides a hint of a side profile. This setup creates a visual where each cat's face is angled slightly, offering a combination of direct front-facing and slight side views. This arrangement reflects visual design aiming to show multiple angles in a single composition, hence combining front and side views.",

      "question": "Are the cat's facial features clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both cats have their facial features sharply rendered, with clear visibility of their eyes, nose, and whiskers. The lighting accentuates the facial details, ensuring that critical features such as the fur texture around the face are discernible. This clarity in visual representation confirms prominent visibility of facial features.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat's body structure properly showcased in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two cats seated in a relaxed, natural position, displaying their body shape and posture effectively. The fur texture is distinctly visible, especially surrounding their bodies and tails. This appropriate showcasing allows an observer to identify the cats' compositional form and body outline without obstruction.",

      "question": "Has the original color, size, and position of the cat been preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image A and Image B, it appears that the cats are of similar coloration, size, and are positioned similarly in terms of resting on the same quilted surface. Although Image B includes two cats, the consistency in color and the physical structure do not divert significantly from the original representation in Image A, indicating preservation of these attributes.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition free from distortion and inconsistency in integrating both views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B achieves a harmonious composition by arranging two cats side by side without noticeable distortions or inconsistencies. Each cat is clearly defined, the integration appears natural, and both cats maintain similar visual proportions. The lighting and angles provide a seamless blend, leading to an unfragmented view despite combining views of two cats.",
