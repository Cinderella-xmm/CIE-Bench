    "Question": "Q1: Is the mirror still present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the space that was previously occupied by the mirror is now occupied by an art piece. This indicates that the mirror is no longer present in the image. My judgment is based on observing an absence of reflective surfaces where the mirror was originally located.",

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the minimalist landscape wall art appear to have a fabric canvas material texture?",
