      "question": "Is the couple depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated facial features and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the couple in a stylized cartoon format that often includes exaggerated features or proportions typical of caricatures or chibi art styles. This style is evident in the simplified, animated representation of the couple's attire and posture. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common artistic styles, it's reasonable to conclude the couple is indeed depicted in a cartoon style.",

      "question": "Has the beadwork on the bride’s gown been enhanced to appear more elaborate or exaggerated than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic depiction of the bride's gown includes simplified and stylized beadwork as part of the cartoon illustration. The beadwork and embellishments appear evenly distributed and stylistically exaggerated, a common technique in cartoon art to highlight details without adhering strictly to realistic proportions or distributions.",

      "question": "Has the groom’s suit lapel been enlarged to an exaggerated size compared to its original proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the groom in a cartoon style where parts of the clothing can be exaggerated. The suit lapel, while having an altered appearance due to the stylistic change, does not appear significantly enlarged beyond the typical proportions seen in cartoons. This artistic representation keeps proportions fairly balanced relative to the rest of the suit.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
