      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual inspection shows a wooden round table with a cup of coffee, a glass of water, and a small glass with sugar under bright sunlight, suggesting a different setting compared to an indoor table with a phone stand. The phone and stand are not visible in the edited image, suggesting they have been completely removed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a round wooden table set outdoors with a cup of coffee, a glass of water, and other café-related items, positioned near a body of water under sunlight. This setup is indicative of a typical seaside café setting. There is no mention of such a scene in Image A, which features a phone stand, suggesting that the tabletop scene has indeed been replaced.",

      "question": "Are there visible sunlight and sea wave reflections on the tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light reflections are visible on the water surface in the background, which is characteristic of sunlight reflecting off waves. This creates a bright, sparkling effect often seen near seaside areas under clear skies. The table itself is also well-lit, consistent with being in direct sunlight. Therefore, the image depicts sunlight and reflections as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a wooden table arrayed with a cup of coffee, a glass of water, and a sugar glass. Additionally, the presence of a wooden chair and the backdrop of a visible seascape and sunlight reinforce the ambiance associated with a seaside café. These elements are typical of such environments, contributing to the suitable atmospheric setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B displays a consistent perspective with a typical café table setup. The items such as the cup of coffee and glasses are logically placed and cast natural shadows under the sunlight, imparting a realistic impression of the seaside café context. The background supports this theme with its scenery and light conditions, completing the realistic composition.",
