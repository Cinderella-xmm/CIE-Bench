      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration on the packaging in Image B depicts the food processor from a viewpoint where multiple sides of it can be seen, giving it a slightly three-dimensional perspective. This is characteristic of an isometric angle, where the object is rendered in a way that all axes are equally foreshortened, creating a sense of depth and spatial placement.",

      "explanation": "Image B includes additional illustrations beside the image of the food processor which suggest different parts of the item separately drawn around it, possibly indicating an exploded view. This visual style is commonly used to show how parts fit together, aiding understanding of the productâ€™s components.",
