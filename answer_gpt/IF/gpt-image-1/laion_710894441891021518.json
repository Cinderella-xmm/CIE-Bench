      "explanation": "Image B depicts the plant situated in what appears to be a stone base rather than the original plain pot.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trunk of the form retains the texture of tree bark but has been reshaped to suggest the form of flowing fabric. This gives a visual impression akin to robes or garments, which is often a stylistic choice in fantasy illustrations to give plant-based creatures a more humanoid and regal appearance.",
