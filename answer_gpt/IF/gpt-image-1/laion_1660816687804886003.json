    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the object now shaped like a modern energy drink can instead of a sneaker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe the object is cylindrical and has standard proportions of an energy drink can. The design elements are applied on a surface that evidently resembles a can typically used for beverages. The lack of defining sneaker elements such as soles or an overall shoe shape further supports this observation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the can feature the navy blue mesh pattern from the original sneaker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a pattern on the surface of the can which closely resembles the navy blue mesh seen on sneakers, indicative of the pattern texture used on sports shoes for breathability. This detail has been applied as part of the visual design of the can.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo (circular emblem with red and blue sections) visible on the front of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays a circular emblem with a recognizable color scheme of red and blue, similar to generic brand logos. Positioned clearly on the front of the can tells us it mimics the branding style often seen on product packaging.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bold laces represented as embossed or raised textures wrapped around the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design incorporates bold laces which appear to be part of the texture wrapping around the can. They are rendered as if they are embossed or raised on the surface, a creative adaptation of sneaker elements into the can design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the three navy blue stripes from the sole appear as a dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features three navy stripes at the bottom half of the can, reminiscent of classic shoe designs where such stripe patterns are used for accentuating brand identity. This positioning and styling reflect a direct adaptation from the sole of a sneaker.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" written in red lettering on the white upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'Kickstart' is clearly visible on the front in red letters, but it is not on the white upper portion; instead, it is positioned more centrally on the navy patterned section. This observation reveals a creative placement within the design schema.",
