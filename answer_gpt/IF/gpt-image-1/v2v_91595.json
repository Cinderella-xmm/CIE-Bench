      "question": "Does the lens mount area feature a large, intricate mechanical eye with glowing amber irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens mount area is clearly visible as a large, intricate mechanical eye. The design incorporates a glowing amber iris, resembling detailed mechanical components. The visual cues from the intricate design and the color of the iris indicate an intentional resemblance to a mechanical eye, suggesting an artistic transformation in the image.",

      "question": "Are there delicate articulated copper feathers sprouting from the textured black casing of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays what appears to be copper feathers extending from the camera body. These feathers have an articulated appearance, which suggests a thoughtful incorporation of mechanical design elements. The contrast between the metallic feathers and the textured black casing of the camera provides a clear visual transformation.",

      "question": "Does the open battery compartment reveal a complex array of tiny, whirring gears and springs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open battery compartment reveals a detailed arrangement of tiny gears and springs. This mechanical complexity deviates from the standard battery compartment contents seen in traditional cameras. The visible elements suggest a transformation to a more intricate mechanical setup, akin to the inner workings of a clock.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the new elements, such as the mechanical eye, copper feathers, and gears, appear seamlessly integrated with the camera's original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical eye, copper feathers, and gears in Image B appear carefully integrated into the camera's structure, creating a cohesive design. This integration gives the impression that these elements are not just add-ons, but part of a merged camera-artistic piece. The attention to detail and blending suggest an intentional and seamless transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate elements suggestive of a majestic clockwork owl, melded with the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates elements that heavily suggest a transformation into a clockwork owl. The intricate mechanical eye resembles owl features, the copper feathers mimic an owl's plumage, and the detailed clockwork gears provide additional owl-like characteristics. These aspects collectively give the image an owl-driven aesthetic, integrated with the camera.",
