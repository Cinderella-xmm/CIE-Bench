      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky is depicted with characteristics typical of a plush toy, such as simplified and stylized features, a soft and rounded structure, and uniform color shading often seen in stuffed toys. The eyes are cartoonishly large and lack the detailed texture found in real eyes. These elements, combined with the smooth fabric-like texture, suggest that the husky is indeed a stuffed toy rather than a live animal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the husky's paws as rounded, overly large, and cartoonish, which is a common design choice for plush toys to increase their cuteness and appeal. This proportion is not realistic when compared to a real husky's paws, which are more proportionate to their body size and less exaggerated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall texture of the husky in Image B appears smooth and velvety, lacking the individual hair strands and realistic fur texture present in live animals. This smoothness is a key characteristic of plush toys, which typically use a uniform fabric material for their outer layer to simulate fur.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky's facial features, such as the eyes, are represented in a cartoonish and embroidered style, typical of plush toys. The eyes lack the depth and detail of a realistic animal's eyes, indicating a fabric's stitched or printed representation rather than realistic features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base upon which the plush husky sits appears to be a flat, clean, and plain surface resembling a wooden shelf. The lack of additional detailing or context suggests it simulates a shelf commonly used for displaying items like plush toys.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background minimalist, without any natural elements like snow, trees, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a minimalist background with a plain, neutral color, devoid of any natural elements typical of an outdoor scene such as snow, trees, or sky. This composition is often chosen for indoor product photography or display purposes to draw focus to the subject itself.",
