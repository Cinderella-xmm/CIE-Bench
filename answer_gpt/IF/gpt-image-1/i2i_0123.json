      "question": "Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left parking meter displays an illustration of a robotic dog where the timer or dial is typically located. This is evident from the visual cue of the dog with robotic features, replacing the area where an analog timer is usually found. Based on the visual cues, the timer has indeed been replaced by the robotic dog illustration.",

      "question": "Is the robotic dog clearly shown holding a coin in its paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robotic dog in Image B is shown holding a coin with its right paw. This is visible due to the clear portrayal of the dog with a coin held in one of its paws, which is a distinct visual element in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the parking meter still display billing information such as numbers and labels in a legible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the addition of the robotic dog illustration, the parking meter in Image B continues to display numbers and labels, including the device number, time remaining, and operational notices. These details are clear and legible, indicating that billing information is still visible.",

      "question": "Has the overall shape and structure of the parking meter remained consistent with the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparison, both Image A (original) and Image B (edited) maintain the same overall shape and structure of the parking meters. The modifications in Image B are primarily decorative, with the addition of the robotic dog illustration, but the fundamental structure and design remain unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration of the dog in Image B is characterized by features that suggest a robotic design, including metallic textures and elements that resemble mechanical parts. These visual cues are indicative of a robot, making the dog identifiable as such.",
