    "Question": "Q1: Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to emerge from a flat surface like a television screen and shows only the upper half of the body. This depiction suggests a 3D effect limited to the upper body, fitting the description of a 3D half-body figure. The attention to detail in the character's armor and shield and the visible upper torso area supports this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is visually positioned so that it seems to be emerging from the frame of a television screen. The spatial arrangement and the angle at which the character is depicted suggest a 'breaking out' effect. Given that the character's arm and shield extend forward past the edge of the TV screen, the visual cues successfully create the illusion that the character is exiting the confines of the screen into the viewer's space.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character holds a shield, which faces forward and is positioned as if to block or defend against an incoming force. The arm position, with the shield slightly raised and in front of the body, indicates a defensive posture typically used in both combat and protective stances.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image simulate an augmented reality display effect through lighting, shadows, and spatial realism?",
    "explanation": "Image B successfully creates the illusion of a 3D figure popping out of the screen, which is characteristic of augmented reality effects. The lighting and shadows are consistent with spatial realism, providing depth and a sense of physical presence and interaction with the real environment, in this case, the scene of emerging from the television.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the character's original appearance and posture been maintained while implementing the new effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character's appearance, including costume details and overall posture, remains consistent with the typical depiction of the character despite the addition of the augmented reality simulation. The details of the costume and the defensive pose are clearly preserved. Only spatial and visual elements are altered to achieve the 'breaking out' effect without changing the character's original stance or appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
