      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure with transparent, faceted surfaces, indicating a geometric crystal appearance. This contrasts with the log cabin seen in Image A, which is characterized by its wooden logs and traditional construction. The transition from a wooden structure to a crystal-like facade supports the conclusion that the log cabin has been replaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces are visibly transparent and faceted, characterized by reflections or refractions of blue and green hues. These visual characteristics contrast with the solid, opaque wooden construction seen in Image A. The prismatic effect seen in Image B supports the presence of such hues.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates that beams and supports are now crystal-like with multifaceted edges, contrasting with Image A's wooden beams. The seamless transformation from wood to crystal structure supports the replacement of wooden elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is visible as a flat, white surface resembling marble, distinct from the natural ground seen in Image A. This observation and distinction confirm that the structure rests on a marble platform.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small crystal formations present as decorative accents along the base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small crystal formations along the base, serving as decorative accents. These are absent in Image A, which has no such formations. This transformation introduces decorative crystal elements.",
