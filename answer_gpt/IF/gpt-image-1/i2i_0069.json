      "question": "Is there a holographic projection screen added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a glowing, blue, transparent screen with design elements that resemble a digital interface indicates a holographic projection screen. The color, transparency, and digital interface features are common in representations of holograms. These visual cues suggest the intentional addition of such a screen.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection appear to emerge from the man's phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic screen visually connects to the phone held by the man, with its base seemingly positioned near or on the phone's surface. The position and alignment suggest that the screen is emanating directly from the phone, a concept commonly depicted in representations of technology and holographic displays.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen display a city map interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's holographic screen features lines and shapes, including locations marked with coordinates, resembling street layouts often found on city maps. The presence of these geographic and navigational elements on the screen indicates that it likely displays a map interface, specifically a city map.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the holographic projection screen designed in a futuristic and transparent style characteristic of sci-fi elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The screen in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of sci-fi representations: it is transparent, glows with a blue hue, and has an intricate digital interface projected above the phone. These elements are associated with futuristic sci-fi designs, enhancing the impression of advanced technological aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A depicts a similar setting with a sandwich and table setting, but lacks the holographic screen. Image B retains the essential elements like the sandwich and knife, consistent with Image A, except for the addition of a holographic screen. No other major changes outside the specific addition of the screen appear in Image B.",
