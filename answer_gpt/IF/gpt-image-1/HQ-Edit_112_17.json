        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools have a distinct appearance with shiny and polished enamel surfaces.

      "question": "Is the hammer handle rendered in deep blue enamel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer handle features a vibrant deep blue color with the glossy shine typical of enamel. This contrasts with Image A, where the hammer has a wooden handle. The blue enamel with ornamental details is a significant change from the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer head appears to have a glossy finish, reflecting light in a manner indicative of polished metal. This finish gives it a refined appearance as opposed to the more rustic look of the original rustic hammer head in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows curls that have a smooth and uniform texture. They are colored in shades of amber and ivory which don't resemble raw wood. Instead, they look like crafted elements, suggesting replacement with enamel curls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools are placed on a surface with visible weave patterns, resembling linen fabric. This is a departure from the wooden surface in Image A, providing a more sophisticated backdrop for the enamel tools.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric surface visually complement the polished appearance of the enamel tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textured fabric surface in Image B provides a neutral and contrasting background that enhances the metallic and colorful enamel surfaces of the tools. This combination is visually pleasing and complements the intricate details, as the subtle fabric pattern doesn't compete with the enamel's visual appeal.",
