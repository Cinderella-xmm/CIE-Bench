    "Question": "Q1: Are the train cars depicted as large, colorful, interlocking blocks rather than realistic carriages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train cars are designed as cartoonish, colorful blocks interlocking with each other, resembling toy building blocks. This is visually distinct from realistic train carriages, which would typically have detailed windows, doors, and a streamlined structure. This block-like appearance is more abstract and playful, which is consistent with a non-realistic representation.",
