      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the title at the top reads 'Balanced Lunch', not 'Today’s Balanced Lunch'. The absence of the word 'Today’s' means this is not the exact wording specified in the question.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the colors of the food and the background are very bright and vivid. The orange background and the colors in the salad, orange slices, and bread are more intense compared to the original dull appearance one would expect without enhancement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), each food item on the plate has a clear white outline surrounding it. This is noticeable around the edges of the salad, orange slices, bread, and even the milk carton, creating a separated appearance against the dish and background.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) has a square shape, resembling a social media post format rather than an A4 vertical layout. The text and images are centered and there's available space on the top for the title and the bottom for a logo placeholder, which does not reflect typical A4 vertical formatting.",
