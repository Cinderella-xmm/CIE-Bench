      "question": "Is the police car fully constructed from LEGO bricks, with no realistic or photographic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the police car is depicted using LEGO bricks, as evidenced by the discernible interlocking patterns typical of LEGO pieces, and the stylized blocky elements such as the roof, body, and wheels. It lacks realistic features or photographic elements, which would be characterized by smooth and continuous surfaces. This conclusion is derived from the uniform texture and appearance, which resembles a standard LEGO model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body panels of the car primarily composed of blue and black LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the police car's body panels are predominantly constructed with blue LEGO bricks, and the bumpers and detailing around the lower portion of the vehicle use black LEGO bricks. This is evidenced by the clear separation of sections with distinct blue and black colored LEGO bricks that align with the design conventions of LEGO models representing vehicles.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the emergency lights on top and the front headlights made from red and blue translucent LEGO pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows emergency lights made from translucent LEGO pieces, with clear red and blue colors on top, mimicking the look of real police car lights. The matching color and transparency is indicative of LEGO design pieces used for lighting, differentiating from opaque bricks due to their material property, which LEGO does use for realistic detail enhancement.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the windows of the car constructed from beige LEGO bricks instead of transparent or clear pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the windows of the LEGO model appear to be constructed using beige LEGO bricks, which simulates the window frames, rather than using transparent or clear pieces typical for glass representations in LEGO models. This choice of beige bricks is visible and matches the aesthetic approach often seen in LEGO vehicle designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grille and wheels constructed from small LEGO blocks showing detailed brickwork and modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the grille and wheels are constructed using smaller LEGO blocks, which showcase detailed brickwork and a modular structure. The design is consistent with LEGO's construction method for creating intricate features like grilles and wheels through multiple interconnected pieces to replicate essential details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the LEGO car positioned on a plain matte gray surface with no additional textures, patterns, or background details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indicates that the LEGO car is indeed placed on a plain matte gray surface. This can be observed through the uniform coloration and lack of any additional textures or patterns, which suggests a focus on highlighting the car without external distractions, typical for product showcase or portfolio images of LEGO models.",
