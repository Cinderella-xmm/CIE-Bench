      "question": "Is the entire image composed of small, distinct mosaic tiles with visible grout lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual appearance clearly shows a pattern resembling small, distinct mosaic tiles with grout lines visible between them. The mosaic pattern is evenly distributed across the image, covering all the elements such as the background and the characters, indicating that the entire image is indeed created using this style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vivid and saturated, particularly the red heart balloon and the child's features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the colors appear rich and saturated. The red balloon and the heart are bright and vibrant, contrasting sharply against the blue and yellow background. This shows an intentional use of vivid and saturated colors.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the heart balloon and the child clearly defined and emphasized in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the heart balloon and the child are distinct and emphasized by using darker tiles or grout lines. This creates a strong contrast and clear definition typical of mosaic art, helping to maintain the shape and form of these elements.",

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing the analysis of Image A and Image B, all essential elements, such as the child, the balloon, and the heart figure, are present in both images and positioned similarly. The overall composition remains intact despite the change in artistic style from a painted mural to a mosaic.",

      "question": "Does the material of the artwork reflect the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles, such as a glossy or matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual texture suggests characteristics typical of ceramic mosaic tiles. While individual tiles arenâ€™t glossy, the overall matte finish, with the tangible texture implied by the grout lines and color, mirrors the qualities found in physical ceramic mosaic artworks.",
