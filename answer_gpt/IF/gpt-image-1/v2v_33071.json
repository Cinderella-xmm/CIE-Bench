      "question": "Has snow been added to the clock tower and the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show the clock tower covered in snow, indicating a winter setting. The snow is visibly accumulated on various parts of the tower, such as the roof and ledges. This is combined with typical winter imagery, enhancing the snowy appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the flags been replaced with icy patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows flags with a snowflake or icy pattern rather than the original stripes that are typical flags, hinting at an intended winter theme. This change reflects the prevalent winter elements in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the overall scene reflect a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, has snow covering and accumulation, altered flag patterns with snowflake designs, and a muted color palette typical of winter scenery. The visual cues suggest a comprehensive transformation to a winter scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, snow is visibly built up along the roof edges and other features of the clock tower. Accumulation is portrayed consistently, emphasizing the wintry conditions, typically seen in snowy environments.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows flags with an icy, snowflake design, differing markedly from the striped flag pattern in Image A. This deliberate change underlines the focus on a winter theme, contrasting the original summer imagery.",
