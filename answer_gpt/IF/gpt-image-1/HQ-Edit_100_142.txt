    "Question": "Q6: Are the grass and trees in the background stylized with flowing or angular forms that visually mirror the rhythmic motion of the drummer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the grass and trees do not visually mirror the rhythmic motion of the drummer in a clear, analogous manner, their forms are stylized and integrated into the overall flow and texture of the painting, suggesting motion through their impressionistic rendering, though not specifically reflecting drumming rhythms.",
