      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the woman is positioned in a typical Ancient Egyptian art style where the body is shown from the side (profile), but the eyes are large and face forward.

      "explanation": "The boxing gloves in the second image maintain a similar form and color to those in the first image but appear more integrated with the overall Ancient Egyptian aesthetic of the artwork.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the palm leaves in the background are depicted in a stylized manner reflective of traditional Egyptian art. The presence of a border resembling Egyptian hieroglyphic art and the depicted texture that mimics sandstone suggests a deliberate effort to replicate an authentic Egyptian scene. This evokes the aesthetic of sacred flora as might be found within historical compositions.",
