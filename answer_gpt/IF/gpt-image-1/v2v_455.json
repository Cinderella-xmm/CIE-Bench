        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sticker has a visible background pattern with blue and white designs suggesting snow and trees, but the area outside these illustrations is transparent, allowing for a clear sticker shape to show through. This transparency allows them to be placed on various surfaces without obstructing the view or leaving a visible background color. Considering these observations, the background is transparent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the stickers vary somewhat in shape due to their design, with some extending vertically or horizontally depending on the action or pose shown. While they fit within a square boundary, the designs themselves are not a perfect square in every instance. Therefore, not all stickers maintain a strict square aspect ratio of 1:1.",

      "explanation": "The stickers display an adorable, exaggerated style typical of chibi art, characterized by large heads and small bodies. The color scheme is vibrant, with bright oranges and blues, creating a lively and appealing visual impact. However, Chibi art is not specifically limited to Ghibli; it is a broader style significant to various Japanese cartoon aesthetics. These aspects highlight the chibi cartoon aesthetic.",
