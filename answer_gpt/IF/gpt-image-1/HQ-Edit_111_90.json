      "question": "Is the necklace and snake tail enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we clearly see the necklace and snake tail within what appears to be a glass dome. The transparent, bell-shaped covering visually encases the contents inside, indicating that the elements are enclosed. A glass dome is often used for protective display, serving to keep the items inside free from dust while allowing viewing. The visual cues support this understanding.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green snake-like tail seems to rise from an area covered in moss or a similar grass-like texture at the base. Moss is a commonly found element in natural settings, contributing to the organic feel of the display scene within the dome. The visual elements strongly suggest this arrangement.",
