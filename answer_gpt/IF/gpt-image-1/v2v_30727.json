      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a person present in the frame, positioned near the zebra, but not directly near the zebra's tail. The person is standing on the right side of the zebra, closer to the zebra's head rather than its tail. Analyzing the composition of the photo, the person's location does not directly correspond to a position near the zebra's tail. Thus, based on the visual information presented in the edited image, the person is not near the zebra's tail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted with its head directed towards the person rather than turned away. The zebra's gaze is fixed on the individual, suggesting it is aware of the person's presence. This indicates that the zebra's head is oriented towards the person, showing direct attention or possible interaction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is standing near the zebra, but the feet are positioned closer to the watering hole and not near the zebra's tail. Given the spatial arrangement, the person's feet do not seem close enough to be considered near or on the zebra's tail. The visual cues from the image convey that there is a clear distance between the person's feet and the zebra's tail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the key environmental elements such as the rocky terrain and the watering hole as seen in Image A. There are no significant alterations or removals that detract from the natural setting originally depicted. The foundational components of the environment remain consistent between the two images.",

      "question": "Does the zebra's expression and posture indicate it is startled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra exhibits an open mouth and alert posture, which are typical indicators of a startled or defensive state in animals. Its body is tense, and the attention is directed towards the person, signifying a reaction to an unexpected presence or disturbance. Thus, the zebra's expression and body language are consistent with it being startled.",
