      "question": "Are the industrial structures on the left rendered with thick, visible impasto brushstrokes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures exhibit thick and visible brushstrokes, emulating the impasto style often used in expressive painting techniques. This observation relies on recognizing the texture and layering typical of impasto, where paint is applied thickly. The visible brushstrokes suggest an artistic, painterly technique rather than a smooth photographic one.",
