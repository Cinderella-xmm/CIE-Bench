      "question": "Does the elephant’s skin feature a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B has a texture that resembles a galaxy, with visible star-like features and swirls that are reminiscent of cosmic structures like nebulae. The patterns on the skin clearly depict a cosmic theme, with elements that are not typically present on an elephant but align with celestial imagery.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant’s tusks exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance with glowing, cloud-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's tusks show a shiny texture with vibrant, luminous colors that suggest a nebula-like appearance. The tusks have a cloud-like texture that mimics cosmic imagery, aligning with the nebula characteristics described in the question.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the elephant’s ears replaced with vast, sail-like structures that reflect starry constellations and have a celestial appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the elephant's ears in Image B display a starry or cosmic pattern, they still retain the natural shape typical of an elephant's ears and are not replaced with sail-like structures. The ears reflect a celestial theme, but their structure remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the elephant’s trunk emit a visible, swirling cosmic mist composed of glowing particles or nebula-like vapor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trunk in Image B has a visible mist-like effect swirling around it, which resembles cosmic phenomena like nebulas, composed of what appear to be glowing particles. This aligns with the description of a cosmic mist.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed luminous rings closely resembling planetary orbits encircling the elephant's legs, adding a celestial appearance to the overall visual theme of the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the elephant do show luminescent patterns that resemble stars. The glowing effect is evident and distinct against the cosmic-themed skin, contributing to the overall galactic motif.",
