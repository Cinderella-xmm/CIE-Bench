      "question": "Are the surfaces of the castle composed of visible wooden puzzle pieces with natural oak and mahogany coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the castle are clearly made of wooden pieces that resemble puzzle pieces. The colors visible in the image are consistent with natural wood tones, particularly oak and mahogany, which often display light to medium brown shades. This can be deduced from the distinct interlocking patterns and the dual-toned wood appearance typical of such wood types.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The castle in Image B displays a consistent architectural structure with two prominent towers, an arched entrance in the center, multiple windows, and walls connecting the towers.

      "question": "Do the tops of both towers display detailed interlocking puzzle piece patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of both towers include detailed patterns that resemble interlocking puzzle pieces. This is evident from the defined edges and interlocking shapes at the top of each tower, which is characteristic of puzzle designs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a base that appears to be a smooth and flat wooden tabletop. The uniform texture and color beneath the castle indicate a deliberate placement on a wooden surface, distinct from natural ground or other materials.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle is constructed from components that are visibly segmented to resemble individual puzzle pieces. The defined edges and clear joints between each piece suggest a puzzle-like construction.",
