      "question": "Is the image formatted as a magazine cover with a clear layout resembling a vintage sports publication?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes design elements typical of a magazine cover: a prominent title 'FOOTY LEGENDS,' positioned at the bottom in large text, resembling a magazine layout. Moreover, additional headlines at the top reinforce the appearance of a publication cover. The overall design, including layout and color scheme, mimics the aesthetic of vintage sports publications.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is a visible textured grain overlay applied uniformly across the image to simulate a vintage print effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a uniform textured grain effect visible across its entirety, including the background and player details. This texture is akin to effects used in vintage print media to replicate aged or historic prints, enhancing the retro character of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the reds (e.g., jersey stripes, socks) and greens (e.g., field) significantly more vibrant and saturated than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the colors are notably muted and incorporate a yellow-beige tone consistent with the vintage theme. Comparison with Image A reveals more vibrant coloring. Common design practices for vintage filters involve muting colors rather than enhancing saturation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the headlines '1962 Champions' and 'Inside: The Game Changers' present at the top of the image in readable text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains legible headlines at the top reading 'Inside: The Game Changers.' There is no headline mentioning '1962 Champions.' The presence of only one headline in readable text indicates a partial fulfillment of the query. Therefore, not all specified text appears in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the houses and trees in the background been reduced to simple, dark silhouettes without detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the background maintaining detailed elements, including visible architecture and distinct tree shapes, rather than reducing them to simple silhouettes. This maintains complexity rather than simplified silhouettes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text 'FOOTY LEGENDS' displayed in large uppercase letters across the bottom of the image using a bold serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays 'FOOTY LEGENDS' prominently at the bottom in large uppercase letters using a bold serif font. The design choice, characterized by the font style and text positioning, is typical for conveying emphasis in titles and complements the vintage aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all textual elements (headlines and main title) rendered in a bold serif font style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines font styles: the main title ‘FOOTY LEGENDS’ appears in a bold serif font, while the headline at the top 'Inside: The Game Changers' seems to be rendered in a sans-serif font. Thus, not all text elements use the same bold serif style.",
      "weight": 1,
