      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Michelin-style plating often involves artistic and precise arrangement of food elements. In Image B, the steak is intricately arranged in a spiral pattern, with precise, aesthetically pleasing placement of sauce dots and fan-shaped carrot cuts, indicative of high-end plating often associated with Michelin standards.",

      "question": "Is the steak spiral-rolled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steak appears in a distinct spiral-rolled pattern. This formation is visually clear as the concentric circles are prominent and indicative of a rolled preparation method, often associated with gourmet presentation.",

      "question": "Are the carrots cut into a fan-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots in Image B are cut into a fan-like arrangement. This is evident by the overlapping slices that form a semi-circular, fan-like display, contributing to the plated dish's artistic layout.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, sauce dots are strategically placed on the plate but they do not directly accompany each vegetable. They are presented in a curved pattern leading away from the steak and not directly related to individual vegetables.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the food is served on a white ceramic plate, which appears spacious enough to display each element neatly. This large, minimalist plate is typical for refined dining settings.",
