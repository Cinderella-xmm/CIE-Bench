    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit a 3D style with depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the visual presentation uses elements such as the kitten's paws extending beyond the boundaries of the monitor screen, creating an illusion that the kitten is protruding from the screen. This technique is a common methodology in imagery to simulate a 3D effect, thus providing depth perception.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the kitten as actively jumping out of the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the kitten's front paws extending outwards and beyond the frame of the screen, which gives the appearance of movement and suggests action consistent with jumping out. This is a clever use of imagery and digital manipulation to portray an action, even though it's a static image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 3D effect in the image achieved without requiring special glasses or external devices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image employs digital alterations to create a depth effect by playing with perspective and boundaries without necessitating any external supplementation like 3D glasses. This technique allows viewers to perceive the intended effect directly by just viewing the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the kitten's original appearance, including color and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the parts of the kitten that can be observed, including its paws and ears, it appears that the edit did not alter the kittenâ€™s color or texture. The orange fur with distinct patterns and the visual quality seems consistent with the original, maintaining its appearance despite the changes to the image format.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's features still clearly visible and not obscured by the 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main features of the kitten such as its paws and ears are clearly visible in the image, unimpeded by the 3D effects aimed to depict it jumping out. These visual modifications have not obscured these specific character traits of the kitten.",
