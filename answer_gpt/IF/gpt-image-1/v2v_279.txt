    "Question": "Q1: Has the bird been converted into a 3D chibi-style model?",
    "explanation": "To answer this question, we observe Image B, where the bird appears rounded and stylized with exaggerated features, such as large eyes typical of chibi styles, giving it a playful and cute appearance. This contrasts with Image A, where the bird is depicted realistically. Hence, this transformation indicates a conversion into a 3D chibi-style model.",

    "Question": "Q2: Has the lemur been converted into a 3D chibi-style model?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lemur shows characteristics typical of 3D chibi models, such as simplified shapes and larger eyes, resembling an animated or playful style. Image A depicts the lemur more realistically, without these stylized features. The presence of these styling changes suggests that the lemur has indeed been converted into a 3D chibi-style model.",

    "Question": "Q3: Have the other characters in the scene been converted into 3D chibi-style models?",
