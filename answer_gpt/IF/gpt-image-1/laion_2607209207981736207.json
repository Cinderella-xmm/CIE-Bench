      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original scanner completely replaced by a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner has been depicted on a box showcasing futuristic packaging design. The image is centered around the box, which features graphics of the scanner. The key focus is the box design itself, which completely replaces the three-dimensional physical form of the scanner seen in Image A. The visualization of the scanner is printed on the packaging, not the scanner itself, indicating that the scanner is not depicted as a separate object outside the packaging in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the packaging feature visible metallic textures such as brushed metal, chrome, or reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the packaging shows a digital and sleek design but does not exhibit any of the specific characteristics of metallic textures, such as brushed metal or chrome finish. The surface appears smooth with a graphic design that suggests a digital theme rather than a metallic one.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging exhibit an iridescent color effect with shifting hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are consistent with a digital and sleek design. While there are shades of blue and black, there isn't an indication of an iridescent effect where colors shift based on the viewing angle. Therefore, it lacks the characteristic color-changing effect of iridescence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a holographic display on the front of the packaging showing the scanner in operation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging design in Image B includes a printed graphic that represents the scanner with a digital look on its box. However, there is no holographic display on the packaging; instead, it shows a designed image resembling a scanner in action, but it's not a true holographic display. Holography typically implies a 3D effect visible from multiple angles, which is not present here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible grid lines or circuit-like patterns across the surface of the packaging that resemble data flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging design clearly features grid lines reminiscent of high-tech themes. These grid patterns often hint at digital, data-driven aesthetics, creating an impression of data flow or circuit-like designs, which aligns with the futuristic theme shown on the box.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there tech-themed icons (e.g., circuits, data streams, digital symbols) and modern branding elements visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a modern packaging design that includes tech-themed icons such as a power button and digital symbols, combined with branding elements like the 'Futuristic Scanner' text and the tech company logo. These elements emphasize a modern, high-tech aesthetic that aligns with futuristic products.",
