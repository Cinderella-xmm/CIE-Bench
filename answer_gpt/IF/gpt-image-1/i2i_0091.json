      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the environment shows a castle hall with stone walls and gothic arches. There is no wall clock visible, as the architectural style and interior are significantly different from the modern setting in the original image.",

      ],

        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image displays a modern interior with lighting casting clear shadows on a flat wall. The edited image has a warm, diffused light coming through large arched windows, creating shadows across the stone floor and highlighting the vertical patterns. The lighting styles are markedly different due to the architectural and material differences.",
