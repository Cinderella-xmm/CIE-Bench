      "question": "Has the woven texture of the handbag been replaced with a scaly pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the bag is visibly different from typical woven patterns; instead, it shows a series of overlapping shapes resembling fish or reptile scales. This is a clear visual indicator combined with common knowledge of what scales look like. The pattern is uniform and covers the entire surface of the bag, reflecting a scaly appearance rather than the original woven look.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements that correspond to the location of gray ribbons in Image A have been reshaped and expanded.

This transformation from a flat bow shape to a more intricate wing design is evident through their positioning and curvature.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the areas previously occupied by white flowers now support structures resembling eyes, with large circular centers typical of cartoon or animated eyes.
