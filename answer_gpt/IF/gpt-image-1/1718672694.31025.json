      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two towers of the castle now depicted as thick, upright tree trunks with visible, textured bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show large tree trunks with visible bark texture. There are no stone towers present, and the structure visually resembles trees rather than a castle. Common knowledge allows one to discern trees with their typical trunk shapes and bark patterns, suggesting that the towers have indeed been replaced by tree trunks with detailed bark textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the stone walls between the towers been replaced with large, spreading branches that extend outward from the tree trunks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an interconnected structure of tree branches extending outward from the main tree trunks. These visually take the place where stone walls would conventionally appear in a castle. The organic forms of branches are evident and distinct from stone textures, indicating replacement with a natural, arboreal structure typical of large branches.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flagpole and flag removed, and replaced with glowing, translucent green leaves that appear to float or flutter above the tree structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a presence of glowing green elements above the tree-like structure, resembling leaves or organic tendrils. These glowing forms replace the typical flagpole and flag setup seen on a castle, supporting the idea of replacement with an organic form. The lighting effect gives the impression of translucency and ethereal quality, akin to mystical leaves fluttering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ground-level plants and roots transformed into visible spirit-like figures, partially transparent and integrated into the root system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts figures at the base of the tree structure that appear spirit-like, with partial transparency and integration into the root system. They give a mystical impression, quite different from conventional roots or plants. Common understanding of ghostly imagery supports the notion of spirit figures being part of the organic root network.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire structure now resemble a living, ancient tree sentinel with organic forms replacing all stone elements, and does the scene have a mystical, glowing ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys a transformation from solid stone structures to entirely organic ones, with tree trunks, branches, spirit-like figures, and glowing elements present, forming a unified, ancient tree sentinel. The glowing elements contribute to an ambiance that is mystical and ethereal, far removed from the castle's original non-organic form. This portrayal matches the conception of a living, fantastic entity replacing the stone presence.",
