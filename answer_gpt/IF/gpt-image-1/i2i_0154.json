      "question": "Does the edited image contain the front view of the sports car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a drawing featuring multiple perspectives of a sports car. One of the views prominently displayed is the front view, which is discernible by observing the details like the car's grille, headlights, and general frontal contours, matching the typical characteristics of a sports car, which we recognize as resembling a Ford Mustang.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain the side view of the sports car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes multiple schematics of a sports car, one of which is a side view. This can be identified by the orientation showing a profile of the car, highlighting features like the car doors, wheels from a lateral perspective, and the roofline, which all contribute to the typical side view depiction of vehicles.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image also has a schematic showing the top view of a sports car, identifiable by viewing the roof, hood, and trunk from above. This view allows for assessment of the car's outline and spatial structure as seen from an aerial perspective.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual observation, Image B presents these three different views (front, side, and top) linearly arranged in a schematic illustration format. These views are clearly separate yet aligned diagrams of the same subject within a single illustration sheet, commonly used in technical drawings or design blueprints.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents three distinct perspectives of the sports car in a clean and precise manner. The lines and proportions appear accurate and the views are systematically organized, reflecting professional standards of technical illustration used in design, engineering, or educational contexts.",
