      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical or dome-shaped structure resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually presents an Eiffel Tower and a cityscape inside a transparent spherical structure with snow-like particles suspended in it. This matches the characteristic appearance of a snow globe. My knowledge of snow globes—typically decorative items with scenes encased in clear domes—aligns with this presentation. Therefore, the scene does indeed appear enclosed within a snow globe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the upper tier display a detailed Paris skyline composed of buildings with metallic textures or finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings seen alongside the Eiffel Tower inside the snow globe exhibit a metallic color and reflective qualities, suggesting detailed architectural designs common in a Paris skyline. Understanding of visual language and contrasts in color supports the perception of metallic textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lower tier contain dense, vibrant green vegetation including trees, hedges, and garden elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lower tier of the snow globe featuring vibrant green trees, hedges, and neatly arranged pathways, consistent with a garden setting. This is evident in the detailed vegetation presented which fits garden elements often found surrounding the Eiffel Tower.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible silvery or white flake-like particles floating between the upper and lower tiers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinctly visible white flake-like particles dispersed within the snow globe, contributing to the snow-like effect characteristic of such globes. The particles appear suspended and not limited to a single tier, though most are surrounding the upper tier buildings and the Eiffel Tower.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the scene feature sculpted cobblestone patterns and classic street lamps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's snow globe features a base that visually mimics the cobblestone and streetlamp design depicted in miniaturized form around the bottom area of the globe, consistent with simplistic but classic decoration frequently found in model representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers visible in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one Eiffel Tower is visible, situated prominently in the center of the snow globe rather than depicting a duplicate. This contrasts with Image A which shows two towers. The edited presentation in Image B opts for singularity to maintain focus within the miniature setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scene exhibit characteristics of a miniature 3D model, such as exaggerated perspective, reduced scale, or model-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a snow globe depiction, inherently exhibits qualities of a miniature model. The Eiffel Tower and skyline are shown in reduced scale with exaggeration in features to fit within the confines of the globe, representative of model-like characteristics. Understanding of miniatures confirms this interpretation.",
