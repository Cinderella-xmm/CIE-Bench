      "question": "Does the entire photo exhibit a bright and soft watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses light colors and blends that resemble a watercolor painting. It has diffused tones and a gentle blending in various areas, such as the sky and clothing, giving the impression of a bright and soft watercolor style. My observation is based on the visual cues such as color blending and the softness of the outlines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ground depicted using semi-abstract brushstrokes with slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the ground lacks sharp detailing and appears in soft, blended tones rather than distinct lines or textures. This suggests the use of semi-abstract brushstrokes that create a slightly blurred effect. The visual information shows softer transitions and the absence of sharp focus or defined textures contributes to the semi-abstract interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background buildings rendered with semi-abstract brushstrokes and slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background buildings have blurred outlines and lack detailed features, suggesting the use of semi-abstract brushstrokes with slightly blurred colors. This is noticeable from the soft transitions and lack of defined detail that is typical in watercolor-like or semi-abstract artworks.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a consistently bright and soft aesthetic throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uniformly employs light colors and a softened style across all elements, including the sky, character, and background through consistent blending. This indicates a uniform bright and soft aesthetic, as seen in watercolor interpretations. The absence of harsh lines or deep contrasts confirms this observation.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the characterâ€™s position and posture been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in the edited image retains the same posture and position as depicted in the original, evident through the similar arm and leg positioning, orientation on the skateboard, and overall stance. Visual cues from both images align directly, indicating that there are no changes in position or posture.",
