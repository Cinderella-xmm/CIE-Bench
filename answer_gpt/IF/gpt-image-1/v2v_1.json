      "question": "Is there a themed box with an industrial aesthetic design present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a box with a metal casing and riveted corners, which visually resembles industrial design elements. The use of metal and rivets is typical of industrial aesthetics, suggesting functionality, durability, and a technical theme. The design is consistent with what is commonly recognized as an industrial-themed aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the box displayed in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the box in such a way that its sides and top are visible, giving it a three-dimensional look without showing perspective convergence. This aligns with the characteristics of an isometric perspective, where the dimensions are clearly visible, but the lines remain parallel rather than converging as in a standard perspective view.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there organized compartments within the box that elegantly showcase each bearing and component?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the box in Image B, there are clearly defined compartments that separate each bearing and related components. The arrangement appears orderly and is likely designed for both aesthetics and functionality, showcasing each piece individually. This organized layout gives a sophisticated and elegant appearance to how the items are presented.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary bearing outside the box in Image B is shown with a high level of detail, including clear reflections and the texture of the metal, resembling characteristics commonly associated with photorealistic rendering. This level of detail in the depiction suggests a lifelike representation, which is indicative of photorealism.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary bearing outside the box is depicted with clear, polished surfaces that exhibit metallic qualities such as sheen and reflectivity. The details of the design, including the structural elements and finish, are emphasized, drawing attention to its intricacy and craftsmanship, which fits the description given.",
