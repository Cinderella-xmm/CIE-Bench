      "question": "Is the overall composition stylized with strong geometric lines, symmetry, and decorative elements typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition features prominent geometric lines and symmetry. The suit is characterized by strong, well-defined lines that are accentuated by angular shapes. These elements, along with the polished appearance and the use of decorative zigzag patterns, align with the Art Deco style, known for its emphasis on geometry, symmetry, and ornamental design. By leveraging world knowledge of Art Deco, it is evident that the design elements in this image correspond to that style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suit’s contours replaced with bold, angular geometric shapes in metallic silver and blue colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit’s contours are defined by bold and angular geometric shapes that are accentuated by a color palette of metallic-looking silver and blue. This distinct design choice gives the overall composition a dynamic and modern appearance, which is typical of Art Deco elements that often played with metallic and bold color schemes. The visual cues and knowledge of Art Deco's stylized and futuristic fashion influence lead to this conclusion.",

      "question": "Does the chair feature sleek, linear, or repeating decorative patterns consistent with Art Deco streamlining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B is depicted with a series of sleek, linear patterns that curve in a repeating fashion, reminiscent of classic Art Deco streamlining. This style often incorporates linear symmetry and ornamental motifs that convey a sense of elegance and modernity. The chair's design, with its fluid transitions and decorative repetition, fits well within the Art Deco aesthetic, supporting this observation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a gradient transitioning through warm sunset colors such as orange, red, and purple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B exhibits a gradient effect that transitions through warm colors such as orange and red. These colors mirror those typically found in sunset scenes, with a seamless blend from one hue to the next. However, purple is not prominently observed in the transitioning gradient within the image itself. Nonetheless, the existing warm colors align with the Art Deco palette and the illustrative scene constructed in the image. Thus, acknowledging the warm transition aligns with Art Deco's dramatic use of color.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the figure maintained its original seated pose with arms crossed and facial features (such as the mustache and closed eyes) clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure retains the original seated pose with arms positioned deliberately, which is similar to many classic portrait styles. However, the details such as facial features (mustache and closed eyes) are intentionally obscured due to the blurred face. Instead, the attention focuses on the stylized design elements of the body and suit. As the face details are not clearly visible and the focus is on stylized patterns, the figure’s pose stands as the constant element observed.",
