    "Question": "Q3: Has the scarecrow's body been replaced with glossy, weather-resistant materials instead of natural straw?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the scarecrow with a more uniform and sleek appearance that could symbolize weather-resistant materials. However, the visual does not indicate an obvious glossiness or artificial material texture.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the scarecrow's hat designed with a visible cavity or opening suitable for holding a candle, indicating it is a detachable candle holder?",

    "Question": "Q5: Are LED string lights visibly present in the image, either on or near the scarecrow or packaging, emitting a soft glow?",

This aligns with common packaging strategies for themed items where accessories are displayed prominently.",
