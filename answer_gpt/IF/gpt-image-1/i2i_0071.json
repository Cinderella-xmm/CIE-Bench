    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the train been transformed into a futuristic maglev train design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train's design has sleek lines with a streamlined front, which are common characteristics of futuristic and maglev train designs, suggesting that the train might be perceived as a futuristic maglev train. The knowledge of maglev trains includes awareness of their typically aerodynamic and modern appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train retain the original white and red color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a train with a white body and a red stripe, indicating it retains the original color scheme as such a color arrangement is commonly associated with modern trains too. The utilization of color in railroad design often maintains distinct color schemes for visibility and branding purposes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the train incorporate elements indicative of maglev technology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the train on elevated tracks, which could suggest integration of maglev technology that often involves levitation above tracks instead of traditional rail and wheel systems. The aerodynamic design is reminiscent of maglev trains, which usually emphasize efficiency and speed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train still appear recognizable as a train despite the futuristic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains recognizable features such as the elongated structure, windows, and tracks that are typical of trains despite its sleek, futuristic design. Common recognition of train elements aids in identifying it as a train even with design modifications.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have all parts of the original train been transformed into the new maglev design, with no elements of the old design remaining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the traditional elements such as the basic train shape, windows, and structure endure alongside the new design, indicating not all components have been fully transformed. The fusion of older design elements with newer advancements is common in evolving transportation technology.",
