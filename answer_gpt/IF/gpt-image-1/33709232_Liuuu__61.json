      "question": "Is the tall building replaced with a towering automaton featuring a sleek, white, armored body and mechanical windows as apertures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the prominent element behind the traditional building is no longer a tall building but rather a large automaton. The automaton has a sleek, white body similar to armor, and its surface features elements resembling mechanical windows. The reasoning is based on visually identifying the sleek and robotic structure replacing the building observed in Image A.",

      "question": "Has the traditional Japanese roof been converted into stylized shoulder pads with embedded intricate patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traditional Japanese roof is still visible at the top of the building; it has not been converted into shoulder pads. The automaton appears to have separate armor pieces for its shoulders distinct from the roof elements. Analysis suggests the structural roof remains unchanged from its traditional design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all traffic signs replaced with holographic symbols that appear to float or emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traffic signs are altered to appear as illuminated, futuristic holographic symbols. The signs have a glowing appearance, contrasting the physical signs present in Image A. The assessment determined that they have a digital and holographic character based on their visual appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pedestrians in the street replaced with robotic figures featuring geometric designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the human figure seen in Image A with robotic figures. These robots exhibit geometric designs, matching the appearance of futuristic models. The conclusion is drawn from the analysis of the distinct robotic design, which replaces the human pedestrian imagery.",

      "question": "Has the streetscape been altered to include robotic elements and geometric designs consistent with a futuristic urban environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a significant transformation of the streetscape, incorporating robotic elements, and geometric designs. The presence of the large automaton, robotic figures, and holographic signs collectively indicate a shift from traditional to futuristic urban architecture. The analysis accounts for these transformations when comparing to Image A's traditional elements.",
