      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building features sharp, angular edges throughout its architectural elements, such as rooflines, window frames, and doorways.

      "question": "Are the window frames and plant motifs enhanced with visible gold foil-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window frames and certain plant motifs on the building appear to have visible gold accents that mimic the look of gold foil. These details are highlighted with a shiny, reflective quality typical of gold foil-like enhancements, adding a decorative element to the design.",

      "question": "Is the entrance awning colored in a bold crimson hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entrance awning in Image B is distinctly colored in a bold crimson hue, as indicated by its vibrant red color, which stands out against the rest of the building's design. This choice of color is visually striking and aligns with common uses of crimson for attention-catching signage and awnings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a background with a textured, cream-colored appearance resembling paper. The off-white color and implied texture give the impression of a fine-quality paper or cardstock, commonly used in artistic representations like postcards to provide an elegant and professional background.",

      "question": "Does each postcard feature a geometric arch border around its edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear geometric arch border around the image, which helps frame the central art piece and gives it a classic, contained appearance. This arch design is consistent with decorative motifs often used in postcards, highlighting the central image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the postcards presented without any visible frame or border, maintaining a clean, borderless edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly features an arch border around its elements, which contradicts the concept of having a borderless edge. Thus, the postcards are not presented without any frame or border; rather, they have a defined edge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there exactly three separate postcards displayed, each showing a variation of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one postcard displayed, showcasing a stylized depiction of the hotel building. There are no additional postcards indicating multiple variations; therefore, the description does not fit multiple separate postcards.",
