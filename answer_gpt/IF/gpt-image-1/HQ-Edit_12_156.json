      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower depicted as a fantasy beacon emitting mystical energy rather than a standard metallic structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is represented with glowing elements, specifically the floral designs that seem to emit a mystical glow, suggesting an energy source, which is not typical for the standard metallic Eiffel Tower structure. This depiction aligns with the concept of a fantasy beacon, as the tower appears imbued with magical attributes rather than the real-world, metal construction that is depicted in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the original metal lattice components replaced with enchanted vines and glowing floral motifs throughout the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows vines and floral motifs wrapping around the structure of the tower, replacing the standard metal lattice seen in Image A. These elements are distinctly enchanted, with luminescent qualities that set them apart from the common metal components originally used in the Eiffel Tower's construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top of the tower feature a crystal-like pinnacle instead of the original metallic spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the tower in Image B, there is a crystal-like structure, piercing the sky, which is a departure from the usual metallic spire seen in Image A's depiction of the Eiffel Tower. This crystal adds to the fantasy aesthetic and is distinct from the traditional architectural features of the original tower.",

    {

      "question": "Has the base of the tower been replaced with an ancient stone platform featuring engraved arcane symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the tower appears to be transformed into an ancient stone platform, complete with designs that resemble arcane symbols, deviating from the typical groundwork of the Eiffel Tower seen in Image A. These symbols suggest a mystical or ancient quality rather than the conventional industrial design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a night sky filled with vibrant, swirling nebulae and stars, enhancing the fantasy theme. These cosmic elements seem to mirror the illuminated qualities of the tower, suggesting a connection between the tower and the celestial backdrop, contrary to the typical sunset sky seen in Image A.",
