      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall visual impression is that the map and pins appear to be made from ceramic mosaic tiles. This conclusion can be drawn from the intricate tile patterns and the appearance of grout lines between the tiles, which are characteristic of mosaic artwork. The map and pins are depicted using these mosaic elements, suggesting a transformation into a ceramic mosaic tile artwork.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic artwork display bold patterns and rich textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the map and pins made with a mosaic technique, which inherently involves bold patterns due to the tiled design. Additionally, ceramic tiles often exhibit rich textures with varying depth, sheen, and color gradation, all of which are evident here. These properties contribute to the bold and textured appearance of the artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the original layout and positioning of the map and pins been maintained in the mosaic artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows the map with four pins positioned in specific locations connected by lines, and this arrangement is visually mirrored in Image B. Despite the differences in texture and style due to the mosaic treatment, the layout and positions of the pins and connecting lines remain the same. Therefore, the original spatial arrangement is preserved in the mosaic artwork.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic artwork convey a lively appearance through vibrant colors and dynamic designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of vibrant colors and dynamic patterns in ceramic tiles often leads to a lively and engaging appearance, as seen in Image B. The brightness of colors used for the pins and map elements, combined with the mosaic's intricate designs, contributes to a lively and dynamic aesthetic.",

      "question": "Do the map and pins appear to be made of ceramic tiles rather than their original materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the map and pins as composed of small, colored tiles arranged in a grout-filled pattern is indicative of ceramic mosaic art. This contrasts with the original materials in Image A, which appear more conventional (paper map and plastic pins). Thus, the map and pins in Image B indeed resemble ceramic tiles.",
