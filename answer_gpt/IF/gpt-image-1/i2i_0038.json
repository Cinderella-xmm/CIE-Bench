        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is clearly a simplified, cartoon-like line drawing. Key features such as the person's pose, clothing, and expression have been transformed into a basic line art style, which is common in cartoon depictions. Despite the lack of color and detail, the cartoon's posture and key elements remain recognizable, which indicates simplification into a cartoon form.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon-style Image B, the person has a clear open mouth expression which suggests joy, speaking, or laughter typically associated with such poses. In many cartoon drawings, expressive features like an open mouth are exaggerated to convey a specific emotion or action.",
