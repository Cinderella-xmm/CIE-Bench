      "question": "Are detailed crochet stitches visibly present on the cactus and its sombrero?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of the cactus and its sombrero are present on a packaging box illustration rather than actual physical items. In illustrations on packaging, details like crochet stitches are often simplified or graphically represented without specifics of texture. This means the detailed crochet stitches are not visually evident in the illustrated form typically used on product packaging.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donkey on the packaging has an illustrated representation where its mane appears textured in a drawn form, and its body features a colorful striped pattern. Illustrations often highlight characteristics such as textures and patterns even when not presented in tactile form. The use of vibrant colors confirms the presence of a lively striped pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus and donkey are indeed illustrated on a packaging box labeled 'Knitted Amigos'. This observation is drawn from the clear image of the box with the label prominently displayed on the front. The objects are depicted as part of the packaging design rather than physically positioned inside.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a packaging design that includes bright colors and floral designs. However, it lacks explicit Mexican motifs such as sombreros or maracas. The design elements are more aligned with general playful and colorful themes rather than specific cultural motifs.",
