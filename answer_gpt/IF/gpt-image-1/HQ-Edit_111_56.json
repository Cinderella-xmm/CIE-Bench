    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the ballerina depicted as a stone sculpture rather than a living person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina appears to be made of stone, suggesting characteristics typical of a sculpture. The texture resembles carved stone, rather than skin or fabric, which supports the conclusion that it is indeed a sculpture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing of the ballerina appears to have intricate folds and draping that are reminiscent of classical Greek attire, unlike the simpler tutu seen in Image A. This suggests the garments are designed to resemble classical Greek robes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible stylized laurel wreath present on the figure’s head. The hairstyle does not suggest any additional ornamentation like a laurel wreath.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure’s surface display a marble-like texture with visible chisel marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the figure in Image B resembles marble, with a textured appearance. However, there are no specific visible chisel marks typically associated with classical sculpture, just a smooth stone-like texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there Ionic columns present in the background of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Is the floor beneath the figure composed of a mosaic pattern made of small colored tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B appears to be composed of what seems to be a mosaic pattern, but it is not clearly made of small colored tiles; it has a uniform color suggesting it’s a stone pattern rather than a true mosaic.",

    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
