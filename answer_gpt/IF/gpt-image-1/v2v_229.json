      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays a cartoonish, simplified version of a bedroom scene with exaggerated features, such as smiling faces on the pillows and other elements. The style is highly characteristic of kawaii, which is a Japanese term referring to a style that aims for 'cute' and 'adorable' aesthetics, often using bright colors and friendly shapes. Therefore, the scene is indeed a kawaii-style representation.",

      "question": "Are there glossy metallic outlines present in the enamel pin design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design includes black outlines around each element, such as the bed, candles, and pillows. These lines are typically present in enamel pins to separate different colored enamel fills and add definition. Although the image doesn't directly show metallic shine, the form and context imply that these outlines represent the metallic outlines often found in enamel pin designs.",

      "question": "Does the enamel pin feature bright and colorful enamel fills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) uses bright and vibrant colors, such as orange and yellow for the bedding and walls. The window is depicted with a contrasting bright blue fill. These colors align with the common practice in enamel pins where vivid and solid colors are used to make the details pop, indicating a design intention to use colorful enamel fills.",

      "question": "Are there any additional elements included in the enamel pin design beyond the bedroom scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B features elements directly related to the bedroom scene, including a lamp, bed, candles, and pillows with faces, creating a cohesive design that reflects the original bedroom scene. There are no elements present that do not belong to a bedroom setting. Thus, the enamel pin does not include additional or unrelated elements.",

      "question": "Is the enamel pin mockup presented in a square format on a plain white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, showing the enamel pin design, is presented with a plain white background, which is common for showcasing designs clearly. However, the shape of the pin mockup is not square; rather, it follows the contours of the bedroom scene, specifically forming a shape around the outer edges of the depicted objects. Thus, it is not in a square format.",
