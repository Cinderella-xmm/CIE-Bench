      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Aquatic warrior rendered as a three-dimensional model rather than a flat 2D image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior appears to be enclosed within a glass dome which gives the impression of volume and depth. The glass dome and the marine decorations add a dimension that is not present in two-dimensional images. The figure itself has volumetric shading and reflections suggesting three-dimensionality, indications that it is not simply flat but rather a 3D model.",

      "question": "Is the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior enclosed within a dome that features marine-themed decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual cues in Image B show the Aquatic warrior in a protective transparent dome. The decorations around the figure imply a marine theme, with swirling water-like features and a textured surface reminiscent of underwater scenery. This suggests the enclosure is both protective and designed with a maritime theme.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor in Image B appears to have a shiny, reflective surface, with highlights that are characteristic of metallic textures. The color scheme shows varying shades of blue, indicating attention to detail and complex shading typical for metallic surfaces.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the 3D model on a base featuring textured elements that emulate patterns found in coral reefs. It contains stylized structures mimicking the appearance of coral formations, which supports the aquatic theme.",
