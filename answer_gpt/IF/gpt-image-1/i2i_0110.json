      "question": "Is the vase placed on what appears to be a modern kitchen dining table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase has been placed on a wooden table with a smooth surface, which is typically used in dining settings in modern kitchens.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the background feature sunlight streaming through venetian blinds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a strong visual cue of parallel shadows and light beams which are indicative of sunlight streaming through venetian blinds. The appearance of slats and the directionality of the light and shadows on the wall in the background support this observation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the vase and sunflowers still the primary focus of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase with sunflowers retains a central position in the composition, and it stands out with its distinct, bright colors against the more subdued tones of the background. This draws the viewer's attention directly to the vase and sunflowers, making them the primary focus.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of a minimalist wooden table, simply designed chairs, and the light streaming through venetian blinds are typical features found in modern kitchens. These elements together create an impression that the setting could be a modern kitchen.",

      "question": "Do light and shadow effects consistent with sunlight flowing through blinds appear in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features distinct shadows and light patterns on the table and chairs that align with the orientation of the venetian blinds. This effect is typical when sunlight streams through slatted blinds, casting parallel lines of light and shadow, which can be observed in the image.",
