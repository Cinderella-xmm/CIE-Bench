      "question": "Are there five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls representing the individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visibly five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls lined up, each featuring similar characteristics and attire such as a pink sweater and blue jeans, indicating that they are representing the same individual. This is deduced by recognizing typical elements of Russian nesting dolls, where each progressively smaller doll is similar in design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls sized from biggest to smallest in a progressive manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are arranged from left to right in a decreasing order of size, characteristic of traditional Russian nesting dolls which fit one inside another. This understanding comes from the alignment and the known sequential pattern observed in such dolls.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls accurately reflect the individual's attire and stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each nesting doll in Image B depicts the same attire as the individual shown in a pink sweater and blue jeans. The stance, particularly the hand placement and posture, is also mirrored from the individual to the dolls, demonstrating an accurate representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are positioned in a neat row on the wooden table, placed directly adjacent to the TV. This neatness is visible as each doll is aligned closely to the next in the progressive size order, reflecting an organized arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain an aspect ratio of 3:2?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aspect ratio refers to the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image. In Image B, a rough estimation based on the visible framing suggests that the width is more prevalent relative to the height, commonly matching a 3:2 ratio which is a standard for many images. This conclusion comes from visually comparing spatial dimensions typically associated with the aspect ratio in photography.",
