      "question": "Has the hummingbird been transformed into a non-biological, ethereal entity resembling a garden spirit rather than a realistic bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird is depicted with features not found in reality—such as glowing, petal-like structures and vine-like appendages—suggesting a transformation into an ethereal entity, possibly resembling a garden spirit. This contrasts with Image A where the bird appears realistic with natural feathers and physical bird-like attributes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings of the hummingbird appear as iridescent, glass-like structures that display a full rainbow spectrum of shimmering colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are distinctly iridescent and have a glass-like appearance, showcasing multiple shimmering colors akin to a rainbow spectrum. This is not a characteristic observed in biological hummingbirds or in Image A, indicating a fantastical transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the body feathers of the hummingbird replaced with glowing, petal-like structures that emit light or have a luminous appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the hummingbird in Image B is adorned with glowing petal-like structures instead of feathers, emitting a soft light, which suggests a departure from biological characteristics. Image A shows traditional feathers, confirming a fanciful alteration in Image B.",

      "question": "Has the beak been replaced with a transparent, crystalline spout from which a golden or honey-colored liquid (floral nectar) is visibly flowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beak is replaced with a distinct transparent structure resembling a crystalline spout, from which a golden liquid flows. Image A presents a normal hummingbird beak, indicating a magical or artistic alteration in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation in Image B extends to the tail, which consists of green, leafy vines with blossoms. This naturalistic integration contrasts with Image A, where the tail is traditional and feathered, indicating a blend with the garden environment in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ethereal qualities of the hummingbird, including its vine-like tail and glowing petals, are designed to harmonize with the surrounding garden, creating a cohesive visual blend. Image A's realistic bird stands out against the garden setting, highlighting the intentional integration in Image B.",
