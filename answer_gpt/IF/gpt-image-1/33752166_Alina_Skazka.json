      "question": "Does the edited image show the building transformed into a giant mechanical golem with visible articulated limbs and exposed gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a humanoid mechanical structure, akin to a robot or golem, with articulated limbs and exposed gears. This is indicated by the presence of arms, legs, and a torso, with visible joints and mechanical detailing. In contrast, Image A captures a high-rise building without any humanoid features. Thus, Image B depicts a transformation into a giant mechanical golem.",

      "question": "Are all original windows replaced with glowing energy panels that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the humanoid figure features multiple glowing panels integrated into its structure, emitting a bright light. These panels resemble energy sources or windows, and almost all visible sections of the figure emit light. In Image A, the building has traditional glass windows without any light emission. Comparing both images, it's clear that Image B shows a transformation with glowing energy panels replacing the original windows.",

      "question": "Have the balconies been transformed into arm-like mechanical appendages extending from the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a humanoid mechanical figure with arm-like appendages extending from its body. These appendages are detailed with mechanical parts and joints, resembling robot arms. Image A features a building with various balconies, which do not possess this mechanical appearance. Thus, the balconies in Image B have indeed been transformed into mechanical appendages.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate circuit patterns covering the surface of the building, resembling electronic wiring or circuits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear visual cues such as detailed engravings, lines, and patterns covering the surface of the mechanical figure, emulating electronic circuits or wiring. This intricate design is part of the mechanical aesthetic. Image A, however, shows a plain building surface without such detailing. Therefore, Image B does showcase circuit-like patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the building's angular edges appear as dynamic or movable mechanical components, such as hinges, pistons, or rotating joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the machinery and design features of the humanoid figure include articulated joints and structural parts that imply movement capabilities, like hinges and pistons, aligning with the mechanical nature of such a golem. Image A's angular edges are static, being part of an architectural design without any mechanical components. Thus, Image B’s edges suggest dynamic motion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a clear blue sky as their background. There are no additional elements or modifications observable in the sky of Image B. Therefore, the background remains unchanged with a clear blue sky.",

      "question": "Has the building’s overall size and position within the frame remained consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The position within the frame has changed significantly. Image A depicts a building rising from the bottom left, occupying a substantial vertical portion of the photograph. In Image B, the mechanical figure takes a central position without the same vertical span or continuity in scale relative to the frame. Therefore, the size and position have not remained consistent in Image B.",
