      "question": "Are the surfaces of the cabin and surrounding landscape rendered with visible, dappled brushstrokes instead of smooth, photorealistic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the cabin and the surrounding landscape display visible, dappled brushstrokes, which are characteristic of an impressionistic painting style. This style involves using distinct brushstrokes to create a sense of texture and movement, rather than achieving photorealistic smooth textures. The brushstrokes in the edited image give the surfaces a textured and dynamic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image softened and blended, with reduced contrast and no sharp edges between color areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are indeed softened and blended compared to photorealistic representation. The transition between colors is gradual, lacking sharp edges, which results from the dappled brushstroke technique that smooths out lines and reduces contrast between color patches. This creates a more harmonious and unified feel throughout the image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the surrounding fir trees depicted with loose, expressive brushstrokes and enhanced or non-naturalistic coloration compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding fir trees are depicted with loose and expressive brushstrokes, which give a sense of movement and texture. The colors are enhanced with a more vibrant palette that doesn't strictly adhere to naturalistic tones, which is typical of impressionistic or expressionistic artwork. This style contrasts with the more realistic representation in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the chimney rendered as a soft, blurred plume with indistinct edges, suggesting motion and warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke emanating from the chimney is rendered with soft, blurred edges, creating a plume that appears to be in motion. The indistinct and softened nature of the smoke contributes to the overall warm and cozy atmosphere of the scene. This portrayal differs from potentially sharper and more defined smoke trails in a realistic image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ground covered in snow, and are there visible falling snowflakes, maintaining the serene winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is indeed covered in snow, which is depicted with the same dappled brushstroke style as the cabin and landscape. Although individual snowflakes may not be distinctly visible due to the impressionistic technique, the overall appearance and setting still convey a serene winter scene, consistent with the serene winter theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the cabin, chimney, surrounding trees, and snow-covered ground still clearly identifiable and present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the shift to an impressionistic style in Image B, the essential elements of the cabin, chimney, surrounding trees, and snow-covered ground are still clearly identifiable. The artistic choice of brushstrokes and color application doesn't obscure these elements; instead, it reinterprets them while maintaining their recognizability and presence in the scene.",
