      "question": "Does the robot feature streamlined, symmetrical forms with chrome or highly reflective metallic surfaces typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is depicted with smooth, symmetrical forms characteristic of Art Deco design, emphasizing geometric shapes and elegance. The robot does not have chrome or highly reflective surfaces, as it is presented more like a sculpture with even shading rather than reflective metal. Art Deco design prioritizes sleekness and stylization, which is reflected in the robot's design here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos depicted as stylized geometric patterns rather than realistic birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingos are rendered using simplified shapes, creating a geometric pattern effect instead of the detailed, realistic depiction of flamingos. This stylization aligns with an Art Deco artistic approach, which often uses streamlined, abstracted forms to represent subjects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees in the background have angular, geometric forms instead of natural, curved shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are stylized with angular geometric forms, departing from the natural, curved appearance of real palm trees. The geometric and angular representation of the palm trees aligns with the Art Deco style, which often features simplified and abstracted forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rocks in the background rendered with stylized, geometric shapes rather than natural rock formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no natural-looking rocks; instead, the background is filled with geometric elements. The lack of natural rock formations and the presence of stylized geometric shapes are consistent with an Art Deco style, focusing on abstractions and design elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a muted pastel color palette, avoiding strong or vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is rendered with muted colors and pastel tones, typical of an Art Deco palette, which often uses softer shades rather than harsh or vibrant colors. This choice contributes to the nostalgic and decorative feeling associated with the Art Deco style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot positioned centrally among the flamingos, maintaining the original compositional layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is centrally positioned among the flamingos, maintaining the original compositional layout observed in Image A. The central placement highlights the robot as a focal point, consistent with typical compositional strategies.",
