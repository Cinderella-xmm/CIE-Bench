      "question": "Has the bird been converted into a stylized illustrated emblem rather than remaining a photorealistic depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted with bold, smooth outlines and minimal detail, which is characteristic of an illustrated emblem. This contrasts with the photorealistic detail seen in Image A, where the bird exhibits detailed textures and shading. Understanding the difference between illustration and photorealism, the bird in Image B fits the description of a stylized illustration as it focuses on simpler shapes and lacks intricate detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird retains a vivid yellow color, similar to the vibrant shade presented in Image A. The consistency in the primary color of the bird across both images indicates that the vibrant yellow has been preserved in the edited version, even if the depiction style changed.",

      "question": "Are cherry blossom motifs visibly surrounding the bird emblem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features cherry blossom motifs encircling the bird, with soft pink flowers depicted on the branches. This reflects the same floral theme observed in Image A, though presented with a more simplistic, artistic style in Image B. The identification of these motifs relies on visual recognition of typical cherry blossom shapes and arrangement.",

      "question": "Is there a typographic logo located at the top of the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the words 'PREMIUM TEA' are prominently situated at the top part of the design. This typographic element serves as a logo or branding element often used in packaging design. Recognizing this by assessing the layout and position confirms the presence of text as a key visual component of the design.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a soft pastel gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B displays a gradation from a light to a slightly darker pastel tone, creating a smooth transition effect typical of pastel gradients. Image A, in comparison, has a more uniform and natural background without such a gradient. The understanding of color transitions and design elements like pastel gradients aids in identifying this feature in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a structured and organized layout typical of packaging, featuring elements like a typographic logo, emblematic illustration, and decorative motifs. This coherent arrangement, paired with visual elements like text and borders, is indicative of a commercial product design, such as a tea box. This conclusion draws from common packaging design practices.",
