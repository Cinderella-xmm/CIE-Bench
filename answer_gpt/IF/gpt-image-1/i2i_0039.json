      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a polar bear and its cubs are clearly visible on an icy setting surrounded by water, which is consistent with Image A's depiction. The key subjects remain unchanged between the two images, focusing on the same natural scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall tone of the image appears to be cooler with an emphasis on blues and whites, making it look chillier compared to a neutral or warmer color tone. This cooling effect enhances the cold nature of the icy environment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there’s text in the top right corner that reads 'NOWHERE TO GO.' This messaging serves as a headline, but it does not contain the words 'Only Ice Left,' which are not visible in the image provided.",
