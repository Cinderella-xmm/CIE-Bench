        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a design style that incorporates flowing lines and organic forms, which are key characteristics of the Art Nouveau style.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflowers are not presented with the detail and realism typical of botanical illustrations. Instead, they are rendered with stylized patterns that retain the essential shape of a sunflower but are depicted using flowing, abstract lines that align with an Art Nouveau aesthetic. This artistic approach avoids realistic botanical details in favor of a more decorative style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hairstyle in Image B is no longer depicted with realistic braids as in Image A; instead, it showcases swirling, ornamental motifs.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is depicted with swirling and fluid patterns that cover the fabric surface, providing a sense of movement and decoration typical of Art Nouveau fashion.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunflower field in Image B is transformed into a collection of intricate, curling lines and soft curves rather than a realistic depiction of a landscape. These design elements align with the Art Nouveau style, which favors stylization and decorative flourishes over realistic portrayal. The field is thus rendered as an abstract tapestry, full of artistic curves.",
