      "question": "Does the cake feature bold, graphic icing patterns such as geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs instead of realistic frosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The icing on the cake in Image B is depicted with bold, graphic zigzag patterns and colors that contrast with the pink icing seen in Image A. This representation aligns with pop art styles, which favor abstract motifs over realistic textures. The visual cue of stylized icing in Image B leads to the conclusion that these are indeed geometric or repetitive motifs.",

      "question": "Are the balloons composed of vivid monochrome dots rather than solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are filled with a pattern of dots that are monochrome, visible in different colors such as blue and red. This differs from Image A where the balloons have solid colors. The presence of these dotted patterns aligns with the pop art style, which often employs such textual patterns.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the table rendered as a flat, solid color block without texture or gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table in Image B is represented as a flat, solid color block in orange, without any visible texture or gradients. This differs from Image A where the table features a wooden texture reflecting realistic aesthetics. Pop art often uses solid color blocks to emphasize shapes and forms, elimination of texture reinforces this style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase depicted as a solid color block without visible texture or design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is rendered in a solid color block of blue without any additional texture or intricate design. This contrasts with Image A where the vase displays subtle textures or designs. The lack of texture in Image B matches the pop art aesthetic which uses solid colors to enhance simple and bold shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the candle flame have exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candle flame is drawn with sharp lines and bright colors like yellow and red, creating a star-like appearance. This contrasts with Image A, where the flame has a soft, natural glow. The stylization in Image B aligns with pop art characteristics, which often exaggerate parts of objects to transform them into bold graphic statements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit characteristics of pop art, including flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays pop art characteristics throughout. The flat color scheme, bold outlines, and stylized designs are evident across elements like balloons, cake, and other surrounding objects. In comparison to the more realistic rendering of Image A, Image B's use of bright, contrasting colors and distinct outlines aligns with the visual language of pop art. Pop art typically emphasizes simplicity and vibrancy, all of which are present in Image B.",
