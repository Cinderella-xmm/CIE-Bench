    "Question": "Q1: Is the cow depicted in a stylized 3D chibi art style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cow features exaggerated proportions typical of chibi style, such as a large head, big eyes, and small body. These elements combined with the 3D rendering align with a stylized chibi art style. My reasoning is based on recognizing the unique characteristics of chibi art style, which are evident in the visual cues such as the cow's expression and design.",
