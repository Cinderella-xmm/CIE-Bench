      "question": "Has the desk and background been replaced with a forest floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment consists of a forest floor with natural elements such as soil, moss, and scattered leaves, implying the broccoli is placed outdoors. This contrasts with Image A's indoor setting, where the broccoli is situated on a plate on a marble countertop.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the broccoli appear camouflaged as a small real tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli's placement among the greenery and forest floor setting makes it visually analogous to a small tree. Its coloration and shape align well with a real tree, which creates a camouflage effect. This perception differs from Image A, where the broccoli is clearly defined as a piece of food due to its indoor setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there sunlight filtering through the canopy in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B suggests sunlight filtering through a forest canopy, as evident from the bright spots and shadows typical of sunlight moving through tree leaves. Such lighting isn't present in Image A, which has consistent indoor lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the broccoli positioned naturally within the forest floor, as if it were growing there?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli appears to be integrated into the forest floor environment, with its base on the ground among foliage, simulating the appearance of it growing there naturally. Image A shows the broccoli on a plate indoors, which clearly lacks this natural positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene convey a natural and believable camouflage effect of the broccoli as a tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition and setting in Image B contributes to a convincing camouflage effect, where the broccoli blends well with its surrounding environment in the forest, resembling a small tree. Image A offers no such camouflage effect due to its indoor presentation.",
