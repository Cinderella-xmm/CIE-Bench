      "question": "Has the mango been transformed into a whimsical figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is depicted with a face, limbs, and expressive features such as large eyes on the side with cubed sections, making it appear as a cute, whimsical character. This transformation changes it from a simple fruit to a playful, anthropomorphic figure. Such a depiction is typical of cartoon-style art, where inanimate objects are given human-like qualities.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango pieces forming part of the character's head appear larger and more exaggerated compared to normal mango cubes, giving the overall design a more stylized and whimsical appearance than in Image A, where the pieces were more naturally sized.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mango pieces in Image B are bright and have a shiny appearance with highlights that give them a 3D effect. This visual style enhances the glossy and light-reflective surfaces, common in cartoon designs to convey a three-dimensional look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime and chili powder bowl have simplified, exaggerated forms with bold lines and smooth textures, likely designed to match the cartoonish style of the mango character. These characteristics contribute to the overall impression of a cartoon-like design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to have wood paneling similar to a shelf or cabinet surface. This is simpler and less detailed compared to the tabletop surface in Image A, suggesting that the objects are arranged on a cartoon-style shelf setting.",
