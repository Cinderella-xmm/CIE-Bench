    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck displays a distinctly crystalline appearance, characterized by highly reflective, angular planes that share similarities with the facets typically found in emeralds and jade. The entire body of the truck appears constructed from these types of reflective planes, suggesting an artistic rendering into a precious gem-like material, rather than a normal metallic construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
    "explanation": "The surfaces of the cabin and body in Image B are covered with angular, faceted planes. These facets are expertly designed to reflect and refract light, creating a shimmering effect typical of crystal materials. This aligns with the artistic intention of portraying the truck in a gem-like, crystalline form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?",
    "explanation": "A comparison between Image A (the original military truck) and Image B (the crystal truck) reveals that the structural proportions and layout are preserved. Despite the material change to a crystal-like substance, the shape, dimensions, and design details such as the cabin, cargo area, and wheels remain consistent with the original truck. This suggests a faithful recreation, utilizing the crystal material to maintain the original design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
