      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cocktail glass appear to be sculpted from clay with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass appears to have a rough, uneven surface imitating clay, suggesting handcrafted texture. This is inferred from the visual cue of the glass's surface that looks uneven and somewhat matte, characteristics typically found in sculpted clay objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ice cubes and lime slice depicted with intricate clay textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows ice cubes and a lime slice with pronounced textures common in clay models. The cubes and slice lack transparency and show discernible surface textures, resembling the hand-molded detailing in sculpted clay objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the surroundings, including the bar and bottles, exhibit a handcrafted clay appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B depicts bottles and bar elements with a smooth, dull finish and visible texture differences, typical of clay sculptures. The overall color consistency and texture align with handcrafted clay characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition maintain an organic, imperfect look characteristic of hand-sculpted clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the composition, including the glass, ice cubes, lime slice, and surroundings, all exhibit uneven surfaces and texture irregularities typical of organic, handcrafted clay work. These imperfections add to the authenticity of a clay model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting and shading adjusted to enhance the clay-like textures and three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B seems to be strategically applied to emphasize texture depth and three-dimensional appearance, akin to highlighting features in a clay model. Shadows and highlights are used to accentuate the handcrafted details and contours.",
