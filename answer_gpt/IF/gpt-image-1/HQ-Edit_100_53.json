        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows characteristics typical of traditional Japanese art styles like ukiyo-e, where bold black outlines are used to define the shapes and edges of figures and objects.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in the edited image are simplified and presented in muted pink hues, lacking the intricate detailing and vibrant colors seen in more realistic depictions.
