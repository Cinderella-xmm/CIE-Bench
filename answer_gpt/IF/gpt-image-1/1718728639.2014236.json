      "question": "Has the entire figure been rendered in a mosaic style composed of small, interlocking tesserae?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted using a mosaic style where small, interlocking tiles or tesserae are used to create the texture and patterns seen across the figure. This mosaic technique is commonly employed to depict historical and cultural imagery, often seen in Byzantine art, where small tiles come together to form the complete image. The appearance of the armor and wings suggests that they are created using this method.",

      "question": "Have the metallic components of the armor been replaced with shimmering tesserae that simulate the appearance of mosaic tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic components that would typically be seen in armor have been transformed into mosaic patterns. The shimmering effect is frequently achieved in mosaic art with glass or ceramic tiles, which mimic the reflective properties of metal. The visual effect provides the appearance of a metallic shine through tesserae arrangement, which replaces the metallic texture with detailed mosaic artwork.",
