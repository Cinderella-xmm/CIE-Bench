      "question": "Has the text \"flyaway\" been added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue of the added text 'flyaway' directly below the framed painting is evident. The irregularity associated with text appearing below a decorative image in contexts like this, usually signifies artistry or aesthetic enhancement. This knowledge allows the conclusion that text is newly added in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual style of the text 'flyaway' in Image B resembles the distinct flow and variability characteristic of handwritten scripts. Typically, handwritten fonts incorporate personal touch elements, such as varied stroke thicknesses and cursive forms, which are evident here.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the text 'flyaway' is positioned directly beneath the painting, along the horizontal midline below the painting. This is a common place for subheading or caption-style text when aligned with visual artwork.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement and font style of 'flyaway' in Image B, combined with the serene landscape painting, contribute to a romantic and whimsical aesthetic akin to postcard designs. The harmonious integration of text flows naturally within such scenes, often adding emotive or nostalgic layers.",

      "correct_answer": "No\n```",
      "explanation": "By closely examining Image B, no extra modifications or additions apart from the 'flyaway' text are visible within or below the painting area. The other elements, such as the cabinet and the potted plants, remain unchanged from typical composition styles for interior decor.",
