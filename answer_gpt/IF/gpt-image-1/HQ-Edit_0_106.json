      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the lion rendered as a high-contrast silhouette with minimal internal detail and strong edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is depicted in a solid black silhouette without any internal textures or details, and with clear, defined edges. This high-contrast silhouette creates a bold outline against the background. The absence of internal detail and the sharpness of the edges confirm it's a silhouette.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an abstract gradient composed of smooth color transitions rather than a realistic savannah landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an orange and black gradient background that lacks the detailed and realistic elements typically found in a savannah landscape, such as detailed clouds or sun. The gradient provides a smooth transition of colors, which indicates an abstract representation rather than a realistic one.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are detailed grass textures clearly visible in the foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground does not display detailed grass textures. Instead, it appears as dark silhouettes of grass-like shapes, with less detail and more focus on creating an overall silhouette effect in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the acacia trees depicted as angular, stylized silhouettes with sharp edges and geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The acacia trees in Image B are shown as dark, angular silhouettes with defined, sharp edges that simplify their form into more geometric and stylized shapes. This creates a contrast with the less detailed background, emphasizing the silhouettes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"King of the Wild\" displayed in a dramatic, bold typeface across the upper section of the image without overpowering the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'King of the Wild' in Image B is presented in a large, bold, dramatic typeface at the top of the image. It is striking but does not visually dominate the scene to the extent that it overshadows the silhouette of the lion, which remains a central visual element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned centrally and visually dominant in the composition, ensuring it remains the primary focus despite other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is centrally positioned in the lower portion of the image and is rendered in a large silhouette. This positioning, along with its significant size and contrasting against the background, ensures that the lion remains the primary focus of the composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
