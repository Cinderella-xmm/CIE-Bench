      "question": "Does the edited image show the stapler from both the front and rear views side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stapler is displayed in two distinct positions. The left side shows the front view with the part where staplers are inserted facing the viewer, while the right side presents the rear view, indicating both views are shown side by side. Visual cues such as the presence of a staple area in one view and its absence in the other confirm this identification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stapler's front and rear views arranged next to each other in a horizontal alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two images are positioned next to one another horizontally, with a clear vertical division between them. This horizontal alignment is evident because the views are parallel to each other on the plane of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all parts of the stapler visible in both the front and rear views without any truncation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, both views display the entire stapler without any cut-off parts. The stapler appears fully contained within each half of the edited image, with no portion eliminated which indicates that every section is visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the front and rear views of the stapler in the edited image match in terms of color and design details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the front and rear views of the stapler exhibit the same blue color for the main body and a consistent golden hue for the internal metallic parts, matched by design details such as rounded edges and the general form. This confirms that they correspond closely in color and design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background consistent between the front and rear views of the stapler without additional elements introduced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a consistent green background across both views with no additional elements or disparities interrupting this uniformity. The surface upon which the stapler rests and the backdrop share identical shades and textures.",
