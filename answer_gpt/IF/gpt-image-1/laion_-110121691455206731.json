      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a comic strip that clearly consists of two separate sections, each with its own distinct scene and elements such as dialogues and illustrated watch characters. This segmentation into two panels is evident through the visual separation and different actions occurring in each section.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the watch features a cartoonish face on its dial, with eyes and a mouth, indicating it has a face drawn on. The watch character is positioned behind a desk labeled 'DETECTIVE,' indicating it is seated at a detective desk. However, there is no action visible that suggests the watch is polishing its metal exterior as there are no visual cues or context indicating such an activity.",

      "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B depicts the watch character, referred to as Chrono, holding a magnifying glass next to its face.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B includes visual onomatopoeia in the form of the word 'tick' near the watch character, serving as auditory effects typically associated with clocks or watches. This indicates the presence of sound effect marks around the watch dial.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B effectively employs greyscale shades to depict the character and backdrop, which aligns with creating a comic effect while maintaining a shiny, metallic look to represent the polished silver appearance of the original watch from Image A. This blend of greyscale and silverish tones mimics the original design elements of the actual watch.",
