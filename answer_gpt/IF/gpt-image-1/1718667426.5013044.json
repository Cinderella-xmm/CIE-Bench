      "question": "Is the ogre depicted in a stylized cartoon form with exaggerated features and simplified anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the ogre is shown in a highly stylized cartoon form, characterized by its exaggerated facial features, simplified and rounded anatomy, and overall more toy-like appearance. This contrasts with the more realistic depiction of muscular anatomy and proportion seen in stylized depictions. The use of large, round eyes, a big grin, and exaggerated limbs further supports this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the muscles of the ogre significantly exaggerated and simplified compared to the original realistic depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's muscles are presented in a highly simplified form with a focus on basic shapes and clear outlines, unlike in Image A, where the muscles are more detailed and reflect realistic anatomy. Image B's simplified approach supports the notion that the muscles are indeed exaggerated in a cartoonish way.",

    {

      "question": "Does the ogre have a matte finish with no reflective surfaces and bold, thick outlines defining its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ogre in Image B has a matte finish typical of animated or cartoon characters, lacking realistic light reflections and shading. The presence of bold, thick outlines is indicative of the cartoon style, clearly separating different parts of the image, which is not found in detailed, realistic representations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the weapon is a large, brown club that appears soft and whimsical, suitable for a cartoon-like depiction. This differs from Image A's more realistic depiction of a spear made of a metallic material. The club has a playful, exaggerated style, consistent with animated characterization.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ogre in Image B features an oversized cape that fits the exaggerated and playful style, with a notable fluffy fur trim that gives it a comical and over-the-top appearance. This is a common stylization in cartoons, contrasting with the original's potentially more grounded and less exaggerated attire.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible torn or tattered clothing elements; the attire is clean and evenly styled to match the cartoon aesthetic. This contrasts with Image A's depiction, where the clothing might appear worn and rugged, in line with the original realistic design.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre is indeed standing on a base that simulates rocks, and there is an engraved plaque with clear text stating “Mighty Ogre.” These elements contribute to the toy-like, collectible feel of the image, confirming the presence of these features.",
