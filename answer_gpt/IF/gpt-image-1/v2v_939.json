      "question": "Is the character depicted in a cute chibi-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has exaggerated features such as a larger head and body proportions that are typically associated with chibi-style art. The character's form appears rounded and cartoonish, contributing to a 3D appearance. This style is known for its cuteness, often used to depict characters in an endearing and playful manner.",
