      "question": "Are there exactly five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four visible chibi-style Russian nesting dolls lined next to each other. The visual examination shows four distinct dolls standing in a line from the largest to the smallest. Therefore, based on this observation, there are not exactly five dolls.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a vibrant lime-green color and texture similar to the shoe and tennis ball in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style nesting dolls have a vibrant lime-green color and a slightly pebbled texture. Comparing this to Image A, both the shoe and tennis ball also exhibit a similar vibrant lime-green color and texture. Hence, the nesting dolls in Image B indeed share a similar color and texture characteristic to those items in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from largest to smallest in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are arranged sequentially from left to right in descending order, starting with the largest doll on the far left and the smallest doll on the far right. This is a logical and common way to display nesting dolls, as it highlights the size difference. Therefore, they are organized from largest to smallest.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nesting dolls resting on a surface that has a brown color with visible wood grain patterns, indicating that it is a wooden table. The appearance and texture suggest a reasonably elegant and refined wooden surface. Thus, the dolls are indeed positioned on a sophisticated wooden table.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of the image subtle and non-distracting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a simple, solid color that does not compete with the subject for attention. It's neutral and soft, which ensures that the focus remains on the nesting dolls. This makes it subtle and non-distracting, fulfilling the requirement for such a background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if Image B maintains a 3:2 aspect ratio, one must evaluate the width in relation to its height. While direct measurement is not possible via visual assessment alone, the image's shape and layout suggest a nearly square composition rather than a 3:2 horizontal rectangle typical in photography. Therefore, it does not appear to maintain a 3:2 aspect ratio.",
