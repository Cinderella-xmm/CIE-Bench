      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding elements exhibit clear geometric contours and segmented areas resembling stained glass panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree and landscape elements are divided into sections by bold, dark lines with distinct colors filling each segment. This is characteristic of stained glass artwork, where individual-colored glass pieces are separated by lead cames. The visual style is not organic but rather structured into clear geometric patterns and contours typical of stained glass design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the treeâ€™s branches composed of angular, geometric shapes rather than organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches of the tree are stylized into a series of angular and geometric shapes. Unlike natural trees that have irregular and organic curves, these branches are simplified into distinct, repeated patterns that reflect the structured aesthetic seen in stained glass art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the grass rendered in desaturated, low-saturation colors consistent with a muted palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors of the grass in Image B are strong and feature vibrant hues, typical of stained glass art, rather than muted or desaturated tones. The stained glass aesthetic uses bold colors to allow light to pass through effectively, which contradicts a muted palette. Therefore, the grass is not in desaturated colors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mountains depicted with sharp, angular forms and colored in shades of bronze and teal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted with geometric, angular forms, consistent with the style of stained glass artwork. The colors used include shades of bronze and teal, which complement the warm tones in stained glass color schemes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient and include visible accentuated lines or decorative patterns that convey vintage elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is not rendered with a smooth gradient but rather includes segmented, flat-colored areas bound with lines typical of stained glass. These lines create a decorative pattern. While the composition is vintage in style, it's more characteristic of stained glass rather than featuring a soft gradient.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the elements in the image composed of flat, solid-colored regions bounded by dark, defined lines characteristic of stained glass art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes flat, solid colors for each segment of the image, bounded by thick, dark lines. This stylistic choice is typical of stained glass art, which involves arranging colored glass pieces defined by lines created by lead cames. This method outlines the structure clearly, characteristic of stained glass.",
