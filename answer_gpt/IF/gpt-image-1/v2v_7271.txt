    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene, including the laundromat and the person holding laundry, depicted using Lego bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, every element, including the walls of the laundromat, the doors, washing machines, the person, and the laundry, has the characteristic blocky geometry and interlocking parts typical of Lego bricks. These visual cues suggest that the scene is constructed entirely from Lego pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the person and the folded laundry represented as Lego figures and objects?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a figure composed of blocky parts with clear interlocking sections and angular design, characteristics that align with Lego figures. The folded laundry also has a simplistic, block-like appearance consistent with Lego models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the laundromat environment, including the walls, doors, and washing machines, constructed using Lego bricks?",
    "explanation": "All components of the laundromat in Image B, such as the brick walls, doors, and the interior washing machines, display the typical geometric style and connecting features associated with Lego constructions. This suggests that they are all made from Lego bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the scene have a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama?",
    "explanation": "The arrangement of elements in Image B, including the figures and laundromat environment, presents a structured and unmoving appearance, characteristic of stop-motion dioramas which often use Lego bricks for their static and crafted aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the overall scene composition been maintained while adapting it to the Lego aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the layout of major elements like the position of the person and the laundromat, as well as their proportions relative to each other, remain consistent despite the adaptation into Lego form. This indicates that the scene composition is preserved in the transition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
