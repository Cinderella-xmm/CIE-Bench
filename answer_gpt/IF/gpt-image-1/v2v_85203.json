      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is visually transformed into an ethereal shape resembling an energetic vortex.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows what appear to be trails extending outwards from the butterfly's wing-like shapes. These trails are indicative of light or energy being emitted, which can be interpreted as faint trails of light.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the scene depicts a dark mass with visual characteristics similar to a chasm. The surface textures and lighting suggest a glossy appearance, akin to obsidian. This impression is reinforced by the rugged, broken appearance of the mass, resembling a fractured surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B conveys an otherworldly, mystical feel. The swirling lines, the contrast of the dark tones with the bright blues, and the overall lack of clear, definite shapes create a nebulous and surreal atmosphere, making it appear enveloped in a mystical ambience.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly-like figure in Image B is situated above the dark mass with trails connecting to it, indicating a position of hovering. The spatial arrangement and depiction suggest that the butterfly is not directly on the dark surface but positioned above it, enhancing the floating appearance.",
