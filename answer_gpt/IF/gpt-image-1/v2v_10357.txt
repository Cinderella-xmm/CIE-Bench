    "Question 1": "Does the teddy bear have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear clearly exhibits a geometric, faceted appearance, typical of low-poly rendering. This style uses flat planes and sharp angles to create a simplified yet recognizable form, distinctively different from the smooth texture seen in non-low-poly images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question 2": "Does the motorcycle have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
    "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B presents a similar faceted, angular design characterized by geometric shapes and flat polygons, typical of low-poly styles. This approach contrasts with the more continuous and smooth lines of conventional designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question 3": "Is the scenic background rendered in a low-poly style while still being recognizable?",
    "explanation": "The landscape in Image B, including the mountain and water body, is depicted using geometric facets and polygons, indicative of a low-poly style. Despite the simplified shapes, the iconic mountain remains identifiable, showcasing the balance between abstraction and recognition in low-poly rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question 4": "Has the teddy bear retained its original pose and position?",
    "explanation": "Despite the stylistic change to a low-poly appearance in Image B, the teddy bear's pose and position on the motorcycle remain consistent with Image A, as evident from its posture and grip on the handlebars.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question 5": "Has the motorcycle retained its original design and position?",
    "explanation": "While the motorcycle's appearance in Image B is adjusted to a low-poly style, its overall design and positioning remain unchanged from Image A. This is apparent through the unchanged proportions and orientation relative to the bear and background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
