      "question": "Is the doll figure rendered in an oil painting style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that the entire image, including the background, is depicted with a smudged, textured appearance typically associated with oil painting. The details around the doll figure are less defined, with broad strokes and a blending of colors, which are characteristics of the oil painting style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct presence of warm tones such as yellows, oranges, and browns especially in the areas that encompass the doll figure and the wooden stump. This creates an overall warm ambiance typical in such artistic renditions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doll figure and the wooden stump exhibit a texture that suggests an artistic effect, potentially resembling brush strokes and canvas texture. This is more obvious when the details are less defined and appear to have an impasto effect.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],

      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the doll figure and the wooden stump are less sharp and defined compared to typical photographic clarity. Instead, they exhibit a blending effect, where colors and boundaries mesh smoothly, which is characteristic of an oil painting style.",
