      "question": "Is the bowl made of a transparent glass-like material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the material of the bowl in Image B, we observe the structural and visual cues suggesting transparency. The bowl's edges and the visibility of the vegetables through the bowl indicate a glass-like material. Glass is known for its transparency, allowing objects inside to be seen clearly.",

      "question": "Do the vegetables have a fresh and slightly damp surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing the surface of the vegetables in Image B, we notice a shiny quality that often accompanies moisture or freshness. The brightness and clarity of the colors contribute to an impression of liveliness, which is commonly associated with fresh produce, as vegetables tend to appear slightly damp when freshly cut.",

      "question": "Does the image show angled lighting from above with soft ambient fill, creating highlights and soft shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the lighting appears to come from above and slightly to the left, creating subtle highlights on the cauliflower and carrots. Shadows are present but soft, indicating ambient fill light in addition to the main directional light, which contributes to the overall smooth and balanced illumination.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is observed as a smooth neutral gray. There is a gradient effect present, suggesting a vignette that subtly directs focus towards the center. This type of background is common in professional food photography to draw attention to the subject without distraction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases vegetables with bright and vivid colors, indicative of freshness. The lighting enhances this natural vibrancy, giving them a soft glow that makes the colors pop more than usual. This effect is often achieved through controlled lighting and possibly post-processing to emphasize freshness.",
