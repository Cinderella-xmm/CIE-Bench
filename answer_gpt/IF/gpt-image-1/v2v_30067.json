    {

      "question": "Have the visible cracks and broken areas on the clock tower been restored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower appears smooth and intact with no visible cracks or broken areas, indicating a successful restoration. Whereas, a clock tower with visible cracks and broken areas would typically display signs of wear and tear, such as fractures and missing sections, which are absent in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any gaps or missing parts left unfilled on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clock tower that is completely filled and whole, with no detectable gaps or missing parts. Visually, a fully restored structure lacks the holes or voids that are evident when parts are missing.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the restored parts match the original texture and color of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower's surface is uniform in both texture and color, suggesting the restoration process has made the structure homogeneous. The consistent texture and color indicate an effort to align with the original or a well-integrated new design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the restored clock tower maintain the original architectural style and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a clock tower that retains classic architectural elements like the pointed arches and spires, typical of historical clock towers, suggesting the preservation of the original style and details post-restoration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Is the clock face intact and legible after the restoration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B is clear and visible, with unbroken elements and distinct Roman numerals, allowing for easy reading. This indicates that the clock face is intact and legible.",
