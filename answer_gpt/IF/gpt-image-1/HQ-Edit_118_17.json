      "question": "Is the stave church enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible structural framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stave church is clearly enclosed within a transparent glass display case. The structural framing is visible, especially the wooden borders that outline the edges of the glass panels. This suggests that the church is intended to be viewed as a miniaturized display piece within a protective casing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small-scale coniferous trees are deliberately positioned around the base of the display case, giving the appearance of a miniature landscape surrounding the stave church model. The presence of these scaled-down trees is consistent with the construction of a diorama or display model.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows mountains rendered with a muted, desaturated color palette that emphasizes a peaceful and low-contrast look. This typical muted tone is often achieved by using subdued colors to create a harmonious and less vibrant background.",
