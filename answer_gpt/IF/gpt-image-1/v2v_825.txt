    "Question": "Q1: Are the calendar pages arranged into a tidy pile?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the calendar pages neatly stacked in a pile. This is evident from the alignment of the edges of the pages and the lack of overlapping or scattered arrangement, which suggests tidiness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates still present and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the calendar for January features handwritten notes such as 'Birthday' below the 2nd day, which is circled. However, other months are not visible, making it impossible to verify if all notes and highlights remain unchanged as the context in Image A cannot inform about this detail. Thus, without Image A for comparisons, a definitive answer isn't possible based on Image B alone.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the calendar pages and desk surface display convincing textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the calendar pages both smooth and matte, suggests the feel of new paper. The wooden desk also features grains typical of wood surfaces. These are consistent with real-life textures, providing a convincing depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there evidence of lighting and shadow depth creating a realistic appearance?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a light source that creates soft shadows under the calendars, giving a sense of depth between the pages and the desk surface. This shadowing contributes to a realistic representation by suggesting three-dimensional space and volume.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the colors and styles of the handwritten notes and highlighted dates been preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors and styles of handwriting, such as blue for 'Birthday', remain consistent with the original style. However, due to incomplete visibility of all months, it's uncertain if all notes like 'Wedding' or 'No work' from Image A are unchanged without referring to them directly.",
    "answer": "No"
