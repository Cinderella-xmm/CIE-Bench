      "question": "Is the car and coastal road enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible edges and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows visible edges of what appears to be a display case. The glass's reflections and the demarcation lines along the edges confirm that the car and the coastal road are enclosed within a transparent glass display case. The reflections on the glass indicate its transparency and the case's boundaries.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car exhibit metallic red coloring with visible gradient hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car maintains a distinctly metallic red appearance. Based on the lighting and shading seen in the image, it exhibits gradient hues from darker shades to brighter reflections, suggesting a metallic finish. Metallic paints often reflect varying colors under light, creating gradients that highlight the car’s surfaces and contours.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines present on the car’s bodywork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car with pronounced curves and aerodynamic lines that contribute to the dynamic aesthetic characteristic of a sports car. These sharp lines and curves are visually present and enhance the car's bodywork, reflecting the design typical of high-performance vehicles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the road and cliffs, there is visible stratification indicating layered construction, resembling a diorama layout often found in resin models. The appearance of depth and the apparent layered structure in the landscape suggest it is depicted as a resin crafted display with visible stratification.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the scene is detailed, the surfaces of the road and cliffs don’t clearly reveal distinct micro gravel textures. The textures seem smooth and streamlined rather than granular as micro gravel would typically appear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible sunset forms the backdrop of the scene encased within the display case, but there is no indication that the sky panel is specifically positioned at the top of the case as part of the upper boundary. It is part of the background scene rather than a top panel.",
