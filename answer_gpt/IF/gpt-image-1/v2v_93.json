      "question": "Is the thermometer depicted in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall look of the thermometer, along with the surrounding elements, such as the banner and nameplate, is stylized in a way that resembles 3D rendering commonly seen in cartoons or digital graphics. The exaggerated features and smooth shading enhance this perception, which aligns with the characteristics of a 3D cartoon style representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image use soft lighting to highlight the thermometer's metallic finish and clearly visible dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is depicted with shading and highlights that suggest a soft lighting effect. However, the style is more illustrative and the focus seems to be on the stylized, cartoonish aspect rather than an accurate representation of metallic textures and realistic lighting. The lighting doesn't serve to create a realistic metallic finish as it would in a photograph.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] clearly incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly contains text displaying 'TEMPERATURE RANGE +200' and 'ACCURACY +10°C' prominently at the bottom of the frame, where it is easily noticeable, and thus these stats are clearly incorporated into the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top of the layout, there is a banner with a stylized design that contains the words 'PRECISION THERMAL GAUGE,' ensuring it meets the criteria for a title banner with the specified label.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a section at the bottom that resembles a nameplate featuring the text 'Thermometer,' effectively serving as an identifying label for the device.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is in a blue shade, which is typically associated with professionalism and subtly enhances the theme of scientific precision. Blue tones are often used in scientific and technical graphics to convey a sense of calm, precision, and reliability.",
