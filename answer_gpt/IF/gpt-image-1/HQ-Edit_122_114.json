      "question": "Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stork's feathers are clearly depicted with metallic plates, which appear to be riveted or segmented. This visual cue, indicative of a mechanical or industrial interpretation, supports the notion that the natural feathers have been substituted with metal, consistent with elements typical in Steampunk design, which often incorporates metal and mechanical textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the nest as made of cogs, gears, and other mechanical parts, serving as a clear substitution for the natural twigs seen in a traditional nest. This transformation is visually apparent and aligns with Steampunk aesthetics, which frequently involves reimagining organic materials as mechanical constructs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features copper-colored pipes integrated along the roofline of the house. These pipes are noticeable due to their metallic hue, which fits the Steampunk theme that often uses copper or brass elements to evoke an industrial, retro-futuristic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stork is depicted with visible mechanical joints at key limb connections such as the legs and neck. These joints are represented as metal components, suggesting articulation and movement typical of machinery rather than biological anatomy, fitting well within a mechanized Steampunk aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a scene saturated in Steampunk design elements, including mechanical components like gears and pipes, metallic textures on the stork and house, and industrial design features. These visual cues create a consistent Steampunk theme across the entire setting, emphasizing the blend of retro machinery and fantastical steam-powered technology.",
