      "question": "Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse appears to have a smooth and shiny surface with a glass-like appearance, indicative of a hard material like glass rather than the soft textures typically associated with plush fabric. This is evidenced by the way light reflects on its surface, which is characteristic of glass rather than fabric.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the seahorse is depicted as having a translucent pink appearance.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The belly section of the seahorse in Image B is shown as a yellow area suggesting glass material properties due to its reflective surface. A music note design appears etched or embossed on the belly, which is consistent with designs that can be applied to glass surfaces through etching techniques.",
