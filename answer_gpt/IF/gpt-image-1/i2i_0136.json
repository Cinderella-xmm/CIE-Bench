      "question": "Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted has characteristics commonly associated with keychains: it has a compact, flat shape with a recognizable design for a citrus fruit, and an attachment ring for adding it to keys. The rigid, polished appearance indicates it's made from a manufactured material like rubber or plastic, distinguishing it from the irregular and natural texture of an actual fruit. These visual cues support the conclusion that the object is a rubber keychain.",

      "question": "Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain includes a small, stylized green component resembling an orange stem. This is part of the design, whereas in a natural fruit, the stem is a part of the organic structure. This stylized representation allows the keychain to retain the visual element of the original orange's stem, supporting the conclusion that the stem is retained, albeit in a synthetic form.",

      "question": "Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the keychain with a shiny surface that mimics the glossy appearance found on the external peel of a fresh orange, as seen in Image A. Despite being a manufactured item, the surface of the rubber keychain is designed to mimic the smooth, reflective surface of the fruit, thus maintaining the glossy texture from the original orange.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the keychain visually recognizable as a citrus fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B uses several visual elements to resemble a citrus fruit: the circular shape, the orange color, and the texture resembling the peel of an orange. These are all visual indicators that commonly identify a citrus fruit like an orange. Therefore, based on these visual cues, the keychain is visually recognizable as representing a citrus fruit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain include a visible attachment point like a ring or clip for keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear attachment point ­— a metal ring — connected to the keychain, which enables the object to be attached to a set of keys. This metal loop is the standard inclusion in a keychain for functionality, thus confirming the presence of a visible attachment point.",
