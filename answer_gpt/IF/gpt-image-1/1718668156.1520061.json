      "question": "Is the tall ice tower in the foreground rendered with pixelated textures and visible circuit-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall ice tower displays a pixelated texture with visible squares on its surface, resembling the digital or circuit-like patterns commonly seen in video game graphics or digital art. This style gives it a modern and technological aesthetic, which does not appear in the traditional appearance of objects in real life.",

      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House represented using glowing neon lines instead of solid surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House is depicted with glowing neon lines that outline its distinctive architectural forms, rather than portraying them with solid surfaces and traditional materials. This representation fits the digital aesthetic, often used in futuristic or cyberpunk themes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves in the ocean composed of geometric shapes rather than realistic water ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waves in the ocean in Image B are composed of geometric shapes, represented as structured lines and grids, which deviate from the typical organic and fluid depiction of water. This geometric pattern aligns with the digital and futuristic style observed in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the drink on the left appear as a transparent, floating hologram with visible depth and light distortion effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drink on the left is illustrated with bright neon highlights, giving it a transparency effect mimicking holograms, evident in the light distortion and apparent depth. Such visuals are characteristic of digital representations in virtual environments.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a unified futuristic digital aesthetic, with all elements (ice tower, Opera House, ocean, drink) transformed according to their specified styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire scene in Image B is transformed into a futuristic digital aesthetic, characterized by neon lines, pixelated textures, and geometric shapes for the elements including the ice tower, Sydney Opera House, ocean, and drink. This cohesive aesthetic aligns with the visual motifs used in cyberpunk or digital-themed artwork.",
