      "question": "Has the original book illustration been replaced with a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a snow globe featuring a book with open pages inside it. This is a distinct contrast from Image A, which shows a flat illustration of an open book. The presence of the snow globe is evident with its usual dome-like glass structure enclosing the book, indicating that the book illustration has indeed been replaced with a snow globe.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is clearly positioned on what appears to be a wooden shelf, and there are discernible book spines surrounding it on both sides. The presence of the books alongside the snow globe suggests a traditional setting for bookshelves.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the background of Image B, a blurred lamp can be seen emitting a warm golden light. The light interacts with the glass of the snow globe, creating sparkles within it, which is a typical result of light diffraction or reflection through glass surfaces.",

      "question": "Inside the snow globe, is the book depicted as a compact, chibi-style 3D model with fluttering pages in a snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe in Image B, the book is represented as a small three-dimensional model, which could be interpreted as chibi-style due to its compact nature and simplicity. The snow globe environment adds the element of falling white particles, giving the effect of a snowy environment. However, the pages are not shown as fluttering, but the setup within the snow globe evokes a scene that's quite detailed.",
