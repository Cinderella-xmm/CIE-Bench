      "question": "Is the title \"Bali's Majestic Legacy\" clearly displayed on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no title 'Bali's Majestic Legacy' visible anywhere. The image consists of illustrations and informative text about Balinese dance and architecture, but no such title is presented. Typically, such a title would be prominently displayed to give context to the entire composition, but since it's missing, the conclusion is clear.",

      "question": "Does the dancer's dress feature intricate golden batik patterns and vibrant red colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's dress is illustrated in a sepia tone that gives a traditional, vintage look and does not exhibit vibrant colors. Batik designs typically involve detailed patterns but the sepia treatment maintains uniformity in tone, leaving no room for vibrant reds or intricate golden patterns to be visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the temple rendered in a line-drawn style using sepia tones instead of realistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a temple and surrounding elements rendered in a line-drawn style distinguished by the sepia color tone. This style often mimics archival or historical illustrations, differing from realistic, colored renderings and is clearly different from Image A's colorful depiction, substantiating this observation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the temple centered in the composition, with the mythical creatures placed symmetrically on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition indeed shows the temple structured centrally, with mythical creatures flanking it symmetrically on each side. This symmetry is a common practice when depicting traditional architecture to draw attention to the central element, reiterating the temple's prominence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there blocks of informative text about Balinese dance and architecture written in elegant serif fonts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear blocks of text providing information on Balinese dance and architecture. The text is written in a serif font, which is commonly used to convey elegance and readability in printed materials or formal contexts, corroborating this observation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the visual elements (dress, headdress, dance pose, temple design, and mythical creatures) reflect authentic Balinese cultural symbols and traditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though Image B employs sepia tones, which render the visual elements in a more artistic or antique manner, the components like the dress style, headdress, temple architecture, dance pose, and mythical creatures do reflect identifiable Balinese cultural symbols. These elements, although stylized, retain the thematic integrity characteristic of Balinese culture.",
