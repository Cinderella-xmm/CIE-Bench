      "question": "Is the cow depicted in a stylized 3D chibi art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow features exaggerated proportions typical of chibi style, such as a large head, big eyes, and small body. These elements combined with the 3D rendering align with a stylized chibi art style. My reasoning is based on recognizing the unique characteristics of chibi art style, which are evident in the visual cues such as the cow's expression and design.",

      "question": "Does the cow retain its original black-and-white coat patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cow has distinct black spots and patches on a primarily white coat, consistent with the original cow's coat pattern in Image A, albeit in a stylized form. The visual cues from Image B show black and white distribution similar to Holstein cows, supporting the conclusion that the original pattern is retained.",

      "question": "Is the cow leaning against the vintage television with both front hooves placed atop the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow's two front hooves are visible atop the television in front of its body, which appears to be leaning on the television. This positioning suggests the cow is interacting with the television by placing both hooves on it. Image A shows the cow standing behind the television, providing contrast but affirming Image B's positioning as deliberate interaction.",

      "question": "Does the cow sport a mischievous grin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cow in Image B has exaggerated facial features, including a large smile that appears mischievous due to its curved and pronounced shape. These stylistic elements, typical in animated and playful depictions, communicate a lighthearted and mischievous expression. Image A does not depict such an expression, supporting the clarity of Image B's smile.",

      "question": "Is the scene set in a grassy field with a bright sky and a few 3D-modeled clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the cow and vintage television amidst grass, with a bright sky and 3D-modeled clouds in the background. The clouds have a distinct rounded shape typical of 3D animation, and the field setting matches typical outdoor depictions, consistent with Image A's outdoor field setting. Analyzing both confirms the setting choice.",
