      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the entire scene been reimagined as a vintage stationery set packaging design rather than a realistic library interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is explicitly labeled 'VINTAGE STATIONERY SET' which indicates that the concept is centered around a packaging design for a stationery set. The inclusion of text and the specific arrangement of items normally associated with stationery (like a pen and paper) suggest that this is a representation rather than a real scene, distinguishing it from Image A's realistic library setup.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ornate desk styled as a decorative box base with visible embossed wood textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an ornate desk styled with intricate carvings and a surface that resembles a decorative box base, emphasizing embossing that mimics wooden textures. This contrasts the more realistic depiction of a library desk in Image A. The embossed style in Image B suggests a packaging design often associated with luxury items.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the open book been replaced with a writing pad made of antique-style paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is not an open book but instead a writing pad with sheets that have an antique appearance. This is different from the open book seen in Image A, indicating a shift in focus from a book for reading to a pad for writing, fitting the stationery theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the quill depicted as a gold foil embossed logo on the packaging or box surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of Image B features an embossed quill design that stands out as a decorative element, suggesting it is part of the packaging's branding or design, rather than a functional object like in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small ink bottle placed on top of the desk or packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small ink bottle labeled 'ELEGANCE' is placed prominently on the writing pad or packaging surface. This element is not present in Image A, which focuses more on the intricacies of the library setup itself, not specific stationery items.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any visible brand details etched along the spine of the writing pad. The design is more focused on the display of the writing set and its components, with branding elements, if any, likely incorporated into the overall surface decoration rather than the spine area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall design convey elegance through refined materials, balanced composition, and classical styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed with a strong emphasis on elegance. The use of refined colors, balanced composition, and ornate, classical elements like the embossed textures and choice of a quill and ink suggest a sophisticated design approach. This is intended to convey luxury and classical aesthetics, aligning with the theme of a vintage stationery set.",
