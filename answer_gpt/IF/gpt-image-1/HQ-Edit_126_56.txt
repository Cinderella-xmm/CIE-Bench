    "Question": "Q1: Are the mountains rendered as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces instead of realistic contours?",
    "Explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted using geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces, reflecting a stylized interpretation rather than realistic contours. This is evident from the clean lines and angular forms that characterize the mountain peaks, typical of certain artistic styles such as Art Deco or Cubism, where natural forms are simplified into geometric shapes.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the trees depicted as geometric forms, such as triangular or stepped shapes, with no realistic leaf details?",
    "Explanation": "The trees in Image B are represented as geometric forms, primarily using circular and triangular shapes, without incorporating realistic leaf details. The stylization involves simplifying natural forms into recognizable, abstract shapes, aligning with the design principles of geometric art where detailed organic textures are omitted for simplicity.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the river composed of a series of radiating parallel lines rather than a continuous, reflective body of water?",
    "Explanation": "Image B presents the river with radiating parallel lines, creating a stylized representation instead of depicting a continuous, reflective body of water. This approach uses linear perspective and geometric abstraction to convey the idea of water, diverging from natural fluid forms and embracing an Art Deco style.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are all elements in the image outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors?",
    "Explanation": "In Image B, all elements are outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors, indicative of a graphic and geometric art style. This can be observed in the clear delineation of shapes and the distinct color blocking that avoids gradients or soft transitions typically found in more realistic renderings.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the reflection in the water a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements?",
    "Explanation": "Image B shows the reflection in the water as a perfectly symmetrical, geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements. This symmetrical approach reflects a deliberate artistic choice to emphasize balance and harmony, using geometry to create a clear visual rhythm between the elements and their reflections.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there any visible gradients or soft shading in the sky, mountains, or water, or are all areas filled with flat, solid colors?",
    "Explanation": "In Image B, all areas, including the sky, mountains, and water, are filled with flat, solid colors without any gradients or soft shading. This technique is common in stylized art, where solid color blocks contribute to a bold and striking visual impact, consistent with the Art Deco design principles.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the image use a vibrant, high-contrast color palette typical of Art Deco design, including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black?",
    "Explanation": "Image B employs a vibrant, high-contrast color palette, characteristic of Art Deco design, with bold hues such as red, gold, blue, and black. This choice of colors enhances the visual appeal and communicates the thematic boldness associated with the Art Deco movement, known for its rich and striking design elements.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
