      "question": "Does the edited image show the smartwatch transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon with dragon-like anatomy integrated into the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction is of a lone dragon's head and upper body rather than a transformation of a smartwatch into a cybernetic wrist with integrated dragon-like anatomy. The dragon's anatomy consists of a detailed head and part of the body, not evident on a wrist-like structure. Therefore, the visual cues do not suggest a transformation of the smartwatch into this form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the watch face replaced with a radiant, multi-layered holographic dragon eye featuring glowing elements and depth effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a dragon with a prominent, multi-layered eye that possesses radiant colors and depth effects, akin to holographics. This contrasts with Image A's watch face, which shows traditional app icons. The dragon's eye replaces the functionality and appearance of a watch face through artistic transformation.",

      "question": "Are the original silicone band and its contours replaced with a series of interlocking, metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction includes a dragon's anatomy with metallic scales. However, these scales do not cover a wrist portion as there is no depiction of a wrist in Image B, unlike Image A's silicone smartwatch band. The transformation does not indicate that the wrist portion is covered by these scales.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the digital crown been replaced with a glowing, spherical neural node emitting light or energy pulses, resembling a biotech interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a digital crown like Image A. Instead, the dragon design includes a glowing eye and other elements in its anatomy. There is no spherical neural node evident in Image B resembling a biotech interface emitting light or energy pulses in place of a digital crown.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original app icons on the watch face replaced with glowing, rune-like control sigils that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits glowing symbols or patterns on the dragonâ€™s body that resemble rune-like control sigils, contrasting with Image A's standard app icons on the watch face. These elements in the dragon image align with a tech-magic aesthetic, representing a transformed interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic form with visual cues such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon depicted in Image B appears static with detailed textures but lacks elements that suggest motion like energy flow or motion lines. The posture seems stable rather than conveying active movement or life, unlike what might be expected from a dynamic form.",
