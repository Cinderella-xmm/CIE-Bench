      "question": "Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bears appear to be made from a mosaic pattern consisting of small, colorful tiles that resemble the texture of fur. This is evident by the consistent use of tile-like patterns all over the teddy bears' bodies, which suggest a mosaic-style rendering. The tiles are arranged in a way that simulates the natural contours and texture typical of a teddy bear's fur.",

      "question": "Have the knitted sweaters been replaced with intricate tile patterns in yellow and turquoise hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teddy bears wearing sweaters, which are depicted in a mosaic style using yellow and turquoise tiles. This interpretation comes from the distinct appearance of the sweaters; they have tile patterns instead of knitted textures. The use of tiles creates a segmented appearance similar to intricate mosaic work, indicating that the sweaters have been replaced with such patterns.",

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, snout) recreated using subtly shaded tiles to provide detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the teddy bears, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and snout, are rendered using tiles. The shading and arrangement of tiles provide detail and depth to these features, creating a three-dimensional appearance. This suggests the use of subtly shaded tiles to capture the intricacies of the teddy bear's facial features effectively.",

      "question": "Do the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles that contrast with the mosaic texture of the rest of the bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows on the teddy bears are rendered using smooth, glossy tiles that differ from the mosaic texture seen on the rest of the bears' bodies. The tiles forming the bows are shiny and sleek, providing a contrast with the textured mosaic tiles that depict the fur. This choice of texture makes the bows stand out visually against the mosaic pattern.",

      "question": "Are the mosaic bears positioned on a minimalistic white pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the two mosaic teddy bears sitting on what appears to be a simple, white pedestal. The minimalistic design of the pedestal contrasts with the intricate mosaic pattern of the bears, accentuating their detailed textures and colors. The white pedestal serves as a neutral background that highlights the vibrant patterns of the mosaic bears.",
