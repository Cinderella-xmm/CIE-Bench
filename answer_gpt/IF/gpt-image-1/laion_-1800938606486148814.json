      "question": "Has the shoe upper been replaced with a transparent material that reveals intricate circuitry patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe upper visually appears as if it has been replaced with a material that displays intricate circuitry patterns, suggesting a futuristic design. This is indicative of a design choice rather than an actual transparent material, as conveying the circuitry externally gives a tech-inspired aesthetic. World knowledge about futuristic designs often includes such motifs for aesthetic appeal. Hence, this visual cue aligns with the idea of replacing the exterior with a transparent look showing circuitry.",

      "question": "Does the Swoosh logo emit a cool neon blue glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Swoosh logo on the sneaker is clearly emitting a cool neon blue glow, standing out prominently against the darker background and shoe material. This effect aligns with design elements often used to convey a modern, cybernetic look. Such a glow is absent in more traditional shoe designs but is typical in visual representations of futuristic or high-tech themes.",

      "question": "Is there a small digital screen attached to the strap that displays dynamic animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the strap of the shoe, there is an object resembling a digital screen, consistent with what could be a small LED or digital screen. While the specific dynamic nature of the animations cannot be directly observed from a static image, the design of the screen suggests the potential for dynamic visuals, characteristic of technological advancements and futuristic design cues.",

      "question": "Is there a collapsible digital shoe box with a metallic finish and holographic branding visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe is placed next to a box that features a strong visual neon blue glow and futuristic design, possibly indicating some holographic or digital branding with a modern finish. The box's appearance, with lines and edge designs, implies a metallic or high-tech finish typically associated with collapsible digital technologies. Thus, visual cues suggest the presence of a futuristic shoe box with such characteristics.",

      "question": "Are modern geometric patterns visible on the surface of the digital shoe box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital shoe box exhibits surface designs that look like geometric patterns. These patterns include intersecting lines and shapes commonly associated with modern digital or technological designs, suggesting the intended aesthetic of futuristic technology. Such geometry is often symbolic of high-tech or cyber design themes.",

      "question": "Does the sneaker retain its original structural proportions and silhouette despite the futuristic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, despite the significant modifications like the glow and circuitry pattern, the overall silhouette, and structural proportions of the sneaker remain consistent. The outline of the shoe, including the sole and upper shape, appears to remain unchanged, indicating that the modifications are primarily cosmetic and do not alter the fundamental construction of the sneaker.",
