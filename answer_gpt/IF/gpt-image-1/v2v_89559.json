      "question": "Have the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos been transformed into stylized, gleaming golden award statuettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos are depicted as 3D golden statuettes, indicating they have been transformed from flat logos into physical award representations. Visual cues, such as the gold color and the 3D structure complete with bases, suggest that they are designed to resemble trophies or awards.",

      "question": "Has the background been changed to a rich, dark velvet curtain, replacing the original green background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the background as a deep, dark material that resembles velvet curtains, differing from the solid green background in Image A. The texture and color suggest a more luxurious and dramatic backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 'Sumo Digital' logo rendered as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Sumo Digital' logo appears as a round emblem integrated into the base of the 'Rising Star' statuette, which looks like a polished wooden block. This differs from the position and style of the logo in Image A, where it appears as part of a flat graphic. The elements suggest an embossed look on a wooden base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text presented in elegant, engraved silver lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text for 'Character Art Directory 2018' is styled in a way that mimics engraved lettering, but the material appears to be gold rather than silver, matching the overall gold theme of the statuettes. Image A shows the text in a flat white color. Therefore, the material of the lettering in Image B is not silver.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the structural integrity of the original image been maintained while applying the specified changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B has undergone several stylistic changes, such as transforming logos into gold statuettes and altering the background, the basic structure of having two main logos and the text remains. However, the nature of these transformations (2D to 3D, flat to textured) indicates a significant change in visual presentation rather than mere superficial adjustments.",
