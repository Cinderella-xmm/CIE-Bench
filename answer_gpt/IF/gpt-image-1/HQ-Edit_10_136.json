      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a cartoonized style with exaggerated features and an enlarged strumming hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate a cartoonized style as the girl has simplified details, rounded shapes, and exaggerated features, like the prominently enlarged strumming hand, which is a common trait in cartoon illustrations. This design approach uses exaggeration to emphasize action or character traits which aligns with the visual cues.",

      "question": "Are the wall posters enhanced with vibrant band logos rendered in a watercolor style, showing visible brushwork and color diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posters on the wall feature bright band logos like 'Nirvana,' 'The Beatles,' and 'Fleetwood Mac.'

The colors are flat and uniform, indicative of digital or flat illustration methods rather than watercolor.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
