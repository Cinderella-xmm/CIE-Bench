      "question": "Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes extend from its body into the surrounding environment, creating a seamless pattern that suggests integration between the zebra and the ground. This design choice implies that the elements of the zebra and its surroundings are intentionally blended, conceptually altering the scene to connect the living creature with the pattern on the ground.",

      "question": "Is the grassland rendered in a black-and-white striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a surreal alteration where the grassland is rendered as a black-and-white striped pattern that mirrors the zebra's own stripes. The entire scene, including the area where the grass would normally be, is covered in a continuous pattern that resembles the zebraâ€™s distinctive stripes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image adopts a surrealistic style by fusing the zebra's stripes seamlessly with the environment. The use of this imaginative and continuous striped pattern across both the animal and the ground transforms the ordinary natural scene into one that invites the viewer to perceive a visual illusion, typical of surrealism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the zebra's stripes and the pattern extending into the grass is smooth and continuous, without any abrupt breaks or interruptions. This seamless integration suggests a deliberate design choice in creating an uninterrupted flow between the zebra and its environment.",

      "question": "Has the zebra's original body proportion been maintained despite the extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a normally proportioned zebra without any unusual extensions or alterations. Image B retains the original body proportions of the zebra, even though its stripes blend into the environment. The zebra's physical anatomy in terms of size and proportion appears unchanged despite the altered artistic representation.",
