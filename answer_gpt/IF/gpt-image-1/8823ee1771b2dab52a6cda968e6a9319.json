      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure now depicted as a ceramic doll rather than a living person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure displays characteristics typical of a ceramic doll, such as a porcelain-like texture, a glossy surface, and the appearance of being crafted rather than alive. The hands and the rest of the body have a smooth, polished finish, suggesting a solid material rather than a living being. World knowledge on ceramic figurines confirms this depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the gown made of soft pastel blue porcelain with visible silver detailing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown in Image B has a pastel blue color with a glaze that imitates porcelain. The light sheen is consistent with porcelain material, and while there is a silvery appearance visible along certain parts of the decoration, it complements the blue porcelain look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral embellishments present on the gown in a manner consistent with porcelain decoration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral embellishments are raised and smoothly integrated into the gown's surface, resembling how decorations are often applied to porcelain items, with a cohesive and structured appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figurine leaning against a miniature ornate column?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the figure with one arm resting on a small, detailed column which appears to be made of the same ceramic material, confirming it is a miniature version typical in porcelain figurines.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a glossy mantle surface adjacent to the column that matches the style and finish of the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base includes a structure adjacent to the column, but it doesn't resemble a mantle with a glossy finish extending away in Image B as seen in porcelain decor. The imaginary style doesn't include an extensive mantle surface; the column doesnâ€™t lead to another distinct piece like in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B appears to be simply a wooden or solid color finish without any detailed painting or complex depiction of a scene, focusing on simplicity typical for supporting a figurine.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there polished gold accents visible on the base or within the parlor scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No visible gold accents are present in Image B's base or background. The surface is absent of any metallic or gilded details typically found in decorated porcelain items.",

      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the same leaning posture with one arm resting on the column as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images exhibit an identical pose where the figure leans against the column with one arm stretched out, signifying a direct posture transfer from Image A to Image B.",

      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a uniform glossy finish and texture throughout the figurine's surface, characteristic of a porcelain material, indicating attention to the porcelain look.",

      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Does the figurine retain the facial features and expression of the original woman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B have been intentionally blurred, making it impossible to determine if they match those of the original image. Thus, it is not possible to state that the figurine retains the same facial details as in Image A.",
