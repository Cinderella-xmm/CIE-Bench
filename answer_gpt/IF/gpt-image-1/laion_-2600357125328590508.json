      "question": "Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sock is clearly constructed from LEGO-style bricks. The texture and appearance of the sock show regular, interlocking brick patterns typical of LEGO constructions. The entire surface of the sock is covered with small, rectangular blocks that fit seamlessly into one another, maintaining the sock's overall structure. This visual cue of interlocking bricks confirms that the sock is fully constructed from them.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the sock closely mimic the original patterns seen in Image A using blocky LEGO bricks. The black, gray, and white colors are arranged in a way that replicates the design, and although the texture has changed due to the use of bricks, the color scheme and design remain consistent with traditional sock patterns, showcasing the integrity of the original design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sculpture that is made of evenly layered LEGO bricks, but the surface appears relatively flat and unvarying in height from any area of the sock. Thus, there is no notable variation in brick height that would create additional depth or a three-dimensional effect across the sock's structure. This suggests that the sculpture does not incorporate the layered construction that varies by height but instead maintains a uniform surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the sock displayed in Image B, an orange block is visible, resembling a LEGO brick in texture and style. This block appears as an integral part of the LEGO construction, suggesting that the tag has been replaced with a LEGO piece of similar color and function.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The environment in Image B shows a single object — the sock sculpture — positioned on a plain white platform, within an undecorated, neutral-colored room. The absence of additional objects, textures, or contrasting colors contributes to a minimalist, gallery-like presentation, focusing attention on the sculpture itself without any visual clutter.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture exhibits a structured form with meticulously aligned rows of LEGO bricks and well-defined edges, signifying careful construction. The blocks are arranged systematically to model the textile pattern and shape of a sock, emphasizing structural precision typical of architectural detail.",
