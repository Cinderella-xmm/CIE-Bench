    "Question": "Q5: Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the scene is detailed, the surfaces of the road and cliffs don’t clearly reveal distinct micro gravel textures. The textures seem smooth and streamlined rather than granular as micro gravel would typically appear.",
    "answer": "No"
