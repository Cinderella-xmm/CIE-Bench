      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted using a subtle line-art style with visible outlines that define his form and tai chi posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is drawn in a line-art style, where the outlines clearly define his form and posture. This style typically uses thin lines to sketch the contours and details in a simplified manner. Commonly, such a design emphasizes the shape and the pose rather than intricate details. Without referring to Image A first, the visual cues in Image B indicate that this is indeed a line-art style rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rendered in soft pastel watercolor tones rather than bold or naturalistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall palette is dominated by soft pastel tones, resembling watercolor washes. These colors include light pinks for the cherry blossoms and cream-like tones for the attire and background. Pastel watercolors create a gentle, subdued effect different from bold or sharp colors. Observing Image B independently supports the conclusion that the image emphasizes soft pastel tones.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are cherry blossom patterns visibly present in the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cherry blossom patterns are evident throughout the background, representing a common serene visual element. The patterns feature clusters of blossoming flowers in soft pink colors. These visual elements reinforce the theme of tranquility and culturally significant motifs. Based solely on Image B, it’s apparent that cherry blossoms are present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a minimalistic monthly date grid present in the image, showing spaces for each day of the month?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no typical monthly date grid present; the image instead has the word 'April' placed at the bottom, signifying the month itself but not providing space or indications for individual days through a grid format. Given this information, Image B does not offer a monthly date grid.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the individual cells in the date grid reflect or mirror the balanced posture of the tai chi stance in their shape or arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not contain a monthly date grid, there are no cells to match or reflect the balanced posture of the tai chi stance. Given this lack of grid presence, observation reveals there is no relation in shape or arrangement to the posture within the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys a Zen-like atmosphere through its elements: the minimalistic approach, the soft pastel colors akin to traditional Zen art aesthetics, and a well-balanced design. By focusing on simplicity and using gentle tones, the image successfully achieves a calm and harmonious ambiance reflecting Zen principles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both Image A and Image B, the elderly man’s stance remains consistent, with one leg raised and his hands in a meditative gesture. Despite the stylistic change in Image B, the fundamental posture of the man practicing tai chi is unchanged from the original Image A.",
