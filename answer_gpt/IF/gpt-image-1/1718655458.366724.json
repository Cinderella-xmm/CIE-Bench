      "question": "Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the visual features show LEGO bricks that have marbled patterns similar to those seen in Image A, which has spheres and cubes with marbling. The LEGO bricks have adopted this marbled aesthetic, indicating a complete transformation from spheres and cubes to brick shapes while retaining the patterns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows LEGO bricks with a marble-like pattern; these bricks appear to have a matte finish as there are no visible reflective highlights commonly seen on glossy surfaces. This conclusion is drawn from observing the diffuse light distribution and lack of shiny spots.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the LEGO bricks are neatly arranged on wooden shelves in rows and columns, indicating a structured and orderly pattern. This organization contrasts the scattered arrangement of objects in Image A, representing an intentional presentation style on the shelves.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

This shift to a simpler style highlights the bricks and shelves, reinforcing a minimalist design approach in Image B.",
