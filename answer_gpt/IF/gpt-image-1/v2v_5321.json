      "question": "Does the image exhibit a hand-sculpted claymation style with visible textures and a three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character and the background appear to be modeled in a claymation style, typically characterized by a handmade, textured look and a three-dimensional form. The clothing details, hair, and accessory items all appear to have a sculpted quality with visible marks that suggest hand-sculpting. The entire scene appears to have a tactile, crafted appearance that is distinct from traditional photography.",

      "question": "Are the stripes on the character's costume clearly defined and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the characterâ€™s costume are distinctly visible. They have a bold presence synonymous with the exaggerated style often seen in claymation, where features are accentuated for dramatic effect. The texture of the clay also lends a unique depth and definition to the stripes, contributing to their pronounced and emphasized appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character's beret clearly visible and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beret in Image B is clearly visible, appearing as a distinct sculpted feature atop the character's head. In claymation, such features are often accentuated both in shape and texture, which is evident here. The beret's design is marked by rounded edges and a sculpted finish that aligns well with the claymation aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background maintain the European rooftop setting, with architectural details adapted to the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the European rooftop setting from Image A, maintaining the general compositional layout but transforming it into a claymation style. This style involves simplified shapes and muted colors typical of clay models, while still recognizable as European architecture. The texture and forms are indicative of sculpted elements, which is consistent with claymation techniques.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire image, including the character and the background, consistently rendered in the hand-sculpted claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the character and the background display a cohesive hand-sculpted appearance associated with claymation. The texture, color choices, and simplified geometric forms are consistent throughout the entirety of the image, suggesting a uniform application of claymation techniques both on the figure and the architectural setting.",
