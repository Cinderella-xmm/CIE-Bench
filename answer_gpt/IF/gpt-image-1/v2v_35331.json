      "question": "Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the dog has been merged with the shape of the banana, creating a new surreal form where they appear to be one entity. The image gives the impression of a creature that has the body of a banana with the legs of a Chihuahua, excluding the blurred face portion, which supports the notion of them being part of a single entity.",

      "question": "Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows an unnatural blend of a banana and dog body, which does not exist in reality and is clearly a result of manipulation. Given the visual cues and knowledge of real-world objects, it is evident that this form does not occur in nature, highlighting the obvious signs of editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, apart from the blurred face, the transition between the banana and the dog's legs is executed meticulously, allowing the edited form to look cohesive in those areas. The alteration does not have any harsh or jagged edges where the two forms meet, making the transition appear smooth.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image demonstrates a blended form with the banana being the primary body and the dog's legs attached to it. Considering the scale of the dog's legs and ears in relation to the large banana body, the proportions are inconsistent and unrealistic within the context of a naturally occurring form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows on the blended form in Image B correspond well with the lighting conditions evident in Image A, disregarding the face area. Both the banana and dog's components have lighting which matches the grassy environment, suggesting careful attention was paid to maintain the same lighting conditions during editing.",
