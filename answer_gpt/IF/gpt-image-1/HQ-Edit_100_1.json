      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear wooden frame around the scene, resembling a shadow box frame. This frame is visually apparent and distinct, enclosing the entire depicted scene. The shadow box design typically involves a frame that creates depth by recessing the contents, which matches the presentation here. This conclusion is based on the visual cue of the wooden edges surrounding the entire image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the tree been scaled down in size and rendered with enhanced 3D surface texture (e.g., visible bark details, depth, shading)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a tree that appears smaller compared to Image A, fitting within the confines of the shadow box. The tree in Image B lacks detailed bark textures and doesn't exhibit the same level of depth and shading as a realistic 3D object. Instead, it appears more two-dimensional and more akin to a painted or crafted style, without the intricate rendering found in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers (e.g., pink, yellow, blue, red) beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B features various patches of flowers in shades like pink, yellow, blue, and red beneath the tree. These flowers are distinctly visible and distributed across the grassy area. The visual cues of different colored flowers are easily identified based on the composition and flower shapes, which align with typical representations of multiple flower types.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background consist of multiple layered painted surfaces that create a sense of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B does not show multiple layered painted surfaces; instead, it appears as a single painted layer with clouds and sky, providing a flat depiction. Unlike an image with layered surfaces where shadows, overlapping edges, and clear separations between layers would create depth perception, Image B maintains a simple 2D painted look. This is based on the analysis of visual cues, such as uniform color and flat presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires above or within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the clouds are depicted as being suspended by thin wires, which are visible. This gives the impression of miniature cloud models hanging within a diorama, consistent with the idea of clouds being physically positioned within the shadow box frame rather than simply painted on. The wires and cloud shapes are distinct features contributing to the effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image include surreal or stylized elements (e.g., floating clouds, soft glow, pastel hues) that contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates several surreal and stylized elements, such as the floating clouds suspended by wires and the overall pastel color scheme. These features evoke a whimsical, dreamlike atmosphere, distinguishable from more realistic imagery. The presence of elements curated for visual charm, like the deliberate softness and playful presentation, reinforces this interpretation.",
