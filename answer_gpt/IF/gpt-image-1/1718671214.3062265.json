        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono is depicted with bold outlines and vibrant colors, typical of anime-style artwork.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches of the cherry blossoms are drawn with strong, high-contrast lines that give them an ink-like quality. This approach lacks the soft gradients or textures that would make them appear natural, instead opting for a more graphic style typical of certain types of illustration, particularly in anime and manga.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
