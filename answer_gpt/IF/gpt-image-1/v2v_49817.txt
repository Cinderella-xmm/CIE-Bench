    "Question": "Q2: Is the hatted woman portrayed as a revered scribe meticulously preparing a stylus with a device similar to the sharpener?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman with the hat is depicted with minimal details, and the object resembles a pencil sharpener in form but is stylized, giving it a more historical feel. While the depiction suggests a figure engaged in a traditional task, the ancient-style carving does not explicitly convey her as a revered scribe. The role is implied more by the context of handling a tool, but it lacks direct symbolic elements typically associated with scribes, such as hieroglyphic writing tools.",
