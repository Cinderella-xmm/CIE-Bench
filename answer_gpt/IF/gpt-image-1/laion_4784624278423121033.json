      "question": "Has the circular dough been replaced with a realistic atom illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, a drawing of an atom is placed where the circular dough with a pressed atom design was in Image A. The realistic depiction includes labeled electrons, protons, and neutrons alongside the atom diagram, which was not present on Image A's dough. This indicates a shift from a physical dough to an illustrated representation that looks like an atom.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple atom-shaped cookie designs centered in the image, each in a different color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only one atom-shaped cookie cutter is depicted alongside a colorful atom illustration. The illustration part includes multiple orbital paths in different colors, enhancing its visual appeal. However, there are no multiple cookie designs, just one cutter and one illustrated atom.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there arrows pointing to and labeling electrons, protons, and neutrons on the atom illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an atom illustration with text labels that show 'electron', 'proton', and 'neutron', each accompanied by an arrow pointing to the respective parts of the atom. This additional information embellishes the atom depiction with educational elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry' is styled in a straightforward, clean font rather than a whimsical or playful one. The font choice is more traditional and formal, fitting the scientific theme rather than a playful motif.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, you can see a dotted line positioned horizontally between the atom-shaped cookie cutter and the illustrated atom. This line acts as a visual separator between the physical object and the illustration.",
