      "question": "Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango displays significant pixelation, with individual square-like pixels visible. This pixelation is characteristic of 8-bit graphics, which are known for their limited resolution and distinct pixel-based appearance. The visual cues of clearly delineated pixels confirm this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the table and the napkin are depicted using blocky pixel shapes and lack intricate details seen in higher resolution images. This simplification and low resolution are consistent with 8-bit graphics, which typically favor simple forms over fine detailing due to their inherent limitations in resolution.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly utilizes a restricted color palette, featuring only a few distinct and flat colors. This limited palette, with its focus on basic tones rather than gradients or multiple shades, is typical of 8-bit graphics, which often had a restricted number of colors due to hardware limitations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and highlights are simplified into flat areas of color contrasting against the main surfaces. Rather than gradual transitions or subtle gradients, the shading in 8-bit graphics often employs blocky sections of different tones to convey light and shadow, consistent with what is observed in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a composition where objects like the mango, table, and napkin are depicted through basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures. This simplification is typical for 8-bit graphics, which aimed to succinctly represent objects without intricate detailing due to technical constraints.",
