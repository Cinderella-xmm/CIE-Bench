      "question": "Is the animal composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles arranged to form its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal is depicted with a surface that consists of small, distinct squares arranged in a grid-like pattern. Each square is consistent in size and appears to be a standalone piece, resembling ceramic tiles that are typically used in mosaic art. The visual texture and appearance of the surface support the conclusion that these are ceramic tiles forming the body of the animal.",

      "question": "Are the stripes made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stripes on the animal in Image B are composed of small square tiles that exhibit a glossy finish, which is evident from the way light reflects off them. The colors of these tiles are a vivid orange and a deep black, which create a visually striking contrast typical of ceramic mosaics. Therefore, the stripes are indeed made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black.",

      "question": "Are the eyes and snout formed from precisely cut ceramic tiles that maintain their expressive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and snout of the animal are depicted using tiles arranged to create clear and expressive features. The tiles are carefully placed to capture the roundness of the eyes and the shape of the snout, maintaining a recognizable and expressive appearance typical of mosaic art, where precision in tile placement contributes to the overall expression of features.",

      "question": "Is the mosaic animal positioned on a surface with a visible sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows the animal placed on what appears to be sand, characterized by a consistent grainy texture that is typical of sandy surfaces by the sea. The colors and texture along with the blurred background reinforce the perception of a beach setting, indicating that the mosaic animal is indeed on a surface with a visible sandy texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the smooth, glossy surface of the tiles and the rough, granular texture of the platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) showcases a distinct contrast between the smooth and glossy surface of the ceramic tiles making up the animal and the rough, granular texture of the sandy beach surface it stands on. This visual contrast is noticeable due to the reflective quality of the glossy tiles compared to the matte, granular appearance of sand, a typical contrast found in mosaic displays where glossy tiles are positioned against more natural textures.",
