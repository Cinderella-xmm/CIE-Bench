      "question": "Are all makeup brushes replaced with sculpted crystal wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe sculpted crystal wands with distinct shapes, cylindrical bodies, and different colored tips, indicating they are not makeup brushes but designed objects meant to resemble wands. Image A depicts makeup brushes with soft bristles in various shapes and sizes. The absence of the previous brush texture and presence of crystal material confirms the change.",

      "question": "Does each crystal wand have a unique gemstone at its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, it's evident that each wand has a distinctively colored tip that appears to be shaped like a gemstone. This variety of colors and crystal-like appearance suggests uniqueness in gemstone type and color. Image A only contains uniform makeup brush tips without any gemstones.",

      "question": "Is the container a transparent crystal vase with visible etched floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a container that has the qualities of a transparent crystal vase with visible etched floral designs on its surface. These floral patterns are clear and not present in Image A, which is a plain glass jar filled with pearls.",

      "question": "Has the lace band been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a ribbon-like design carved directly into the surface of the crystal vase, resembling a bow with detailed etching resembling lace in texture. Image A previously had a lace band wrapped around the glass jar. This visual transformation from fabric lace to etched crystal ribbon indicates a replacement has occurred.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire arrangement placed on a mirrored surface that reflects the crystal vase and wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B reveals the arrangement is on a surface that reflects the bottom part of the crystal vase, suggesting it is mirrored. The mirrored reflection is coherent with the lighting and angles presented in the image, while Image A shows a different table surface without such reflective qualities.",
