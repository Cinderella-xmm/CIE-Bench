      "question": "Is the ornate book now represented as a collection of interlocking wooden puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is depicted as a collection of interlocking wooden puzzle pieces arranged together to form a cohesive image. This contrasts with typical book imagery, which usually features bound pages and a spine. The puzzle pieces are evident due to their shape and arrangement, suggesting they can be taken apart and reassembled, a characteristic of puzzles rather than books.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, close examination reveals that the dragon patterns carved into the puzzle pieces have darker wood tones that enhance their visibility and detail. This visual distinction is typical of stained wood, where specific areas are accentuated to emphasize certain features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the compass area in contrast to the adjacent dragon pattern areas. The compass appears to have lighter wood tones compared to the darker tones of the dragon designs, which helps differentiate these two elements visually and highlights the intricacies of the compass design within the puzzle.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the puzzle pieces display distinct wood grain textures, which are typical characteristics of wooden materials. These textures add realism and detail to the pieces, enhancing the overall aesthetic and confirming their wooden composition.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are shown with smooth, well-defined edges, typical of well-crafted puzzles. Puzzle pieces require precise edges for proper fitting and interlocking, which is evident in this image as each piece has distinct and clear boundaries.",
