    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited shirt design use vibrant, saturated colors typical of pop art rather than subdued or earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are indeed vibrant and saturated, typical of pop art style. The use of bright blues, pinks, and oranges clearly communicates an energetic, vivid palette, contrasting sharply with earthy tones. This aligns with pop art's characteristic use of high-intensity color. Without referring to Image A, the conclusion is derived from recognizing the boldness and vibrancy of the colors in Image B alone, matching common expectations for pop art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are large, solid-colored sections used to define the muscular figureâ€™s anatomy, such as chest, arms, and legs, replacing fine shading or gradient effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs large, solid color blocks to articulate the figure's anatomy, producing a clear and striking contrast that emphasizes the muscular form without relying on shading or gradients. This creates a bold and simplified look typical of pop art. The visual contrast helps to identify these sections quickly and effectively.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the edges of the figure and surrounding elements consist of crisp, angular, or straight lines rather than flowing or organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines defining the figure and surrounding elements are mostly crisp and angular, lending a modern, geometric aesthetic typical of pop art. This style contrasts with potentially more fluid or organic lines seen in different artistic genres.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the previously subtle or gold-toned patterns now rendered in bright, glowing neon colors such as electric blue, hot pink, or lime green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, patterns are reimagined using bright, neon colors like electric blue and hot pink, transforming them from potentially subtle or gold tones to a striking and energetic effect. This matches the aesthetic of vibrant pop art and contrasts heavily against Image A's subtler gold-toned patterns.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features recurring stylized patterns like waves and stars scattered across the design, reinforcing an energetic and dynamic composition typical of pop art. These decorations contribute to a vibrant and lively overall effect, creating consistency across the piece.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the transformation into pop art style, the central figure in Image B remains identifiable as a muscular male in a dynamic pose with raised arms, preserving the core composition of the original design seen in Image A. The solid colors and bold outlines continue to depict the character distinctly.",
