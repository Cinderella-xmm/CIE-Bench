      "question": "Have the heads of the three individuals been made slightly bigger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heads of the individuals exhibit a stylistic choice typical in cartoon illustrations, where heads are enlarged compared to body size to emphasize features, even though exact details of the face are not discernible. This is a common characteristic in cartoon depictions and suggests that the heads have been deliberately made bigger for an exaggerated effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features and accessories of the three individuals precisely detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no detailed facial features or accessories visible; instead, the image uses simplistic forms and shapes indicative of a cartoon style. This is typical in cartoons where less emphasis is placed on detailed realism and more on broad characteristics.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bodies of the three individuals have a cartoonish appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bodies of the individuals are rendered with simplified lines and shapes, lacking detailed texture and proportions found in realistic depictions, which is indicative of a cartoonish style. The proportions are more exaggerated and stylized compared to realistic forms.",

      "question": "Is the log cabin in the background smaller in scale compared to the individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the log cabin appears smaller than it realistically should be compared to the human figures, exaggerating the size of the individuals relative to the structure. This choice often aligns with the style of cartoons where scale may be altered for effect or simplicity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three individuals positioned in front of the small-scale log cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals are visually positioned in front of the log cabin. This is inferred due to their overlapping placement over parts of the cabin, common in images to create the perception of spatial arrangement.",
