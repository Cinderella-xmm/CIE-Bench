      "question": "Does the male character's tee have a plush 3D appearance with a bold geometric pattern and an enlarged collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character's tee is designed with a plush, three-dimensional appearance, typical of chibi-style figures. The pattern is bold and geometric, and there is an enlarged collar which is not present in Image A's flatter design. The 3D model exaggerates certain features to create a playful, cartoonish look, which is a common characteristic in chibi art.",

      "question": "Are the male character's pants rendered in a plush 3D style with a bold geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character's pants have a plush, 3D texture and include a bold geometric pattern around the band and cuffs. This differs from Image A, where the pants are simply plain grey with no such pattern. The switch to a bold pattern and a more pronounced 3D texture supports the chibi style's intent to enhance whimsy.",

      "question": "Do the female character's high-waisted pants feature exaggerated, prominent pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female character's high-waisted pants are rendered in a plush, 3D style but there is no pronounced pleating. The pants are smooth and round, lacking the distinct pleats seen in Image A. This simplification suits the chibi style, which often omits fine details for a more rounded and simplified appearance.",

      "question": "Is the sleeve of the female character's top visibly enlarged compared to normal proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female character's top features sleeves that are more rounded and pronounced relative to normal proportions, emphasizing the plush, toy-like appearance of the clothing. This is a departure from Image A's more subdued sleeve size and is typical for chibi figurines where proportions are exaggerated for a playful effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both characters rendered as chibi-style figurines with large heads, small bodies, and cartoonish proportions, dancing on a pastel-colored stage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are depicted as chibi-style figurines. They have exaggerated head sizes, smaller bodies, and overall cartoonish proportions. They appear to be dancing and are positioned on a stage with a pastel color palette, enhancing the whimsical and playful aesthetic typical of chibi artwork. Comparing to Image A, both the setting and proportions conform to the classic chibi style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the characters exhibit graceful dance poses, joyful expressions, and are placed on a pastel-colored stage, conveying playful elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows characters on a pastel-colored stage, their poses align with typical chibi aesthetic rather than graceful dance moves. Their expressions, though blurred, are suggested to be joyful due to the whimsical nature of chibi figures. However, the emphasis on cartoonish, rather than elegant, may not fully capture 'playful elegance' as described. Instead, it portrays a more straightforward playful tone.",
