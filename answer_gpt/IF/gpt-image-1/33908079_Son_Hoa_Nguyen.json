      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoonized Image B, the worker's hands are noticeably larger compared to the rest of the body. This is a common technique in cartooning to emphasize certain actions, such as picking tea leaves, whereas in Image A, the proportions are more realistic and natural.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fields are depicted with vibrant greens and earthy tones.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
