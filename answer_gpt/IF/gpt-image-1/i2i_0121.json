      "question": "Does the character display exaggerated chibi proportions with a larger head and smaller body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a depiction of the character with a significantly larger head compared to the body and limb sizes, which is a defining trait of the chibi art style. This style is characterized by cute, exaggerated proportions to emphasize childish or adorable aspects. The visual cues in Image B affirm that the character possesses such proportions, indicative of chibi designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character standing on a shell-shaped base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted on a circular base that visually resembles a wooden platform or a cut-out circle rather than a shell-like shape. The base does not have the scalloped or curved edges that would typically suggest it's shaped like a shell. Thus, world knowledge about shell shapes does not align with the visuals of the base in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the chibi version retain the character's straw hat, red jacket, and cheerful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the character with a distinctive straw hat, a red jacket, and a cheerful expression—which are hallmark features from the original design in the source material. These elements are maintained in the chibi version to ensure the character remains recognizably the same despite the chibi transformation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the character’s features (like buttons on the jacket and belt) simplified but still recognizable in the chibi design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character maintains simplified representations of features such as the red jacket with buttons and a yellow belt. These features are less detailed than what would be seen in a non-chibi depiction, yet they have been simplified in a way that preserves their recognizability. This is typical in chibi art, where the focus is on retaining identifiable characteristics while simplifying details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base clearly visible under the character's feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the character atop a circular base that resembles more of a flat disc or platform, not a shell shape. The outline and form of this base do not show any features characteristic of shell shapes, such as scalloped or ridged edges. Thus, there is no indication of a shell shape clearly visible under the character's feet.",
