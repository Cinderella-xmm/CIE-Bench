    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain three separate frames capturing the skater's motion?",
    "explanation": "By analyzing the edited image, one can clearly see three distinct positions of the skater, which suggests a sequence capturing the motion of the skater over time. Each frame shows a different phase of the motion, showcasing the movement step-by-step. This setup is often used to depict motion dynamics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the three frames clearly showing the push-off, ground contact, and forward lean of the skater?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the three frames display distinct phases of skateboarding: the initial push-off where the skater bends their body, the ground contact point indicating tension in the legs, and finally, the forward lean demonstrating momentum transfer. These phases form a logical sequence of the skateboarding action.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image retain the real image style without any significant stylistic distortions?",
    "explanation": "The edited image maintains a realistic photographic style with natural colors and lighting typical of candid shots. There are no noticeable artificial alterations or stylistic enhancements affecting the overall realism of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are motion trajectory lines present in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image contains a red curved line that visually represents the trajectory of the skater's motion. This line helps illustrate the path of movement across the frames, highlighting the transition from one phase to the next.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the three frames combined in a cohesive manner within the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a fluid integration of the three frames, ensuring each position is contextually and spatially linked. The visual continuity is maintained, allowing the viewer to interpret the skater's motion smoothly and cohesively without disruption.",
    "answer": "Yes"
