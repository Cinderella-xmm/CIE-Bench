    "Question": "Q1: Is the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title present at the top reads 'SPACE STATION DYNAMICS', indicating the main subject of the infographic. The title does not include the word 'Astronaut'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?",
    "explanation": "Image B features elements like the astronaut, Moon, and ISS rendered in a flat, vector style rather than using photorealistic details, characterized by simple lines and shapes that are common in illustrations or infographics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the spacesuit include visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spacesuit is depicted using a vector-style illustration, which typically lacks detailed textures such as stitching or fabric patterns and instead uses broad fills and outlines.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are gold accents used in the image to emphasize certain elements such as labels, borders, or arrows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, gold accents are visible in the arrows indicating movement and possibly other elements like borders, which is a stylistic choice to highlight or differentiate parts of an illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there three sequential stages illustrated with arrows showing the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station?",
    "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, there are arrows illustrating movement or interaction with the space station, but not specifically three stages labeled as such. The arrows imply movement but do not delineate distinct stages.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the labels “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, and “Step 3: Operate” displayed in sequence along the bottom of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show any labels such as 'Step 1: Prepare', 'Step 2: Navigate', and 'Step 3: Operate'. The image is focused on illustrating with vector graphics and does not include these textual labels.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the entire infographic arranged in a vertical format with elements stacked from top to bottom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of elements appears more horizontal to include space for the space station on the right side and the title at the top. The main items like the astronaut and arrows are spread out in a balanced layout rather than a purely vertical format.",
    "answer": "No"
