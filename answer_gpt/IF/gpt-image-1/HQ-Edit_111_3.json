        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes structured elements such as labels for different parts of the butterfly and text boxes that explain the butterfly's feeding habits and role in pollination. This organization and inclusion of informative text are typical features of an educational infographic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is thoroughly examined but does not present any textual elements serving as a title, including 'Butterfly Biology Basics,' prominently at the top or center. Instead, it focuses on annotations and text boxes providing information about the butterfly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax) labeled with monochrome line-drawing overlays on the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the anatomical components such as the antennae and wings are marked with labels and lines pointing to these parts. However, the thorax is not explicitly labeled, which suggests the anatomical labeling does not fully cover all specified parts.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, pink flowers are present underneath the butterfly, suggesting a feeding preference as indicated by the text box. The flowers’ presence visually aligns with the text mention of nectar feeding.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a text box that explicitly discusses how butterflies contribute to pollination, meeting the criteria for including explanatory text on this ecological role.",
