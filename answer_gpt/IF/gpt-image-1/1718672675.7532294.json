      "question": "Is the cliffside visibly shaped like a mythical titan creature with distinct anatomical features such as a head, body, or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cliffside is artistically transformed to resemble a gigantic mythical titan. The visual cues show an anthropomorphic form with a clearly defined head, body, and a limb with a hand resting on the cliff, which is distinct from the natural cliffside in Image A. The combination of natural cliff features with the humanoid shape is characteristic of mythical creatures depicted as part of the landscape.",

      "question": "Do the jagged rock formations now resemble segmented armor plating, with moss growing along their edges or crevices as decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock formations are artistically depicted to resemble segmented armor plating, often found in various fictional or mythical representations of armored creatures or beings. This visual transformation involves a textured appearance that imitates armor. Moss is illustrated as growing in the crevices of the armor-like segments, adding a decorative and natural element to the titan's appearance that was not present in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the water below the cliff appear as translucent, flowing spectral limbs connected to the titan’s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water below the cliff is visually transformed to resemble flowing spectral limbs that seem to connect to and emerge from the titan's body. This artistic choice creates an impression of the titan being intertwined with its environment, blurring the line between the physical and the mystical, which is distinct from the natural depiction of water in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the small trees arranged in a dense, flowing pattern along the upper part of the titan’s head or neck, resembling a textured mane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of vegetation on the titan’s upper part, possibly its head or neck, is dense and creates a flowing natural pattern. This arrangement resembles a mane or decorative crown typically associated with divine or mythical entities, adding a layer of organic detail to the titan's portrayal, which contrasts with the irregular distribution of vegetation in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there visible carved runes or symbolic markings on the surface of the rock formations forming the titan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock surfaces forming the titan's body are embellished with carved runes or symbolic markings. These markings suggest ancient or mystical significance, adding a layer of storytelling or mythological context to the titan's image. Such elements are absent in Image A, where the rocks have a natural appearance without any human-made inscriptions.",

      "question": "Are the clouds replaced by glowing, twisting spirit-like forms spiraling around the titan’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of natural clouds, there are illustrations of glowing, wispy forms that appear to twist and spiral around the titan's body. These forms are created to resemble spirits or mystical energies, complementing the overall mythical theme of the image. In contrast, Image A depicts ordinary clouds without such fantastical elements.",
