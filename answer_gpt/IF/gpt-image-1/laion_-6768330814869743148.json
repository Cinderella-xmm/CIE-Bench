      "question": "Are the pastries depicted with exaggerated, bright colors and bold outlines characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries are illustrated using exaggerated colors and bold outlines, which are characteristic elements of pop art. This art style often employs vibrant colors and defined shapes to create striking visuals that stand out. Recognizing these features allows us to conclude that the style used in Image B is indeed pop art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the bread slices feature bold outlines and vivid, non-naturalistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bread slices outlined in thick lines and filled with vibrant colors that deviate from naturalistic tones, such as bright oranges and reds which are not typical for bread. This indicates a stylized representation rather than a realistic depiction, aligning with pop art conventions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the muffin liners replaced with distinct geometric patterns such as triangles, squares, or other regular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muffin liners are visibly altered to include geometric patterns like grid lines, which consist of regular shapes rather than the simple muffin liner design seen in Image A. This abstraction is a common motif in pop art, emphasizing geometry and patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wooden trays replaced with a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly shows the tray surfaces as covered with alternating colors in a checkerboard pattern, moving away from the wooden texture seen in Image A. Such patterns are a staple of pop art, creating an eye-catching and visually dynamic surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cups from Image A have been substituted with abstract shapes that are colorful and non-representational. These shapes are stylized and do not attempt to accurately depict real objects, which fits within the realm of pop art's emphasis on abstraction and color.",
