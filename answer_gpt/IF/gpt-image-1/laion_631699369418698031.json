    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the totem pole now presented as a miniature scene within a confined space, suggesting a scaled-down 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the totem pole is placed inside a glass dome, which suggests a contained environment. This setup, along with the presence of miniature ferns, conveys the impression of a scaled-down 3D scene. The dome encapsulates the totem pole, implying a miniaturized version of the outdoors.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the totem pole in Image B is surrounded by green plants that appear to be tiny ferns and moss, which are consistent with typical miniature plant life used in small-scale displays.",
