      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a serpent-shaped creature that is formed by the arrangement of beads along its body. The beads are interconnected, giving the appearance of a continuous form rather than being loose or clustered. This conclusion is drawn from the clear depiction of the serpent shape and the seamless transition of beads along its form, which suggests continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body features red and yellow patterns that are applied in a manner suggestive of scales. This is observed in the repetitive nature of the patterns along the surface, which mimic the appearance of scales commonly found on snake skin. The visual arrangement and color contrast reinforce a textured effect typical of reptiles.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the serpent have two blue circular features positioned as eyes at its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B has two prominent blue circular features located at the head. These features are positioned similarly to eyes, where such circular elements typically suggest eye-like characteristics, especially when placed on the head of a creature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays black motifs that appear intricately designed and arranged along the serpent's body. These motifs are reminiscent of tribal-style patterns due to their detailed and geometric characteristics, which are consistent with traditional tribal artwork techniques.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the end of the serpent in Image B, the tail is depicted as elongating into a thin, wispy extension, culminating in small, bead-like formations at the tips. This presentation is visible in the detailed illustration where tail tips mimic bead shapes, suggesting flow and motion.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
