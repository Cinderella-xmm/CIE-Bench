      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is confined within a dome-like transparent enclosure, which appears to be made of glass. Such structures are often used to enclose miniature models or displays for protection and presentation purposes. The presence of this dome suggests that the scene is designed to be self-contained, which aligns with the concept of a terrarium.",

      "question": "Are the snow-capped peaks made of visibly textured and glittering materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peak is covered with what looks to be a textured white material that mimics snow. Its surface appears to catch and reflect light in a way that suggests a glittering effect. This visual detail conveys an artificial and decorative approach to representing snow.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the landscape feature intricately detailed, fine-brushed foliage instead of natural-looking vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vegetation in Image B resembles finely detailed and carefully crafted textures, akin to the miniature scenes where realism is achieved through meticulous craftsmanship. This differs from the natural randomness found in wild vegetation, indicating a more designed and controlled representation.",

      "question": "Is the lake represented by a reflective, translucent resin-like surface with a synthetic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface appears to have a glossy and smooth finish, characteristic of materials like resin used in miniature displays. The reflective quality of the surface, resembling a polished effect, further supports this synthetic representation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Along the shoreline in Image B, there are small structures that are clearly designed and detailed, resembling chalet-style buildings. These structures are typical of miniature collections and are not naturally part of typical landscape photography.",
