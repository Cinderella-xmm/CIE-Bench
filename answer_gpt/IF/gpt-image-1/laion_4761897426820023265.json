      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Great Wall and surrounding mountains rendered as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presentation suggests a miniature 3D model, likely because the details and proportions of the objects, including the Great Wall and mountains, are small and exceptionally detailed. This is indicative of an artistic representation rather than an actual photograph, where the scale would be much larger. Additionally, a snow globe setting often includes decorative miniature scenes.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the miniature model is encapsulated within a clear, spherical structure, which is characteristic of a snow globe. This conclusion is supported by the presence of other typical snow globe features, such as the artistic scenery and enclosed environment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
