      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the buildings in the skyline rendered with pixel-patterned or grid-like luminous facades resembling a digital display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings have facades that appear to be made up of a series of tiny, luminescent squares or grids, which is characteristic of pixelated digital displays. This visual aspect gives them a high-tech, futuristic appearance, similar to a city's skyline in a digital or cyberpunk theme.",

      "question": "Do the buildings exhibit a glowing or luminescent effect, such as bright edges, internal illumination, or radiant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings in Image B are depicted with bright, glowing edges and internal lighting effects. The vivid colors add to the luminescent effect, creating a vibrant, futuristic look. This is a common style used to convey a futuristic or cyber-enhanced urban environment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the trees been replaced with glowing, angular, circuit-like structures composed of lines and nodes resembling digital pathways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the natural appearance of the trees has been replaced with angular, glowing structures that resemble circuit boards or digital pathways. These structures have lines and nodes indicative of electronic circuits, aligning with a digital or cybernetic theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridge in Image B is enhanced with brightly colored neon lines that outline its structure, effectively turning it into a glowing pathway. This effect enhances the futuristic aesthetic of the scene, consistent with a neon-lit digital landscape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirety of Image B displays a consistent theme of futuristic technology. From the buildings with pixel-like facades and a glowing appearance to the circuit-like trees and the neon-lit bridge, every element is rendered to evoke a sense of a technologically advanced, cyberpunk-style cityscape.",
