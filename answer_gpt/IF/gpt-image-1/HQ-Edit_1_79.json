      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image composed of three distinct panels arranged side by side or in a triptych layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows a layout that is divided into three distinct vertical sections or panels. Each panel contains separate, themed illustrations which is characteristic of a triptych layout. This is evident from the equal division of the image and the thematic continuity across the panels, with different elements present in each section.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the central panel show a cartoon-style depiction of the womanâ€™s hands turning the pages of the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the central panel, there is a cartoon-style illustration where a woman is depicted holding a book and turning its pages. The style is simplified and outlined, matching characteristics of cartoon artwork. The focus on the book and the position of the hands suggest the action of turning pages.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the left panel display a morphed version of her hand that transitions into a tree branch structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left panel contains an illustration of a tree, but it does not morph from the woman's hand; rather, it is just a tree with leaves. The visual elements do not suggest a transformation from hand to tree branch, but rather a depiction of a tree naturally.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the right panel show floral elements such as flowers or vines decorating or brightening the bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right panel includes floral elements such as flowers and vines which are decorating and brightening the scene. These elements are drawn alongside what appears to be a bench, highlighting it with colorful floral depictions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the panels rendered on soft pastel-colored paper with visible leaf-patterned textures along their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire edited image, including all three panels, appears to be rendered with a soft color palette typical of pastels. There are visible patterns resembling leaves within the background of each panel, creating a textured effect along the edges, enhancing the thematic pastel appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the elderly woman still recognizable in at least the central panel, with her facial features, glasses, and book clearly present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central panel depicts a stylized version of the woman, with distinctive features like her hands, hair, and clothing style similar to the original image. However, due to the cartoon style and facial blurring, specific facial features and glasses are not definitively clear, especially with the absence of detailed facial features in the style used.",
