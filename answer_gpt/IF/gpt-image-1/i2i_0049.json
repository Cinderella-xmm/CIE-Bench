        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is a clear, distinct representation of a single zebra with black and white stripes, standing on a brownish ground.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual description of Image B shows a transition from an area potentially covered with grass or natural scenery to a simplistic green gradient background, creating a flat plane effect directly behind the zebra, demonstrating that the grass area has indeed been replaced.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a singular zebra on a barren ground with a gradient background, absent of any additional elements or distractions such as other animals, objects, or complex textures. This presentation maintains a calm and solitary atmosphere due to its minimalist composition, focusing solely on the zebra.",
