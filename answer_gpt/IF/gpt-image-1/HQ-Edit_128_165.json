      "question": "Has the ornate lantern been fully transformed into a jellyfish shape, with a bell-shaped body and flowing appendages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a jellyfish with a distinct bell-shaped body and numerous flowing appendages characteristic of jellyfish. The ornate lantern's transformation is complete as it wholly embodies the jellyfish form, with its fluid body and trailing tendrils replacing the rigid structure of the lantern. Thus, the ornate lantern has indeed been transformed into a jellyfish shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the metal framing elements been replaced with iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils extending from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rigid metal framing elements of the lantern are no longer present. Instead, there's the presence of flowing, ribbon-like appendages extending from the jellyfish body. These tendrils demonstrate an iridescent quality, conforming to the characteristics found in jellyfish rather than the metal framework of a lantern.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the glass panels been transformed into a translucent, bell-shaped body that appears soft and fluid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass panels of the lantern now have a soft and fluid appearance in Image B, conforming to the jellyfish's bell-shaped body. This transforms the rigid and defined glass panels of a lantern into something that appears to be translucent and soft, typical of marine jellyfish. The edited version embodies these characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original patterns replaced with glowing, swirling, organic bioluminescent designs within the jellyfish's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows intricate, glowing designs within the jellyfish's body that mimic bioluminescence. These swirling patterns are organic and visually distinct, differing from the lantern's original ornate designs. The transformation involves replacing traditional patterns with those akin to natural bioluminescent light displays found in certain marine life.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing, star-like nodules visible along the length of the iridescent tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jellyfish depicted in Image B features tendrils with glowing, star-like nodules distributed along their lengths. This detail adds to the bioluminescent effect, mimicking the luminescent features sometimes found on jellyfish, enhancing the underwater aesthetic and the feeling of organic light sources.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the jellyfish depicted floating in an underwater environment with ambient lighting, soft diffusion, and visual elements suggesting water (e.g., particles, light rays, depth)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by an underwater ambiance, demonstrated by the soft diffusion of light, ambient lighting, and the presence of visual elements such as small particles and light rays. These cues are consistent with how a jellyfish would appear in a natural aquatic setting, implying immersion in water and complementing the jellyfish transformation.",
