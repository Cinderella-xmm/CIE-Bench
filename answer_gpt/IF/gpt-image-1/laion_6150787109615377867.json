      "question": "Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop is distinctly gear-shaped, showcasing visible teeth around its perimeter and intricate engravings on its surface. This analysis is based on the visible details such as the round, cog-like shape and ornamental design, which are indicative of a gear. By contrast, Image A presents a simple, round tabletop with a textured pattern but lacks any gear-like features or intricate designs. Therefore, the evidence in Image B clearly supports the observation that the tabletop has been replaced as described.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the table legs been morphed into articulated, piston-driven limbs with visible joints and brass or copper-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are replaced with articulated limbs composed of detailed mechanical structures resembling pistons and joints, which visibly highlight a steampunk aesthetic with brass or copper coloring. This is evident from the complex mechanical design and the metallic coloration typical in steampunk motifs. In comparison, Image A shows traditional table legs that are plain and metallic without any articulated joints or design complexities. This contrast robustly supports the transformation described in the question.",

      "question": "Are there visible steam vents placed along the central column of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits steam emanating from particular spots within the mechanical structure, indicating the presence of steam vents. The steam visibility implies functioning vents as part of the steampunk design, suggesting a feature mimicking steam emission for effect. Contrasting this with Image A, which lacks any steam-related features, the analysis confirms the addition of steam vents in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the base feature intricate cog patterns and at least one rotating dial or gauge element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is heavily detailed with cog patterns, evident from the visible gear-like components and structured mechanical design typical of steampunk aesthetics. However, there isn't a visible rotating dial or gauge element discernible. Image A simply has a metallic base without cogs or gauges, but the query specifically includes rotating dials, which are not observed within the visual evidence of Image B, implying the question's criteria aren't completely met.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a significant transformation where the structured mechanical design resembles a creature more akin to steampunk style. The articulated limbs and gear-shaped elements emphasize an integrated mechanical system reflective of steampunk aesthetics. This creature-like appearance is a cohesive assembly of visible mechanics, steam emission, and intricate design, resonating with steampunk culture. Image A is a standard industrial table without any resemblance to such complex mechanized systems. Thus, this transformative comparison supports the description of Image B as a steampunk-style mechanized creature.",
