      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image divided into at least two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly two separate sections or panels, each containing distinct illustrations and text elements. This division is typical in comic-style images, where panels are used to separate different scenes or moments. Image B follows this convention by having two panels that appear side by side.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two men in the image transformed into cartoon-style anthropomorphic agents with visible agent-like characteristics (e.g., expressive faces, limbs, spy traits)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the characters as cartoon-style beings with elements typically associated with secret agents, such as suits and ties. Anthropomorphic elements include features like expressive posture and the indication of agent-like activities, displayed in a comic-like format.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the plaid-patterned tie have a visible watch communicator device, and is there a visual expression of urgency (such as motion lines or an alarmed facial expression)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the characters is shown looking at their wrist, which presumably has a watch communicator, suggestive of secret agent technology. Additionally, the thought bubble indicates urgency with the words 'He's late...', suggesting a time-sensitive situation, which is commonly visually expressed through such medium in comics.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a circular camera lens symbol embedded within the pattern of the tie with the emblem, and is there a visual indication of activation (e.g., glow, red dot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a depiction of a circular camera lens symbol on the tie of the figure, which is associated with secret or spy activities. The lens is highlighted by the word 'CLICK,' indicating activation or capturing an image, which serves as a visual cue synonymous with comic book motion or sound emphasis.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there thought bubbles present above or near the heads of the anthropomorphized agents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear thought bubble with the text 'He's late...' above the agent's head. This is a typical comic convention used to represent a character's internal thoughts and is present here to convey the dialogue or monologue style common in comics.",
      "weight": 1,

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the depiction of a lush green field similarly to Image A, though in a stylized cartoon format. The background has simplified color blocks and shapes indicative of comic art style, but retains the setting's visual theme from the original image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the thought bubbles of Image B uses a font style that is clean and simple. It looks like a sans-serif font, which is commonly used in comic representations for its readability and modern appearance.",
