    "Question": "Q1: Does the figurine maintain the skier's exact pose from the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's pose can be analyzed in relation to its skiing stance, arms and legs position, the angle of the skis, and the overall dynamism conveyed by the figurine. It features a skier bending slightly forward, with the poles held in a manner similar to skiing action, which resembles the skier's pose in Image A, known from skiing culture. Comparison shows Image A has a skier carving down the slope with similar arm and leg positions as the figurine shown in Image B.",
