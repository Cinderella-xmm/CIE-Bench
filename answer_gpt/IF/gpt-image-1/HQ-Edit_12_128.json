    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the clock's frame made of translucent crystal instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clock with a frame that appears to be made from a translucent or frosted material, giving the impression of crystal, rather than the wooden frame seen in Image A. This visual cue suggests a change from wood to crystal, which can be inferred from the polished and reflective appearance characteristic of crystal materials.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ornamental details and frame of the clock crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details have a sheen and translucent quality indicative of frosted crystal. This contrasts with Image A, where the details are carved from wood, presenting a solid and opaque texture. The visual difference suggests a change to crystal material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock face made of smooth, clear crystal with etched Roman numerals instead of a wooden face with painted numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B has a smooth appearance and the numerals are embedded or etched, consistent with crystal surfaces, unlike the wooden face with painted numerals seen in Image A. This gives the visual impression of a crystal face, aided by light reflection and clarity typically associated with such materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the pendulum been replaced with a faceted crystal ornament instead of a solid wooden disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pendulum in Image B is shown as a faceted, diamond-like crystal, offering a stark contrast to the wooden disc pendulum of Image A. The faceting and translucence are distinctly characteristic of crystal objects, indicating an edit to the pendulum material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a minimalist white marble wall with visible natural veining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the clock against a wall with a white, marble-like appearance emphasizing minimalism, as evidenced by subtle natural veining patterns typical of marble. This contrasts with the darker, textured wall of Image A, suggesting a change to a marble backdrop.",
