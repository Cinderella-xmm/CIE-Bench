      "question": "Does the chibi tech mascot incorporate the phone's original design elements and color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi tech mascot is designed to represent a phone, with a body resembling the original phone's casing, giving it a rose-pink color similar to the rose-pink phone on the bed in Image A. The camera and button placements are reminiscent of the actual phone design. This indicates that the chibi mascot has incorporated the phone's design elements and color scheme. In comparison, Image A confirms these design elements through the direct depiction of the phone itself.",

      "question": "Does the chibi tech mascot have elongated legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi mascot features limbs that are longer than what might be expected for a typical chibi figure, which is usually characterized by disproportionate and shorter legs relative to the body. Therefore, the legs appear elongated for this specific chibi design. Image A, showing only the phone, does not display any legs, confirming that elongated legs are not part of its original concept.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi mascot is equipped with glasses that appear sleek in style, alongside minimalist sneakers. However, the mascot is holding a small device resembling a phone, not a tablet or stylus.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mascot wearing a pin on its hoodie featuring a circular emblem that resembles a software logo, as well as a wristwatch or wearable gadget on its arm.
