    "Question": "Q1: Have the heads of the three individuals been made slightly bigger?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the heads of the individuals exhibit a stylistic choice typical in cartoon illustrations, where heads are enlarged compared to body size to emphasize features, even though exact details of the face are not discernible. This is a common characteristic in cartoon depictions and suggests that the heads have been deliberately made bigger for an exaggerated effect.",
