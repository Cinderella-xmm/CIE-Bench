        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is centered above the sink and is accompanied by a wall-mounted faucet directly underneath in a symmetrical layout, similar to Image A. Given that both images show a similar arrangement of these elements, the layout has been retained.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
