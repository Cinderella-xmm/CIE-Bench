        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image exhibits a texture that resembles the prominent, thick brushstrokes typical of post-impressionistic and expressionistic styles, such as those employed by Van Gogh. The visual cues suggest intentional, rough brushwork across the entire image, indicating a manual painting-like quality that is visible and distinct.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the contrast between light and dark areas is indeed heightened, with the bright yellows of the sky and lamp contrasting sharply against the darker blues of the landscape and couch.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is filled with swirling patterns and dynamic lines within all the elements such as the sky, clouds, and landscape.
