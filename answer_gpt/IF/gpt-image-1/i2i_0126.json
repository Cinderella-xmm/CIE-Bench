      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top two sections of the image clearly display a front view of an office environment. This is deduced from the depiction showing people sitting opposite each other with computer monitors in front. Elements like the tables, chairs, and plants are positioned to reveal how the setup would look when viewed from the front, capturing the orientation of these items towards the observer.",

      "question": "Is there a side view of the office environment present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no sections that directly represent a side view of the office environment. The image primarily includes depictions observed from the front and top. A side view would typically showcase profiles of people or objects viewed perpendicularly from the sides, which is not evident in the given image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom right section provides a top view of the office setup. This is identifiable as the image shows items such as tables, chairs, and computer screens viewed from above. The orientation and arrangement are typical of a top-down perspective, allowing us to see the spatial relationship between furnishings and individuals.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the three views (front, side, and top) depicted as distinct illustrations within one image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains distinct illustrations of the office setup from a front (top two sections) and a top view (bottom right section); however, it lacks the inclusion of a side view, which means the three views are not fully represented. Only two out of the three views are depicted, confirming they are not all present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the combined illustrations show the full office environment layout comprehensively, covering essential elements like desks, chairs, and equipment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the combinations of the front and top views encompass the essential components of the office layout, such as desks, chairs, computer monitors, and decorative plants. These elements are consistently visible across different view illustrations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the office environment's key elements.",
