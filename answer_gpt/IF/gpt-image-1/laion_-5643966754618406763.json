    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stack of tires reshaped into a creature resembling an armadillo with a segmented, armored back made from the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a robotic creature that strongly resembles an armadillo. This creature has a segmented, armored back that looks like it's made from something akin to tire treads, a quality armadillos are known for. This conclusion is drawn by recognizing the texture and pattern of the back, which matches the idea of a tire tread-based design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic joints located within the openings between the tires, suggesting mechanical articulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the creature with visible metallic components, notably joints that appear to connect different segments of its body. These joints imply mechanical articulation, as they are placed at the limb connections that would allow for movement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the central wheel hubs been replaced with glowing mechanical eyes that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature possesses a glowing component resembling an eye located at the front of its head area. This seems to replace the concept of a wheel hub with a glowing mechanical eye, indicated by the circular, light-emitting structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there antennae-like structures extending from the top of the creature, featuring electric blue accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features thin, rod-like structures extending from the creature's head, concluded to be antennae due to their position and form. These structures have accents of electric blue, visible as glowing tips, suggesting they are electric or energy-based.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature feature steampunk-style elements such as gears, rivets, or brass-colored metalwork, giving it a mechanical guardian appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a creature crafted in a steampunk-like fashion, evident from its industrial appearance with visible gears and riveted joints. However, the metalwork appears dark and not brass-colored, deviating slightly from typical steampunk aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the original tire tread patterns still visible and used as part of the creature’s armored exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible segments of the creature's armored back in Image B bear a resemblance to tire treads. This pattern is reminiscent of the textures typically seen on tire surfaces, indicating their inclusion as part of the creature’s exterior.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the creature have a posture or design indicating it is capable of movement, such as being balanced on wheels or having rolling components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's creature displays a design centered around mobility. Its structure, which includes limb articulation and a balance on mechanized feet rather than wheels, suggests potential for movement, but not explicitly through wheel-based motion.",
