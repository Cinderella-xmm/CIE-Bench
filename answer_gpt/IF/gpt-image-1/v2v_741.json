        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which appears to be a comic-style illustration, the character depicted is a cute anime-style girl with purple hair and eyes, wearing a purple and white outfit with text that reads 'XML Application Platform xfy'. The style is characteristic of kawaii and moe anime art, where objects or concepts are personified as adorable humanoid characters. Therefore, the answer is based on the depiction of the character matching these attributes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the character is shown with eyebrows slanted downwards towards the center and a slight frown, which is a typical depiction of an annoyed or pouting expression in anime-style art.

      "question": "Does Panel 1 include a text box with the message “Why won’t you connect?! I followed the documentation! (；´д｀)” written in a playful, casual handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 in Image B contains a speech bubble where the character says 'I followed the documentation! (；´д｀)'. The text is displayed in a casual, handwritten font style commonly found in manga and comic illustrations. However, the exact phrasing ‘Why won’t you connect?!’ is not present in the text box, so the answer is based on these details.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Panel 1 of Image B, the background depicts several computer screens, coffee cups on the desk, and visible wires behind the character, consistent with the description of a chaotic workspace. This setting enhances the narrative of the character's frustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the scene appears more organized as the character's expression changes to a satisfied one. The monitors in the background display what looks like lines of code, but without glowing effects; however, the improvement in the workspace and the character’s reaction suggest a transformation in functionality, even if the desk is not notably cleaner in visual content.",
