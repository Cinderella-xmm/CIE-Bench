      "question": "Is the leaf enclosed within a transparent spherical container resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a leaf situated inside a clear, round container. This container has characteristics similar to a traditional snow globe, such as being spherical, transparent, and containing decorative elements like floating objects resembling snowflakes. Based on these observations, combined with common knowledge of snow globes, it is reasonable to conclude that the leaf is within a container resembling a snow globe.",

      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a surface resembling a tabletop near a window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the snow globe resting on a wooden stand that appears to be part of a larger flat surface, suggesting a tabletop. In the background, there is a structure with straight lines and a gradient light, indicative of a window with sunlight streaming through. Combining these observations with common setting arrangements, the snow globe appears to be placed on a tabletop near a window.",

      "question": "Is the background softly blurred and contains warm tones such as orange or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image appears to be softly blurred, which is common in photography to create depth and focus on the foreground subject. The colors present in the background include shades of orange and yellow, which are warm tones often associated with natural or artificial lighting. These observations confirm that the background is softly blurred and contains warm tones.",

      "question": "Are there golden sparkles scattered within the snow globe due to sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small, bright spots both inside and around the snow globe, suggesting the presence of sparkles. The overall warm tone of the image, which includes yellows and oranges, implies sunlight filtering through. These details align with a common effect of sunlight creating sparkles inside a translucent object like a snow globe.",

      "question": "Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the snow globe depicted in Image B, the leaf is clearly floating on a liquid surface, evidenced by the ripples around it. Additionally, there are small white specks resembling snowflakes drifting inside the globe. These observations indicate that the leaf is indeed in water with gentle ripples, and the presence of snowflake-like objects enhances this visual detail.",
