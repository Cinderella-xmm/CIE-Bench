      "question": "Is the entire cat composed of crystal materials with no visible fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is constructed entirely from geometric, transparent, and semi-transparent crystal structures with facets and angles, typical of crystal formations. There is no evidence of fur, as the surface is smooth and reflective, indicating it is entirely made of crystal. This aligns with world knowledge that such surfaces reflect light and do not exhibit any fur-like texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body parts of the cat constructed primarily from clear and smoky quartz crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B shows the body parts of the cat are mainly formed from transparent and slightly tinted crystals. The presence of areas that look smoky suggests these are smoky quartz crystals alongside clear quartz to form the bulk of the cat's structure. This conclusion is informed by the appearance and hue typical of these minerals.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are brown and black obsidian accents used to represent the calico pattern on the cat’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays areas on the cat where darker colored crystals represent markings typically seen on calico cats. These markings are shades of brown and black, resembling obsidian, which is known for its deep, dark, glassy appearance. The coloration and glossy surface of these darker areas offer a logical match to obsidian.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cat’s eyes crafted from vibrant green emerald crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the cat's eyes as bright green with depth and luster typical of emerald crystals, known for their vibrant coloration. The depiction suggests the use of such materials due to their characteristic color output when shaped similarly to gemstones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned on a simple, polished wooden block with a smooth surface and no visible decorative features or carvings. The wood's texture indicates it's been finished to a fine sheen typical of polished wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the wooden block appear natural and polished, providing a clear contrast to the crystalline cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The block in Image B exhibits a smooth wooden surface typical of natural materials that have been polished. The contrast is noticeable between the organic texture of the polished wood and the geometric and reflective surface of the crystal cat, highlighting the differences in material.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat sitting with its paws extended forward and the tail curling behind, just as seen in Image A. Despite the material transformation, the basic posture and positioning of the cat's limbs remain consistent, indicating the posture has been preserved.",
