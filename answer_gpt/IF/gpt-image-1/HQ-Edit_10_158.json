    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the hiking boot replaced with a finely carved wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hiking boot appears to be made entirely of wood, with smooth surfaces and texture that mimic the appearance of carved wood, compared to the leather hiking boot seen in Image A. The edges, laces, and overall shape reflect the craftsmanship of a wooden sculpture rather than a functional boot. This indicates the boot's materials are altered significantly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the detailed panels and lacing of the original boot preserved in the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden sculpture retains intricate details that mimic the panels and lacing of a real boot, as seen in Image A. The sculpture's surface features carved sections where panels would typically be, and laces are accurately represented in wood, maintaining the original detail despite the material change.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are light and dark wood tones used to replicate the original leather texture and sole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden sculpture in Image B uses varying wood tones to replicate the textures and colors seen on the leather boot in Image A. The darker tones replicate areas where leather may have been more worn or creased, and lighter tones elsewhere provide color variance similar to the original boot design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden sculpture positioned on a minimalist wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the wooden boot sculpture resting on a simple, light-toned wooden shelf, which emphasizes the material and craftsmanship of the sculpture by providing a neutral backdrop. This differs from Image A, where the boot sits on a natural rock surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are subtle grain patterns visible on the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates clearly visible grain patterns across the surface of the boot sculpture, typical of wood materials. These patterns simulate natural wood grain rather than the varied texture of leather seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the wooden sculpture maintain the robust form of the original hiking boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the overall sturdy form and structure of the hiking boot seen in Image A, including the thickness and shape of the soles, and the high ankle support. Despite being reimagined in wood, the sculpture reflects the original boot's robust design closely.",
