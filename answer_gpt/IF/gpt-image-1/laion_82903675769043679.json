      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure composed of colorful geometric shapes that are reminiscent of cubist art, with the use of fragmented and non-realistic planes. This contrasts with a typical English manor-style house that usually features cohesive architectural elements. The house in Image B uses vibrant colors and broken, angular planes that represent a cubist approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original brick surfaces of the house replaced with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes rather than realistic masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the house forgoes realistic masonry and adopts an abstract art style characterized by non-uniform geometric shapes and vibrant colors. This approach replaces the brick surfaces with varied geometric patterns without specific texture or masonry detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all individuals in the crowd been rendered as abstract, faceless, and scattered forms devoid of detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, individuals are depicted as abstract blobs with vibrant colors rather than detailed human figures. They lack any facial features or distinct human traits, being represented instead as scattered, simplistic forms that do not provide recognizable details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the grass surface feature a visible checkered pattern overlaying the entire green area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B is depicted with a distinct, visible checkered pattern, using contrasting colors to create a geometric effect. This pattern overlays the green area visibly and is not found in realistic grass landscaping but rather in stylistic, artistic depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the water reflection been transformed into a series of prismatic, angular shards that distort and fragment the image of the house and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water reflection is transformed into prismatic, angular fragments that distorts and breaks down the image of the house and surroundings. This is a departure from a smooth, cohesive reflection found in Image A, representing a style consistent with cubism.",
