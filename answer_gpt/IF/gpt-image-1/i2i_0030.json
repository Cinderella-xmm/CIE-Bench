      "question": "Is the original fruit platter photo used as the centerpiece without significant alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fruit platter appears to be an unaltered version of the same one displayed in Image A. The arrangement and kinds of fruits – pineapples, kiwis, apples, watermelon, bananas, oranges, and blueberries – remain consistent.

      "question": "Have decorative green leaf graphics been added around the fruit platter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a green leaf graphic surrounding the fruit platter. The presence of green foliage, framing the platter, is apparent and includes a stylized design that signifies plant life, typically used for decorative purposes. Such elements are absent in Image A, which focuses solely on the platter.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts elements that give an impression of a supermarket packaging style, such as the labeling of 'DAILY VITAMIN C SUPPLY PLATE' and the addition of decorative green graphics, suggesting branding. These features, combined with the tidy arrangement of fruits, imitate ready-to-eat product packaging commonly found in markets.",

      "question": "Is the background styled with a light green gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a uniform light green, rather than exhibiting a gradient. There is no evidence of color transitioning or gradient effect, but rather a consistent shade of light green encasing the image. Image A, in contrast, displays a neutral background with a simple plate without any gradient.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fruits in Image B maintain their color and detail, consistent with Image A. The varied hues of the fruit – the red of the watermelon, the light yellow of the pineapple, the green of the kiwis, and the dark blueberries – are replicated accurately, preserving the vibrant, appealing look as seen in Image A.",
