      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the skier's exact pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's pose can be analyzed in relation to its skiing stance, arms and legs position, the angle of the skis, and the overall dynamism conveyed by the figurine. It features a skier bending slightly forward, with the poles held in a manner similar to skiing action, which resembles the skier's pose in Image A, known from skiing culture. Comparison shows Image A has a skier carving down the slope with similar arm and leg positions as the figurine shown in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the skis designed to be detachable from the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it states 'Detachable Skis' next to the skis separately shown alongside the figurine. This suggests that the design allows for the skis to be attached or detached, which indicates that the skis are not permanently affixed to the figurine.",

      "question": "Is there a magnetic snow powder base attached to the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, there is no clear presence of text or any visual indication next to the figurine suggesting the existence of a 'magnetic snow powder base.' It only shows a base made to resemble snow without mentioning magnetism.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is shown beside packaging labeled 'EXTREME SPORTS,' complete with illustrated graphics depicting skiing and mountainous backgrounds which are commonly used in product packaging to convey context and mood.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the figurine with ski poles, similar to those seen in Image A. The skier had poles in both hands in both images. The backpack from Image A is not evident on the figurine in Image B, suggesting it wasn't included in the design.",
