      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables and knife are depicted using various geometric shapes like triangles, rectangles, and polygons. This is evident from the distinct angular outlines and flat color shapes that form each object. Commonly in art, this transformation into geometric shapes indicates an abstraction style often seen in modern art such as Cubism. Thus, based on the visual cues combined with art knowledge, it's concluded that the vegetables and knife have indeed been broken down into geometric shapes.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Abstract arrangement typically involves a departure from realistic representation, focusing instead on the composition and visual impact of shapes. In Image B, the geometric shapes, while representing the vegetables and knife, are arranged in a way that emphasizes form over accurate likeness, creating an abstract representation. This is supported by the overall abstraction seen in Image B's composition compared to the realistic depiction of Image A.",

      "question": "Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the abstraction and use of geometric shapes in Image B, the general arrangement and color variation align closely with the original object forms—carrots, celery, onions, and a knife—seen in Image A. The color cues (orange for carrots, green for celery, white for onions) and the distinct blade shape help maintain recognition of the elements involved, demonstrating how abstraction can retain identifiable features.",

      "question": "Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is more muted and cohesive, reducing vibrant variations seen in Image A. This simplification often aligns with Cubist style, where a limited, earthly palette is strategically used to orchestrate geometric forms and focus more on angles and shapes rather than vivid colors. As evident from the edited image's palette consistency and alignment with cubist aesthetics, the answer is supported.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B reflects Cubist characteristics by displaying overlapping and intersecting geometric shapes surrounding the vegetables and knife. However, unlike traditional Cubism which often displays multiple perspectives of a single object simultaneously, the image primarily abstracts each object but maintains a single viewpoint. Thus, while aspects of Cubism are noted, the characteristic of multiple perspectives is not distinctly present.",
