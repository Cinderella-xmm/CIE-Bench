      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question has transformed into a cylindrical tea container, visibly different from the rounded shape seen in Image A. This conclusion is drawn from the distinct vertical form in Image B, typical of cylindrical objects, without any spout or handle, unlike the traditional teapot shape observed in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are floral patterns embossed in golden foil on the surface of the teapot container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays floral patterns prominently featuring golden foil, applied with precision and texture, which is assumed to be a decorative technique using golden materials. This contrasts with Image A, where the floral design is painted rather than embossed with foil.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the teacups redesigned as nested stackable units, each with a decorative lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays three teacups, each equipped with a decorative lid stacked vertically, indicating a specific design for compact storage or presentation. This setup is visually distinct from Image A, where individual teacups are displayed separately without lids.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there Japanese calligraphy displayed across the top of the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical container clearly shows Japanese characters placed prominently near the top, suggesting branding or thematic identification. Image A lacks any written language, focusing instead on the visual design elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a bamboo motif along the side of the cylindrical container, adding an element of nature to the design as frequently seen in Japanese-inspired aesthetics. Image A does not have this particular pattern, emphasizing floral motifs instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire tea set packaging presented on a flat white surface with no other background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea set packaging is displayed on a simple flat white surface, accompanied by no other background elements, providing a minimalist presentation. Image A contrasts with a textured mat and traditional screen background, offering a more complex setting.",
