        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows four separate panels, each featuring a gymnast in a unique pose. The consistent art style, color palette, and thematic elements like stars and dynamic lines suggest a cohesive set. The organization and format resemble a postcard set and the presence of multiple panels aligns with how such collectibles are usually presented. Thus, the image depicts a multi-panel postcard set with a gymnastics theme.",
