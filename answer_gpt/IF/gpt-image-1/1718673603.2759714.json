      "question": "Are all structural elements of the Japanese house rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black lead lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, visual cues indicate that the Japanese house is transformed into a stained glass style, with its structure outlined in black lines characteristic of lead came used in stained glass. This is evident as each section of the house appears segmented, and colored glass panels fill the spaces in between, consistent with stained glass art. Therefore, all structural elements adhere to this style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized floral motifs made of red and green segmented glass pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of red trees, there are stylized floral motifs visible. These floral motifs are created using different segments of colored glass that combine red for the flowers and green for the leaves, set in a stained-glass style. This transformation from trees to flowers follows the motif replacement specified in the question, as observed in these changes to the red elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the large red moon rendered using multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is depicted with a large, singular red circle divided into concentric sections. However, it does not demonstrate overlapping circles but rather segments of different shades within one large circle, akin to concentric circles typical in stained glass. This is not the same as multiple overlapping circles, which the question specifically mentions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all major elements (house, trees, moon) clearly outlined with thick, black, continuous lines resembling lead came in stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each primary element—including the house, floral motifs where trees were, and the moon—is outlined with thick, black lines that resemble the leading in stained glass art. This style of outlining unifies the image into a classic stained glass aesthetic, clearly differentiating individual segments of colored glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene maintain the original composition (house centered, trees flanking, moon above, water in foreground) while all elements are styled as stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B retains the core layout seen in Image A. The house remains centered, the floral motifs that replaced the trees are on either side, the moon is positioned at the top, and water is at the bottom foreground. Each element follows a stained-glass artistic style, but the scene's structure remains consistent with the original composition of Image A.",
