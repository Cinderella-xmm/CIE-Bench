      "question": "Does the paint splatter texture now depict iconic New York cityscapes or abstract urban art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a skyline silhouette of New York City at night with recognizable skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building. This imagery directly references New York Cityscapes, unlike an abstract paint splatter pattern typically associated with urban art. Therefore, the change from Image A's abstract splatter to the detailed cityscape in Image B indicates the depiction of iconic cityscapes.",

      "question": "Has the white electric guitar been redesigned to represent a musical style or era resonant with New York City?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hollow-body jazz guitar, replacing the original white electric guitar. Hollow-body guitars are commonly associated with jazz music, which is historically significant and resonant with New York City, particularly in areas like Manhattan and Harlem. This change clearly links to the city's jazz era, resonating with the musical style of that time.",

      "question": "Does the overall design aesthetic reflect gritty subway art, sophisticated jazz age graphics, or bold modern typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B has a vintage feel with sepia tones and a 1920s-30s style jazz guitar, which aligns with the sophisticated graphics of the jazz age. The cityscape with lights resembles a classic Art Deco theme, often associated with this era, known for its elegance and sophistication. This contrasts with the modern, bold typography or gritty subway art themes.",
