    "Question": "Q1: Are the bicycles depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles have exaggerated and simplified features characteristic of chibi style, such as larger and rounder parts, softer edges, and a playful, cartoonish appearance.

    "Question": "Q4: Do the bicycles retain their original design details?",
    "explanation": "While Image A features bicycles with detailed elements such as gears, chains, and realistic frame proportions, Image B simplifies these into a chibi style with fewer details and more stylized features.
