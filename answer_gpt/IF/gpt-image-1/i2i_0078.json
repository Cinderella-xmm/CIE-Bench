      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a steampunk-style train station waiting room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is distinct from typical modern interiors and showcases elements commonly associated with steampunk aesthetic such as historical architecture, ornate design features, and lighting reminiscent of old-fashioned lamps. This style often incorporates Victorian-era motifs with industrial elements, supporting the inference that the background resembles a steampunk train station waiting room.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original lighting and shadows on the wristwatch preserved after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch appears well-lit, reflecting a warm lighting similar to that found in the train station setting. Given the stark visual differences in lighting between Image A (modern indoor lighting) and Image B (warm, atmospheric lighting), it indicates that the original lighting and shadows are not preserved in the wristwatch presentation, adapting instead to the new environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the new background contain steampunk elements such as gears, metallic textures, or vintage train station features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits features such as rounded arches, industrial-style lamps, and ornate wooden benches, which are indicative of steampunk design combining historical elements with industrial motifs. Despite the absence of visible gears, the overall aesthetic supports the inclusion of vintage or steampunk-like characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch remains at the forefront, maintaining its details, shape, and clarity. Its positioning on a wooden surface highlights it against the complex background, ensuring its prominence and lack of distortion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B suggests a vintage or industrial setting, specific elements like steam trains or clockwork devices are not visible. The environment and aesthetic imply an industrial influence but do not display these items directly.",
