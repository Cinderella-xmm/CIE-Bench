      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the forest background been replaced with a city balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a city with prominent buildings that are blurred, which is characteristic of a city skyline as opposed to a forest setting. The bird is sitting on a horizontal rail, suggesting a man-made balcony structure, which further supports the idea of a city balcony setting rather than a natural forest environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird positioned on the sunlit balcony as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is perched on a railing that appears to be part of a balcony, with lighting that suggests sunlight since the bird and railing are brightly illuminated, commonly seen in sunlit settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a blurred city skyline visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background contains a series of blurred vertical structures that resemble buildings, which are typical elements of a city skyline as opposed to any natural landscape. The blurring effect gives depth to the image, consistent with distant urban structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird maintain its original position relative to the new balcony railing background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird's posture and positioning in Image B appear similar to its orientation in Image A. In both images, the bird is looking toward the same direction with its body oriented similarly; however, the background settings have changed from natural to man-made, indicating it maintains its relative position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall lighting of the image match the sunlit balcony setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears warm and bright, corresponding to lighting conditions typical of a sunlit balcony during sunrise or sunset. The bird and railing are distinctly illuminated, creating a shadow that suggests direct sunlight exposure.",
