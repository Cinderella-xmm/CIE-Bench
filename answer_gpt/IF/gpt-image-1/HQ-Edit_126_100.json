      "question": "Does the house appear as a sentient, mythical treehouse creature rather than a conventional dwelling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure resembles a mythical creature, characterized by a central large eye and limbs made of what appear to be roots, rather than a conventional house. The visual cues suggest a living entity rather than inanimate architecture, indicating the presence of creativity and fantasy elements. Combining this with knowledge of mythical entities, it's evident that the structure is designed to appear sentient.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns replaced with detailed, leg-like wooden structures resembling limbs or roots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the support structures beneath the main body of the structure resemble limbs made of wood or roots, detailed to suggest movement and liveliness. This contrasts with the traditional support columns found in conventional architecture. The appearance of these leg-like forms implies a transformation from functional supports to organic, limb-like structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the straw roof been replaced by an overgrowth of realistic leafy branches forming a natural canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top section of the structure showcases an extension of leafy branches, creating a cohesive canopy similar to that of a large tree. This is a significant departure from the traditional straw roof seen in regular buildings. The depiction mimics a tree, contributing to the overall natural and mythical appearance of the structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish transformed into a large, lidless eye with visible iris and pupil features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the satellite dish from Image A has been creatively transformed into a prominent eye located centrally on the structure. The depiction includes a clear iris and pupil, attributing a lifelike and fantastical quality to the structure, as opposed to the technological purpose of a satellite dish. This transformation enhances the mythical creature narrative of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the exterior walls fully covered with detailed, textured patterns resembling natural tree bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior surfaces of the structure exhibit textures and patterns reminiscent of natural tree bark. This contrasts with the woven bamboo appearance typical of traditional or nature-inspired dwellings, suggesting an integration of natural elements into the design to reinforce the tree-like appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the orange blossoms emit a visible soft glow or aura around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the orange blossoms are present, there is no apparent visual indication of a glow or aura emanating from them. The flowers appear normal in their visual representation without the addition of any mystical or supernatural glowing effect typically associated with fantastical or animated depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there long, trailing vines descending from the treehouse, giving it an organic, flowing appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no evident trailing vines descending from the structure. The limbs themselves resemble roots and are inherent to the transformation of the support columns. However, no additional trailing vine structures contributing to an organic, flowing appearance are observed extending downwards.",
