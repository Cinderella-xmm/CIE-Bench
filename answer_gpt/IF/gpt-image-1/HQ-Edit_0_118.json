      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a soft, flattened art postcard style with reduced realism and enhanced serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases characteristics typical of an art postcard style, such as the simplified forms, soft color transitions, and a reduction in detailed realism. The serenity is enhanced through a harmonious color palette and gentle tones, differing starkly from the realism seen in Image A.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the woman’s figure exhibit visible watercolor characteristics such as translucent washes, soft blending, and brushstroke textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s figure is rendered in a manner that suggests watercolor painting techniques. There are apparent translucent washes and soft blending of colors, indicative of watercolor artistry. This contrasts the sharp and photographic realism in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the drapes of the woman’s robe visibly elongated compared to their original length in the source image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When observing Image B, the robe appears to have more flowing, elongated drapes compared to Image A, where the fabric is more tailored and constrained. The artistic elongation of elements, like the robe, is a common stylization feature in illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays botanical patterns woven into the fabric of the woman's robe, including leaves and possibly flowers. These intricate designs are absent in Image A, indicating a purposeful artistic embellishment in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an atmospheric depiction where light seems to diffuse through tree leaves, creating a soft dappled effect on the overall scene. This effect is more stylized and is crafted through the artful interplay of light and shadow, unlike the more direct sunlight in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The open book in Image B notably consists of leaf-shaped outlines rather than typical text, while maintaining the general layout seen in Image A. This alteration reflects a thematic design choice towards botanical elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there subtle literary motifs such as small book icons, feathers, or script elements incorporated into the border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
