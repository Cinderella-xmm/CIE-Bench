      "question": "Is the individual depicted within a Funko Pop figure box in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure box is presented with a slightly angled perspective, which is typical for isometric designs. Isometric perspective typically involves showing the top of the object slightly and having equal angles for viewing the sides. This helps viewers appreciate both the front and the side of the box, which is evident from the image.",
