      "question": "Are there six chibi-style figures depicted in the image, arranged as a nesting doll set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a series of chibi-style figures arranged similarly to nesting dolls. There are five visible dolls, placed one next to the other, not one inside the other as traditional nesting dolls. The term 'nesting doll' can imply a set of dolls in decreasing size, but here they are arranged linearly and not nested.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the six dolls arranged in decreasing size order, with each one visibly smaller than the previous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the dolls are arranged in a line on a surface. There are five dolls visible, and they indeed appear in decreasing size order from left to right, but not nested inside one another. Since there are only five dolls visible, this makes it impossible for there to be six as the question states.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all six dolls wear attire featuring vibrant orange and blue colors consistent with the original figure's clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire of the chibi-style figures closely matches the original's clothing, with noticeable similar patterns and colors, predominantly orange and blue, which are consistent with the attire in the original image. However, only five dolls are depicted here.",

      "question": "Are the dolls placed on a dark-wood desk with a smooth, polished appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface that the dolls are placed on appears to be made of wood with a dark finish, showing a smooth and polished texture. This is evident from the uniform sheen and wood grain details visible on the surface.",

      "question": "Are the robes of the dolls slightly swaying or distorted to suggest a gentle breeze effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the robes of the dolls do not show any signs of distortion or swaying that would suggest the presence of a breeze. They appear to be static and neatly arranged, consistent with a posed display.",
