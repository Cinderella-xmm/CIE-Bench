      "question": "Has the image been converted into a realistic cartoon rendering style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a truck depicted in a simple and bold cartoon style, with clear outlines and blocks of flat color without shading or complex lighting effects. This is in contrast to the more realistic representation typically characterized by detailed textures and shading. The truck in Image B lacks realistic elements like reflections and gradient shading, which are present in Image A, indicating a shift to a cartoon style.",

      "question": "Does the truck retain its original structure in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck features components like wheels, exhaust pipes, and a cabin that match the structure of a truck. Image A also depicts a truck with a similar configuration in terms of basic shape and parts placement. The essential structure of the truck, including the shape of the cabin and placement of the wheels, remains consistent between the two images despite the change in artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the lines in the truck bolder compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits bolder outlines around the truck, emphasizing its shape with prominent black lines that define the edges of each component distinctly. In Image A, lines are more subtle and less pronounced due to the realistic rendering approach. This shift to bolder lines is typical in cartoon or comic art styles to simplify and emphasize shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the colors in the image been made more vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the truck with bright and saturated colors, enhancing its visual impact. This is a common feature in cartoon styles to make images stand out and appear lively. In contrast, Image A has more subdued and realistic color tones befitting a natural environment, lacking the exaggerated saturation seen in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is simplified to basic shapes with clear outlines and flat colors, lacking detailed textures and shading seen in Image A. Trees and clouds are depicted with minimal detail and uniform color, providing a stylized backdrop typical of cartoon art, whereas Image A includes textured details and naturalistic shading, indicating a simplification in Image B.",
