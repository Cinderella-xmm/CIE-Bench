      "question": "Does the spider now appear as a mythical dream-weaver rather than a realistic spider?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual features such as iridescent wings, a luminous orb abdomen, and an ethereal glow contribute to a mythical appearance. These attributes are characteristic of a fantastical creature, diverging significantly from the realistic spider seen in Image A. Thus, the spider in Image B resembles a mythical dream-weaver more than a realistic spider.",
