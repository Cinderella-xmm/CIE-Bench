      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B display a chibi-style wombat, which is characterized by exaggerated features like large, expressive eyes and a proportionally larger head to body size, further contributing to a gentle and cute appearance. This is a common stylistic choice in character stickers to enhance appeal. The facial expressions in the stickers, such as tears, sleeping 'z's, and sparkling effects, emphasize the gentle and expressive nature of the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reference provided by Image A features only one pose of a wombat sitting in a chair with a drink. In Image B, the stickers show the wombat in four distinct poses and expressions within the frames. Given the task's constraint, and the fact that Image B only shows four poses, it does not have six poses. Hence, based solely on Image B, there are not six distinct poses presented.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is depicted wearing a Hawaiian shirt with the same color pattern and a straw hat, aligning with typical vacation attire, as seen in the reference Image A. The shirt's color and pattern, along with the straw hat, match the fun and relaxed style often associated with tropical regions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features backgrounds with tropical elements such as hibiscus flowers and palm fronds, drawing a connection to tropical environments. However, there are no visible fruity drink designs in the backgrounds of the stickers. The focus is primarily on the tropical flora rather than beverages.",

      "question": "Are the stickers designed with a dimension ratio of 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B are arranged in a grid of four separate images, each occupying an equal amount of space on a square layout. This setup does not conform to the 9:16 aspect ratio, which is a vertical format used primarily for modern smartphone displays. The stickers are arranged in a manner suggesting a more square-like aspect ratio.",
