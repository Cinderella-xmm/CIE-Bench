      "question": "Has the black bottle cap been replaced with a transparent or translucent glass stopper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the bottle features a transparent or translucent glass stopper, which is characterized by its clear material allowing light to pass through, distinguishing it visually from the solid black cap seen in the original image (Image A). This change is consistent with typical fragrance diffuser designs, which often use glass stoppers for aesthetic purposes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows thin, dark-colored reeds protruding from the top of the bottle.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label in Image B does not exhibit typical art deco features such as geometric, symmetrical patterns or stylized fonts.
