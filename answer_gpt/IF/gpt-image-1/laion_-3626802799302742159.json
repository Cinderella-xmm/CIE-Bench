      "question": "Are expressive faces and limbs added to the cookies to make them anthropomorphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies are depicted with facial expressions and limbs, which are common visual elements used to convey anthropomorphism.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited Image B, distinct facial expressions are noticeable on the cookies: one cookie is grinning, another is pouting as evidenced by its sad mouth and slightly furrowed brow, and a third is winking, which is captured by one eye being closed in a playful manner. These varied expressions are key in adding personality to each cookie.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small tea table and a teapot can be observed, along with a teacup, suggesting a tea party scene. Such props are traditionally associated with tea parties and serve to create a setting where anthropomorphic characters might gather, typically seen in whimsical illustrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the cup retains its original form and is not altered to resemble a clubhouse or any other architectural structure. It includes anthropomorphic cookies sitting around it and one inside of it, yet no architectural elements such as windows or doors are added to transform the cup into a clubhouse.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a floral-patterned item takes the place of the original pink plate seen in Image A. This item resembles a picnic blanket, fitting into a playful tea party scene, contrasting with the solid-color plate originally functioning as a serving surface.",
