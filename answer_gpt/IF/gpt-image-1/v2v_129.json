        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the stickers don't seem to follow a strict square shape; rather, they take on irregular forms that specifically suit their design, such as rounded outlines. Therefore, they do not adhere to a consistent 1:1 aspect ratio.",
