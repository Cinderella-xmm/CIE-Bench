      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly enclosed within a transparent glass dome. The dome is visible as it covers the teapot and cups, acting as a display case. This conclusion is drawn from the distinct presence of a curved, clear surface above and around the teapot. Commonly, such glass domes are used for protective display purposes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot resting on a base that reflects the small porcelain cups arranged around it and part of the teapot, indicating the base is indeed reflective and possibly mirrored. The clarity of the reflections suggests that the base is mirrored, which is a typical choice for display settings to enhance visual appeal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays several small porcelain cups around the teapot, arranged symmetrically in a circular pattern on the mirrored base. This arrangement is consistent with typical display setups where complementary items are positioned around the central piece for aesthetic balance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B shows intricate engravings. However, without comparison, the question asks about additional engravings that enhance patterns beyond the original visible ones. The designs are consistent and match the original nature of detailed engravings typical of ornate teapots, but no new patterns appear to amplify the base design beyond its original form.",

      "question": "Are there visible faux steam spirals rising upward from the teapot, forming curved, wispy trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes decorative elements resembling steam spirals made from a material rising from the teapot's spout and lid area. These faux steam spirals are visually distinct, positioned within the glass dome, and appear as artistic additions meant to mimic steam, which is a common decorative motif for teapots in displays.",
