      "question": "Is the black Axe Spiked Up Look Putty container visibly cracked open?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black container for Axe Spiked Up Look Putty is seen with cracks, indicating it is open or broken. Visual cues such as the jagged edges around the top of the container suggest it is no longer intact. This observation leads to the conclusion that the container is cracked open.",

      "question": "Does the container reveal a vibrant miniature nebula inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cracked Axe container reveals a glowing and swirling pattern of colors and shapes, resembling a nebula. The presence of cosmic visual elements and the glowing aesthetic inside the container are characteristics of a nebula. Combining these visual cues with knowledge of astronomical phenomena, the internal design can be identified as a miniature nebula.",

      "question": "Does the nebula contain fiery red and energetic pink hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the nebula with dominant colors such as fiery reds and energetic pinks, which are vibrant and energetic by nature. The swirling formations within the nebula enhance its dynamic appeal and emphasize these specific hues. Visual observation confirms the presence of fiery red and pink shades.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the nebula's colors match the fiery red and energetic pink hues from the abstract explosive design on the original label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, both feature fiery red and pink hues, but in different contexts. Image A uses these colors in an abstract explosive design on the label, while Image B displays them in a nebula form inside the container. The similarity in colors between both images suggests they match, despite the differing representationâ€”as label artwork versus cosmic nebula. The shared color palette signifies thematic continuity.",

      "question": "Is the nebula set against a backdrop of distant stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nebula against a dark background, scattered with numerous points of light which resemble stars. This cosmic arrangement is characteristic of an astronomical setting where nebulae often appear against star-laden skies. Observing the small, bright specifications in the background confirms the presence of stars, setting the scene within a space context.",
