      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bow depicted as a folded origami paper design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow has clear angular shapes and visible folds typical of origami designs. The lack of smooth curves and realistic textures suggests it is made of paper and folded into shape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arrows in the quiver depicted as folded origami paper designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrows in Image B exhibit angular shapes and defined creases, indicative of origami designs. They lack the rounded form and material texture found in realistic arrows, supporting the conclusion that they are folded paper designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the woodland backdrop retain its natural appearance without any artificial alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears natural with realistic details such as moss and trees. There are no visible alterations that suggest artificial manipulation of this part of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and positioning of the bow and quiver remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the composition in both images, the bow and quiver maintain their positions and orientation relative to each other, with spatial elements unchanged except transitioning from realistic to origami representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bow and quiver show clear paper folds and lack realistic material textures such as wood or leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow and quiver feature distinct angular and folded shapes typical of origami, without the textures associated with materials like wood or leather, which were present in Image A.",
