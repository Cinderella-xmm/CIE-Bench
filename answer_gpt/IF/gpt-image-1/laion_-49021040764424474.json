      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is visibly constructed from LEGO bricks, which are known for their distinct interlocking shapes. The colors used for the bricks are orange, black, and silver, corresponding to different parts of the truck's body, including the exterior, mirrors, and rooftop. This information can be gleaned from the characteristic shapes and colors of LEGO bricks, and their use in creating models. In comparison, Image A shows a real vehicle made from standard automotive materials like metal and glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wheels that appear to be made from circular gray LEGO pieces, as indicated by the uniformity in color and the typical blocky appearance of LEGO components. This differs from Image A, where the wheels consist of real tires and rims made from rubber and metal, providing functionality which is absent in toy models.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a truck bed that is covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, characterized by the flat, glossy surface typical of LEGO pieces. The uniformity of the surface suggests the use of tiles rather than a textured design. In comparison, Image A has a textured truck bed, which is common in practical vehicles for grip and usability.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is shown on a plain white surface typical of a shelf, which raises it above the ground, suggesting it is part of a display rather than functional use. This can be inferred from the flatness, color, and the typical appearance of such background environments used in product displays. Image A shows the truck in a realistic outdoor scene with a gravel ground, indicating its functional purpose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the correct shape and proportions of the original pickup truck, including the cab, bed, and wheelbase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes LEGO bricks to recreate the pickup truck's shape and proportions, taking into account the cab, bed, and wheelbase, which appear consistent with those in Image A. Despite the limitations in detail due to the medium, LEGO models often aim to preserve approximate dimensions and recognizable features of the original objects they emulate, even if they appear more blocky or stylized.",
