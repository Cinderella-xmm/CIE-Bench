      "question": "Have the cheetahs' leg joints been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' legs are depicted as mechanical constructs with evident brass elements in the form of pistons and gears, which are visual indicators of a steampunk or robotic design rather than biological features. From world knowledge, the brass and mechanical elements are associated with machinery and steampunk aesthetics. Hence, it indicates that the cheetahs' leg joints have been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears.",

      "question": "Has the cheetahs' spotted fur been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, parts of the cheetahs' bodies show textures and colors that align with leather and copper. This can be seen on their body sections which are segmented into mechanical parts instead of natural fur, resembling tooled leather and copper plating commonly seen in steampunk and crafted designs. Based on world knowledge, such materials are typically used in creating intricate mechanical and aesthetic designs. Thus, the cheetahs' spotted fur has been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating.",

      "question": "Have the cheetahs' eyes been replaced with glowing amber lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs have eyes that appear to glow with an intense amber hue, resembling lens-like structures rather than the natural eyes found in Image A. This suggests that in the edited image, the eyes have been replaced with glowing amber elements, which is a typical feature in fantasy or sci-fi art encompassing creatures with enhanced or mechanical attributes.",

      "question": "Are there towering, fantastical clockwork structures visible in the distant savanna horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon features tall structures that are visually complex and resemble clockwork mechanisms with gears and towers, indicative of a fantastical and mechanical style. Such structures are not commonly found in natural landscapes and align with themes of science fiction and fantasy settings. These towers are an addition of imaginative elements, implying their presence in the edited image. Therefore, there are indeed towering, fantastical clockwork structures visible in the distant savanna horizon.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky displays clouds with a distinct coppery coloration, unusual for natural weather phenomena. This hue matches the tones often used in steampunk art, providing a cohesive thematic atmosphere with the mechanical modifications seen in the image. Comparing this to the original and typical sky colors, the edited image shows intentionally copper-toned clouds, indicating they are present.",
