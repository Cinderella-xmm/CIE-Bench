      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, features a halftone pattern, which is a common printing technique used in comic art and pop art to create shades and gradients through the use of dots.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image employs bright, bold colors such as yellow, red, blue, and black, which are sharply defined and stand in stark contrast to each other, creating visual interest and making the elements, like the soccer ball and goalpost, clearly stand out against the background. These vivid contrasts are characteristic of styles like pop art, enhancing the dynamic nature of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball and goalpost are rendered with clean lines and distinct edges, which are typical in graphic styles like comic or pop art. The edges are drawn with uniform outlines, making each component precise and well-defined, which is crucial for visual clarity and impact in such styles.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, both the soccer ball and goalpost are simplified into bold, graphic shapes with clear outlines and a limited palette, yet they remain easily recognizable. The transformation to iconic representations is a hallmark of this type of graphic design, ensuring that while details are minimized, the fundamental identity of the objects is preserved.",
