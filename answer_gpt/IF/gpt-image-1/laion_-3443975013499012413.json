      "question": "Has the wooden material been replaced with transparent blue and teal crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material of the sculpture is a transparent blue and teal crystalline substance, different from typical wood texture. This transformation suggests a shift from a solid and opaque material to one that has a translucent quality, which is typical for crystalline structures. By observing the properties of the material such as color transparency and light reflection inherent in crystals or glass-like materials, it can be concluded that the material has been replaced from wood to a crystalline substance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the facets and angles of the sculpture accurately represent the fish's scales and curved body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a fish sculpture with distinct facets and angles that offer a gem-like appearance. These facets can mimic the scales of a fish with angular and reflective qualities, approximating the natural texture of scales and the dynamic curves of a fish’s body. The cut and shape intricacies evoke the undulating body structure of a fish, making them an accurate representation in this medium.",

      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit glossy, reflective surfaces that suggest water-like fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the fish sculpture in Image B is shown as glossy with reflective properties, typical of polished glass or polished crystal. This quality emulates the fluidity and sheen associated with water, as reflections and a glossy appearance are similar to surface characteristics observed in liquid mediums. This connection between appearance and water-like fluidity is apparent from the reflections and sheen visible on the surface.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture presented in a minimalist white gallery space with no visible distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a white gallery space characterized by its plain and unadorned walls, creating a minimalistic setting. No additional objects or decorations are evident to detract from the main focus, which is the sculpture itself. This setup in galleries highlights the art by reducing visual noise, aligning with minimalism’s principles.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture mounted on a sleek, mirrored pedestal that reflects its image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pedestal in Image B is described as having a mirrored surface, sleek in appearance, which is evident from the reflection of the sculpture itself. This reflective platform serves to enhance the crystalline sculpture's impact by reinforcing visual elements such as form and color through reflection, making the pedestal both functional and enhancing the sculpture's visual presentation.",
