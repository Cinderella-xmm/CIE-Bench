    "Question": "Q2: Have the tomato slices been replaced with grilled pineapple slices?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the composition of the sandwich, the top visible layer is a ring of pineapple with grill marks, indicating it has been grilled. In contrast, a typical sandwich might feature common toppings like tomatoes. Therefore, the presence of distinct pineapple slices suggests a switch from tomatoes, typical in various cuisine styles where pineapple may be preferred for its sweet and unique flavor.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the pineapple slices appear grilled, showing char marks or a browned exterior?",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the flag sit properly on top of the sandwich without disrupting its composition?",
    "explanation": "The flag in Image B is neatly placed on the top bun of the sandwich. It stands upright and does not appear to tilt or cause any part of the sandwich to lean or fall apart. This proper placement suggests an aesthetic addition rather than a structural one, which often is designed to maintain overall balance while adding visual interest.",
