      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B is box-shaped with a clear window on the front, allowing a view of the product inside. It is labeled with large text and features prominently the toy inside, similar to how Funko Pop figure boxes are designed. These visual cues align with the common packaging style of Funko Pop figures, which are known for having a distinct front window and clear branding with collectible figures inside.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' is clearly printed on the front and side of the box in bold, all-caps lettering. This is easily readable and distinctly visible, indicating it is the name or theme of the product inside the packaging.",

      "question": "Is the packaging illustrated from an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B appears to be shown slightly from above and at an angle, providing a three-dimensional view which allows us to see the front and one of the sides. This perspective gives a sense of depth and placement in space, which is typical of an isometric perspective.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bandage toy inside the packaging in Image B is styled in a chibi fashion, characterized by features such as large, exaggerated eyes and a small, simplistic body with oversized stitching around the edges and a cartoonish adhesive area. This styling fits the typical characteristics of chibi design, which focuses on cuteness with exaggerated or simplified features.",

      "question": "Is there a realistic version of the bandage displayed outside the packaging, showing intricate details like fabric texture and adhesive surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bandage figure outside the box designed in a chibi style as well, with no indication of a realistic version presented. The figure outside matches the chibi style of the bandage inside, with exaggerated features rather than realistic details like fabric texture or adhesive surface found in a real bandage.",
