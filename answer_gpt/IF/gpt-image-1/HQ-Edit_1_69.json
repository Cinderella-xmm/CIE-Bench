      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain multiple distinct postcard-style panels depicting the woman in different dynamic poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several panels arranged in a grid format, each featuring the woman in a similar setting but with slight variations in pose. This presentation style mimics that of a postcard collection, where each panel can be considered a distinct postcard representing different snapshots in various dynamic poses.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red dress and black leather jacket outlined with bold, thick lines and rendered in highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted with a red dress and black leather jacket that are outlined in thick lines. The colors in the image are vivid and saturated, creating a bold visual style reminiscent of graphic novels or comic art, where such features are commonly used.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there at least three different dynamic poses shown—such as walking, looking at neon signs, and browsing shop windows—in the postcard series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The postcard-style panels in Image B feature the woman in slightly different poses. These include variations such as walking and gesturing. However, there are not clearly three distinct dynamic poses like looking at neon signs or browsing shop windows. The subtlety of the variations doesn't strongly imply these particular actions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire set of postcards presented within a black slipcase that has a silver foil embossed cityscape design on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a black object that appears to be a slipcase or folder adjacent to the postcards. It features a cityscape design embossed in a way that suggests the use of silver foil. This indicates that the postcards are either presented with or next to this designed slipcase.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there comic-style visual elements such as panel borders, speech bubbles, or motion lines present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panels themselves mimic comic-style presentation with defined borders separating each postcard. However, there are no apparent speech bubbles or motion lines, which are typical elements found in comics to convey dialogue or action dynamics.",
