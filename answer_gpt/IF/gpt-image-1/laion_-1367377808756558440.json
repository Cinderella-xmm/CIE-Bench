      "question": "Is the entire naval scene enclosed within a visible vintage glass lantern structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the naval scene is indeed encased within a glass lantern. The glass structure and metal frame of the lantern are clearly visible, enclosing the scene and providing a vintage feel. This design choice combines visual cues like the nested setting with world knowledge of lanterns as display objects for miniatures.",

      "question": "Does the ship feature brass-colored finishes and visible rotating gears as part of its mechanical design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ship that has brass-colored finishes, which is evident from its metallic sheen and gold-tone appearance. Additionally, rotating gears are explicitly visible within the mechanical design, aligning with steampunk aesthetics. This contrasts typical naval ship features seen in Image A, which is devoid of such embellishments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the figures on the dock replaced with metal automatons wearing Victorian-style attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures that are present on the dock are stylized as metal automatons in Victorian-era attire, which is reflected in the stiff poses and metallic textures. They deviate from the real human figures found in Image A, which depicts people in contemporary clothing walking on a dock.",

      "question": "Are there visible floating steam clouds inside the lantern, adding dynamic movement to the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, floating steam clouds are present around the ship, contributing to the scene's dynamism and creating a sense of motion, crucial to steampunk artistic elements. This contrasts with Image A where such dynamic features are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable oversized compass visible in the background of the scene, along with stylized maritime flags attached to the ship. These elements contribute to a layered thematic depth that is missing in Image A, where the flags and compasses are standard and less pronounced.",
