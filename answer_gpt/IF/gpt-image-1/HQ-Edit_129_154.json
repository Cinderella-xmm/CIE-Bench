    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall shape of the object is clearly an owl. The distinct features of an owl such as a rounded head, prominent eyes, feather-like patterns covering the body, and a perched stance on a branch are all evident. These characteristics do not align with the traditional shape of a teapot, which typically features a spout and handle, and lacks a defined animal shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lid of the original teapot form the crown-like head of the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lid of the original teapot in Image A has an ornamental, domed shape. In Image B, this lid appears atop the owl's head, functioning as its crown-like head. This is evident from its placement and how it's integrated with the owl figure's head, continuing its ornamental style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original engravings now transformed into metallic feather-like patterns covering the owl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's body is detailed with intricate patterns that mimic feathers, similar to the engravings on the original teapot. The patterns maintain the metallic, ornamental style but are organized in a way that resembles the layered arrangement of feathers on an owl.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been reshaped into a sharp, mechanical beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spout of the teapot in Image A is a protruding, curved element. In Image B, there is a sharp, mechanical-looking beak where the spout would conceptually transform, suggesting a reshaping into a beak to fit the owl's anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a gracefully curved tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image A and Image B, the handle of the teapot, which is typically curved, appears to have been reimagined as the tail of the owl in Image B. The tail exhibits a flowing, curved design similar to a handle while aligning with natural anatomy of an owl's tail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two glowing eyes made of cogs visible on the owl's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the owl prominently features two eyes that appear to be constructed from cogs, which emit a glowing light. This suggests that they are designed to be mechanical, enhancing the steampunk aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned on a richly carved wooden branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl in Image B is depicted perched on a branch that shows detailed, textured patterns reminiscent of woodcarving, providing a naturalistic base for the owl figure.",
