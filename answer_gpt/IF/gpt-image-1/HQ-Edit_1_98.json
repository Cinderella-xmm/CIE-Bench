        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the view through the window as a painted landscape with swirling patterns. The swirling clouds and abstract nature of the sky suggest an artistic rendition rather than a realistic portrayal, transforming the outdoor scene to be more imaginative and less defined as compared to potential real-life views.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual examination of the violin does not reveal any gold inlays. The sepia tone might make it challenging to identify specific colors, but based on the patterns and detailing visible on the violin, it lacks marked gold embellishments.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the left border, there's a visible decorative music score. This appears in the form of notes and other musical notations neatly drawn, which is consistent with a creative border that complements the vintage theme by presenting it as part of the frame.",
