        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is shown within a clear display case, typical for models, suggesting it's a miniature rather than full-sized. The setting indicates it's a collectible model. Thus, based on these cues, yes, the robot is now a miniature 3D model.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are panels and components on the robot, but none visibly have tiny gears under transparent panels. Thus, no transparent panels or tiny gears are evident on the robot’s surface.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the display case resting on a black base with hexagonal sides. Hexagonal bases are often used for more stability and visual appeal in collectibles. Hence, yes, the display is on a hexagonal black base.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a miniaturized landscape around the display that reflects the original scene’s elements (e.g., trees, terrain, distant city)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the display case in Image B, there are elements like small trees and a terrain base. However, no distant city is visible or identifiable in the scene. Thus, there is a miniaturized landscape around the display, but it doesn't fully reflect all elements of the original scene.",
