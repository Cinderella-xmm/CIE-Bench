      "question": "Is the spaceship visually transformed into a style resembling a Greek amphora painting, with flat, stylized forms and decorative borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a Greek amphora-style painting characterized by flat, stylized designs and decorative patterns typical of such art. It bears no resemblance to a spaceship, which would traditionally have more three-dimensional and mechanical features. The visual cues in Image B show a vase-like object with decorative motifs and borders, consistent with Greek art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible stylized circular motifs incorporated into the design of the spaceship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object features circular motifs which are prominently displayed on the amphora. These are typical decorative elements found in Greek pottery art, unlike traditional spaceship designs which don't commonly feature such motifs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spaceship include intricate meander patterns as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The amphora in Image B contains intricate meander patterns, especially above the circular motifs. Such patterns are common in Greek art, adding to the amphora's ornamental aesthetic. These patterns differ markedly from any design on traditional spacecraft.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the landscape below been transformed into elongated abstract waveforms rather than realistic terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part consists of elongated waveforms that mimic water or air flow, typical of ancient pottery painting styles. Such abstract designs replace the realistic terrain seen in Image A. This transformation aligns with the Greek-inspired artistic treatment applied to the entire scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the color palette of the landscape composed primarily of muted earth tones consistent with ancient pottery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a color palette that consists of muted earth tones such as browns and beiges, consistent with the hues typically found in ancient pottery. This is a departure from the more natural landscape colors that one might expect to see in a realistic depiction such as grass green or sky blue.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the stylistic elements have changed to match a Greek pottery style, the amphora seems to float above the abstract waves much like the original spaceship floated above the landscape in Image A. This suggests the spatial relationship, one of hovering, is preserved despite the transformed style.",
