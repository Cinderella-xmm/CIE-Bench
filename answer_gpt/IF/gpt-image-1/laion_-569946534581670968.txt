    "Question": "Q1: Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings appear as plush toys because of their uniform texture, rounded shape, and the lack of details seen in real chicken wings. The consistent golden-brown color and soft material suggest they are fabric-based replicas. The slightly crunchy texture is implied by their design, which mimics the appearance of fried chicken wings using fabric, a common trait seen in plush toys designed to resemble food items.",
