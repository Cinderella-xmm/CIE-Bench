    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser clearly appears to be a LEGO model, as evidenced by the texture and construction pattern typical of LEGO bricksâ€”the blocky structure and the interlocking stud method are apparent. The dresser heavily features brown bricks with gold elements for decoration. The visual cues indicate it is entirely constructed from LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates an intricate design pattern reminiscent of decorative furniture, using small interlocking LEGO bricks. The decorative pattern, primarily in gold, is aligned with typical LEGO construction methods, using smaller pieces to replicate a complex design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the curved sides and legs of the dresser constructed using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser's sides and legs appear rounded and smoothly joined, which suggests the use of specialized sloped LEGO bricks often employed to create smooth curves. The visual analysis shows consistency in the curved forms indicative of sloped brick construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the marble top been replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles?",
    "explanation": "The top of the dresser in Image B appears flat and gray, reflecting the characteristics of LEGO tiles. These tiles are typically flat and studless to convey a smooth surface, unlike the marble top seen in traditional furniture like Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the dresser placed on a neutral, plain background that does not distract from the LEGO structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the dresser against a simple beige background, serving as a neutral canvas that emphasizes the dresser itself without diversion. Such a plain background is ideal for focusing on the intricate LEGO construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the LEGO dresser maintain the original two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs around each drawer?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspection, Image B's LEGO dresser maintains an ornate frame design that seems to encompass the whole front surface, but there's a subtle visual departure from accommodating distinct drawer separation like in Image A. Hence, it does not clearly depict a two-drawer structure with frames around each drawer as seen in the traditional version.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all surfaces of the dresser visibly composed of LEGO bricks, with no realistic wood or metal textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B distinctly showcases surfaces entirely composed of LEGO bricks, including the characteristic studded texture and the geometric design of typical LEGO construction. There are no realistic wood or metal textures present, affirming a purely LEGO-based composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
