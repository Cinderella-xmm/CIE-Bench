    "Question": "Q2: Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks display a high-gloss, reflective finish that imparts a synthetic, 3D model-like appearance, unlike natural duck feathers that are typically matte. This visual cue, combined with the typical characteristics of manufactured models, leads to the conclusion that they have been edited to appear as 3D glossy models.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water within the glass orb shows a pronounced, clear, and shiny texture, similar to resin or polymer materials known for their clarity and depth-enhancing properties. These visual effects are often used in miniature or artistic representations to convey depth, supporting the notion that such materials are depicted here.",
