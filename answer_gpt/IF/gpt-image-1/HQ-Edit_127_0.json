      "question": "Is the title \"The Nocturnal Observer's Guide\" clearly displayed on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is styled like a scientific illustration and features an owl on a branch with labels pointing to specific parts of the owl's anatomy. The visual design suggests an informative context, however, there is no visible title displayed such as 'The Nocturnal Observer's Guide'. Without seeing explicit text that serves as a title, the correct observation relies on the clear presence of such text, which is absent in the image.",

      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding foliage display lush, highly detailed botanical features consistent with a scientific illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree branch and leaves in Image B are depicted with clear outlines and structured in a way that highlights educational labels, which is characteristic of scientific illustrations. Despite the simplicity in the representation, the intent is to inform rather than to present artistic botanical detail, as the labels suggest a focus on anatomy rather than lushness.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image dominated by earthy tones, particularly highlighting the owl’s brown and cream plumage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a sepia-toned color palette, which is common for historical or educational illustrations. This palette naturally emphasizes earthy tones, matching the brown and cream hues typical of an owl's plumage. This stylistic choice keeps the colors muted and highlights the owl's natural coloration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly includes labels directly pointing to specific parts of the owl, such as the talons and feathers, with them being explicitly named. This labeling style is indicative of an educational or scientific diagram meant to teach viewers about specific anatomical features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a diagram featuring lunar phases, which includes labels and dotted representations of different moon phases like 'Full'. This classification is a concise scientific illustration often used to educate viewers about celestial events in relation to nocturnal creatures like owls.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is a text box containing a paragraph that discusses owl nocturnal adaptations, aligning with the style of an educational guide. This descriptive passage informs viewers about specific behaviors or characteristics of owls that relate to their nighttime activity.",
