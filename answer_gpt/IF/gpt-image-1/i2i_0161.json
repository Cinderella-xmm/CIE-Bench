      "question": "Is there a large title saying “Catch the Wave” placed above the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large and bold title at the top of the image which reads 'Catch the Wave'. The horizon line, which is where the ocean meets the sky, serves as a reference point for positioning. The text is placed above this horizon line, making the statement true.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a note in the bottom-left corner that reads “Summer Adventures – 2025”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Summer Adventures – 2025' is visible directly below the 'Catch the Wave' title, and it is placed at the center rather than in the bottom-left corner of the image. Therefore, the note does not appear in the specified bottom-left position.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the title “Catch the Wave” visibly larger compared to other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Catch the Wave' is prominently displayed and is indeed larger in size than the subtitle 'Summer Adventures – 2025' which appears below it. This creates a visually dominant element compared to the other text in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the text 'Catch the Wave' situated in the upper portion of the image, and it is positioned clearly above the ocean horizon line. This indicates that the statement is true regarding the placement of the text relative to the horizon.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Summer Adventures – 2025' does indeed include the year '2025'. However, this note is not located in the bottom-left corner but is centered below the main title. Despite its placement, the content of the text does include the specified year.",
