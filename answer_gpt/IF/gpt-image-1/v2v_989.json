    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is stylized with simple lines, a rounded body, and proportionally larger head and eyes, which are characteristic of a chibi-style that often exaggerates features for a cute, endearing appearance. This stylization is indicative of the chibi art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows these objects in a simplistic and straightforward manner, without any depth, shadow, or gradient, which aligns with a minimalist flat design approach. The absence of 3D effects suggests a focus on clean lines and basic shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the black dog is depicted in a central and noticeable manner in Image B, this does not necessarily make it the most prominent element. All the elements, including the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag, are equally simplified, indicating no particular prominence given to the dog beyond its cute representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the illustration incorporate a bold white outline around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible bold white outline surrounding the entire composition, which is a common technique used in stickers or cut-out illustrations to provide separation from the background and enhance overall visibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog and bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame of the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dog and bench in a way that they blend into the circular frame but do not visibly extend beyond it. All elements remain enclosed within the defined circular boundary, maintaining the illustration's composition within the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the illustration transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the objects is not visible, which often hints that the background layer is transparent. The checkered pattern around the illustration indicates transparency, commonly used to represent transparency in digital image editing.",
