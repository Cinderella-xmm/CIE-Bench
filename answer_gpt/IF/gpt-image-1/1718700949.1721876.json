      "question": "Is the elephant depicted as a smaller-scale version enclosed within a transparent glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is shown inside a transparent glass display case. This can be deduced from the visible structure with clear walls resembling typical display cases used for models or collectibles. The proportions of the elephant relative to the size of the display case further suggest that it is a smaller-scale version rather than a life-sized animal.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor details on the elephant appear to have a shiny and polished finish, reminiscent of a metallic or resin-like texture.
