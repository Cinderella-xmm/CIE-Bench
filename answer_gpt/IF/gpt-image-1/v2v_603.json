      "question": "Have the skiers been converted into 3D chibi-style characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skiers appear as 3D characters with exaggerated proportions typical of chibi style, such as larger heads and eyes in relation to their bodies. This style simplification and distortion of human features is a hallmark of chibi art, indicating that the skiers have been converted into this style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skiers are depicted in the same color attire (one in red and the other in blue) with similar backpacks and ski gear as seen in Image A.

      "question": "Has the snowy forest setting been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background still depicts a snowy forest with trees covered in snow, suggesting the same setting as Image A. The foggy atmosphere that pervades both images maintains the look of a snowy forest environment.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images exhibit similar compositions with the skiers positioned similarly relative to each other and to the snow-covered pine trees lining a path. This indicates that the arrangement and positions have been preserved from Image A to Image B.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B have the characteristic chibi style typically seen in animations, such as a larger head-to-body ratio, larger eyes, and simplified facial features. These are clear visual indicators of exaggerated proportions and simplified features common in chibi art.",
