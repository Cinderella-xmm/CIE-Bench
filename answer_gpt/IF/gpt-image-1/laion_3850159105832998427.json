      "question": "Has the body of the guitar been transformed into a dragon's torso with organic, beast-like features such as scales or musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar's body is prominently integrated into the design of a dragon. The central portion that originally would be the guitar's body is now part of a dragon's overall form, showcasing features typical of reptiles like scales and a muscular structure. The dragon's anatomy envelops the guitar seamlessly, showing organic lines and textures. Thus, the guitar body has indeed been transformed into a dragon's torso.",

      "question": "Has the guitar neck been reshaped into an elongated, elegant dragon neck that extends naturally from the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the guitar neck as being part of the dragon's neck, which elegantly stretches from the torso, maintaining the length and alignment one might expect from both elements combined. This neck subtly merges the features of both a guitar and a dragon, making it look natural and fluid in connection with the dragon's body.",

      "question": "Have the original tuning pegs been replaced with golden, horn-like spikes on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the headstock does not feature golden, horn-like spikes replacing tuning pegs. Instead, the dragon's horns themselves are visible above the guitar headstock, but they do not specifically modify the guitar's pegs. Consequently, the answer hinges on the absence of such replacements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck area of the guitar integrated with the dragon's features has visible luminescent runes. These glowing symbols resemble magical runes and run along the neck, emulating the placement and continuity one might expect of inlays on a fretboard, enhancing the mystical aura of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the guitar strings as being transformed into fiery, flame-like tendrils. This change enhances the creative and fantastical theme of the image, depicting the strings not as traditional metallic strands but as energetic, vibrant flames completing the visual transition from the guitar's strings.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cutaway horns typically found on such a guitar model stylize into majestic dragon wings. These wings exhibit intricate, scale-like patterns, reinforcing the organic and mythical transformation of the guitar into a dragon-like creature. The scale details match typical dragon wing depictions found in fantasy art.",
