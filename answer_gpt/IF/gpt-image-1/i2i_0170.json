    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the overall lines and contours of the image now clear and well-defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall lines and contours are depicted in a stylized manner typical of digital illustrations. The forms are smooth and streamlined, approximating the stylized appearance of illustrations, leading to well-defined contours across the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the original textures been replaced with soft gradient blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses flat colors with some gradients rather than intricate textures. This is a characteristic of artistic illustrations designed to simplify real-world textures into more graphical forms, resulting in the replacement of original textures with color gradient blocks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image now exhibit characteristics of a high-end commercial illustration (e.g., refined and sophisticated appearance)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized aesthetic of Image B aligns with characteristics of high-end commercial illustrations. It is refined, uses a sophisticated color palette, and communicates a polished appearance typical of commercial artwork used in advertising and editorial layouts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges and boundaries between elements in the image now sharply defined and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between elements, such as the figures and background, is distinct and clean. This is achieved through the use of solid lines and clear divisions inherent to vector-like illustrations, resulting in sharp definition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do areas previously filled with detailed textures now feature smooth, soft gradients instead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transition to Image B, areas that may have had detailed textures in a photographic sense are replaced with smooth, soft gradients typical of digital art. This fits the illustration style that streamlines complexity into gradient tones.",
