      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire includes a dark suit jacket, a red formal shirt, and a striped tie, typical of an adult's formal wear. Since the context suggests that the infant is intended to mirror an adult's formal wear, it can be inferred that the infant in the analogous themed comparison, Image A, would also be wearing a formal shirt mirroring the adult's attire.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outfit features a striped tie, part of a conventional formal ensemble. By analyzing the theme of the images, where the infant mimics the adult's formal attire, it would be consistent for the infant in Image A to be dressed similarly, including wearing a tie.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire includes formal suit trousers, part of a typical formal suit ensemble. Given the theme of mirroring adult formal attire seen in the comparison between the two images, it's logical to conclude that the infant's apparel in Image A would feature a similar level of formality, including formal trousers.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual is holding glasses as a part of the formal attire. Considering the theme of matching the adult's formal look, it's reasonable to deduce that the infant in Image A would be holding glasses as an accessory to complete the formal look.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the formal suit, shirt, tie, and accessory (glasses) form a cohesive formal appearance typical of adult business or formal wear. By examining the theme and notation of matching the adult's attire, the infant's outfit in Image A is expected to maintain a similar cohesive formal appearance, even though the context is playful due to the infant's portrayal.",
