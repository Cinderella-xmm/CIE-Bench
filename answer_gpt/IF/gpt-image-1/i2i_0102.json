        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is visible on the yellow paper.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the word 'Draft' appears clearly and prominently on the yellow paper. The positioning suggests intentional placement for emphasis, emphasizing the paper’s role as the focal point of the image, typical in designs where particular text needs highlighting or association with specific materials. This matches standard design practices.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays components typical of a design sketch cover: clear typography indicating 'Draft,' a colored background (yellow paper), and relevant supporting elements (pencil and part of a laptop blurred for context). The arrangement mimics covers or headers that introduce sketches or design themes, prominently displaying the word 'Draft' as the centerpiece.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Draft' in Image B is large, with each letter distinctly shaped, allowing straightforward readability. The font size, style, and color contrast with the yellow background provide clarity and legibility, necessary attributes in design communication for effective viewer comprehension.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, besides the yellow paper and 'Draft' text, there are additional elements such as the blue pencil and blurred features of a laptop in the background. Together, these details form a context-rich scene, setting the environment typical for design or sketch-related activities.",
