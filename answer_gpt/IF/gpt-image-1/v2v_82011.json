      "question": "Do the dolls have bold calligraphic outlines around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are depicted with bold outlines typical of calligraphic styles, which are used in illustrations to make elements stand out more prominently. This style is different from the photographic representation in Image A, where there are no such strong, bold outlines around the dolls.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dolls' clothing and hair depicted using flat planes of color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows dolls with clothing and hair simplified into flat colors, which is a stylistic choice often used in illustrations and cartoons to simplify and stylize the visual elements. Image A had more realistic textures and gradients in the clothing and hair, indicative of a photograph. The flat planes of color in Image B indicate a departure from realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the store environment been replaced with a subtly patterned, simplified background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the dolls is replaced with a simple patterned design consisting of clouds, which simplifies the environment compared to the original store setting depicted in Image A. This change transforms the setting into something more abstract, departing from the rich detail of a store environment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the doll in the foreground still striking a ballet pose with a light-colored tutu?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doll's pose is similar to the ballet pose seen in Image A, with its arms raised and a similarly styled skirt, resembling a tutu. The design of the clothing remains consistent with the tutu aspect, even though it is rendered in a more stylized manner.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the seated doll with a consistent pose and positioning as in Image A, wearing a pink top while seated on a fuchsia-colored surface. The rendering style differs, but the compositional elements remain unchanged regarding the doll's positioning and clothing color.",
