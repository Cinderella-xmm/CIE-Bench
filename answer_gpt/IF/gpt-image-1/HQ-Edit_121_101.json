      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presentation consists of four separate elements that resemble stamps, each with perforated edges typical of stamp designs.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the hanbok appear in a flat, uniform color without any indications of metallic foil effects, such as shiny or reflective highlights. This style aligns with the flat, illustrative design commonly seen in paper-cut or printed images.",

The texture and depth create the appearance of a tactile, leather-like surface, which supports the description of the stamps being displayed on such a surface.",
