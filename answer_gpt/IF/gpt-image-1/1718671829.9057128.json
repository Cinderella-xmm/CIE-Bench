      "question": "Are the structural lines of the cabin composed entirely of geometric shapes with no organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structural lines of the cabin are depicted using bold, straight lines and angular forms, consistent with geometric shapes. The roof, frame, and other elements all maintain a rectilinear appearance, without any organic curvature. These characteristics align with typical geometric design principles where emphasis is placed on straight lines and angles over natural, curved forms.",

      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a glowing, radiant circle with visible light rays or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is illustrated as a solid, flat circle without any additional effects such as light rays or halos, emphasizing its geometric nature. When considering the defining visual language of the Art Deco style employed, such emphasis on simple shapes and outlines without naturalistic light effects is typical. Thus, based on these characteristics, the moon in Image B does not exhibit glowing or radiant effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the plants rendered in symmetrical, patterned arrangements instead of natural growth forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants are shown in a stylized, symmetrical pattern rather than resembling any organic, irregular growth. The leaves and flowers are evenly spaced with consistent shapes, adhering to patterns rather than random natural forms. This kind of depiction reflects a design focused on symmetry and uniformity, which contrasts the more irregular and varied forms seen in natural plant growth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are metallic textures and colors (gold and silver) visibly applied to key elements such as the cabin frame, windows, or decorative motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the predominant use of gold tones across the cabin structure, windows, and elements is evident, creating a visual effect reminiscent of metallic textures. This use of gold color captures the luxurious, high-contrast feel typically associated with metallic surfaces, although there is no direct textural detail indicating metal. The consistent application of this color across large parts of the image creates an impression of a metallic motif.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there abstract, geometrically shaped clouds present in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features clouds that are stylized into smooth, geometric shapes rather than the fluffy and irregular forms typical of actual clouds. This stylization involves simple curves and straight lines to form the clouds, fitting the aesthetics of geometric abstraction. Such interpretations lean heavily on angular and ordered depictions rather than attempts to replicate the organic complexity seen in nature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the windows display bold, dynamic features such as thick frames, angular divisions, or radiating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows are depicted with bold, straight lines and angular designs, contributing to a dynamic and stylistically cohesive appearance. The use of thick frames aligns with these design elements, capturing an angular and robust architectural motif which likely reflects a decorative, rather than functional, purpose typical in such artistic styles.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a flat, graphic quality with strong symmetry, angular lines, and decorative elements characteristic of Art Deco posters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly exhibits a flat, graphic aesthetics consistent with Art Deco, utilizing strong symmetry, angular lines, and decorative elements extensively. This flat quality is achieved through uniform color application and limited use of gradients, while the structured composition with repeated patterns and shapes aligns well with Art Decoâ€™s iconic stylistic identity.",
