        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is dressed in a tailored suit, featuring a high collar with a cravat, which is characteristic of 19th-century British fashion.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A exhibits a traditional Indian turban, rich in color and adorned with typical embellishments. In Image B, this headwear has been altered to resemble a tall, formal top hat common in the 19th-century British fashion, complete with a feather. This transformation is a direct shift from cultural headwear to a Western style, signifying the hat is indeed replaced.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a landscape that includes a manor house or estate grounds, reminiscent of the 19th-century British countryside imagery.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background exhibits an oil painting style, characterized by visible brushwork and a palette of rich, muted tones. These artistic features are typical of classic oil paintings, providing a textured and historical aesthetic.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

Excluding facial features, other physical stances remain similar, emphasizing consistency in the pose between both images.",
