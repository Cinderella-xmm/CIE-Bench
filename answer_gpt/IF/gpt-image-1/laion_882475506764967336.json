      "question": "Are the table and chairs visibly constructed from LEGO bricks with interlocking patterns and stud details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows objects that are clearly modeled using LEGO bricks, which are characterized by their uniform shape and distinctive interlocking design with visible studs. These studs are part of the standard LEGO system and facilitate the connection between bricks. The chairs and table display this construction, evident through the consistent use of rectangular shapes and visible small circular studs typical of LEGO pieces.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tabletop and chairs in Image B show a distinct modular construction characteristic of LEGO pieces. The flat surfaces are created using interconnected rectangular LEGO bricks, evident by the separation lines and interlocking pattern, which are essential in maintaining the structure and modularity of LEGO constructions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small, green LEGO element resembling a plant is placed in the center of the table. This piece is constructed from standard LEGO components, identifiable by its blocky shape and visible studs, which are used to hold other LEGO pieces or represent decorative items in LEGO sets.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B features the furniture set on a gray LEGO baseplate that mimics the concrete patio from Image A. The baseplate displays visible studs typical of LEGO construction and serves as a familiar foundation in LEGO models, contrasting with the smooth, untextured appearance of concrete.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a simplified environment with a focus solely on the furniture and baseplate. The background elements present in Image A, such as the wooden fence, plants, and other outdoor decor, are absent, resulting in an uncluttered and minimalistic setting typical of LEGO playsets which often spotlight the main subject without excessive detail.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the LEGO bricks used for the furniture are composed only of brown shades, resembling the wooden color scheme of the original furniture in Image A. This consistent coloring maintains the intended aesthetic while exclusively using shades of brown in the construction.",
