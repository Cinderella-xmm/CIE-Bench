      "question": "Are the mountains visibly reimagined as a stone-carved body with moss forming distinct fur-like patterns across their surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original mountain appears to have been transformed into a large figure resembling a stone-carved body, with moss or a similar material forming fur-like patterns on the surface. This interpretation stems from recognizing the shape and texture typical of a carving and the presence of green textures that resemble moss or fur. The change is evident due to the distinct anthropomorphic features given to the mountain.",

      "question": "Does the lake appear as a reflective surface mirroring the sky, with visible mystical symbols embedded within its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chest area of the figure has a dark, starry appearance with mystical symbols and constellations, but it’s not a lake. The lake in Image A has been replaced or reimagined as part of the stone figure's body, specifically the chest where the symbols are embedded, giving it a magical quality. These symbols create an impression of a cosmic or mystical theme rather than a traditional lake appearance.",

      "question": "Are twisted rock horns visibly present atop the mountain peaks, distinct from the original rock formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts twisted rock formations resembling horns on top of the stone-carved figure, which were not part of the original formations in Image A. These horns are distinct and give the figure a mythical or fantastical appearance, reflecting intentional artistic modification from the original mountain peak shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the original pathways appear as glowing, luminescent lines running across the terrain, resembling veins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, luminescent lines are visible, resembling veins running across the stone-like surface of the figure’s body. These lines differ from the original pathways in Image A, which were simple trails on the terrain. The transformation into glowing lines enhances the mystical appearance of the figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grassy slopes replaced with textured, shimmering scales that exhibit a celestial or iridescent hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the stone figure does not possess shimmering scales with a celestial or iridescent hue. Instead, the surface seems rock-like with integrated luminous lines but lacks the appearance of scales. The transformation focuses on creating a stone-carved aesthetic with mystical lines rather than scaly textures.",
