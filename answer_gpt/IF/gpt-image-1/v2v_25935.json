      "question": "Is the entire urban street scene recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly features elements consistent with Lego materials. The cobblestones, buildings, and the person are all constructed with the signature Lego brick aesthetic, evident from the uniform, modular shapes and vibrant colors typical of Lego constructions. Hence, the urban street scene appears to be entirely recreated using Lego bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cobblestones on the path represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path consists of evenly shaped and spaced circular studs, typical of the tops of Lego bricks. Their arrangement is reminiscent of cobblestones and thus suggests they are represented using Lego bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the buildings in the background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings in Image B exhibit the characteristic blocky structure and studded surfaces indicative of Lego bricks. Their appearance aligns with the modular nature of Lego constructions, indicating that the buildings in the background are indeed made from Lego bricks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted as a typical Lego figurine, with a yellow head, a blue jacket, black pants, and a brown bag, all molded from and characteristic of Lego figurine elements. His cap is also a simple, solid shape common with Lego attire. Thus, the man and his accessories in the edited image are represented using Lego bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing the two images, both maintain a similar composition and perspective, showcasing a rear view of a figure walking down an alley with buildings on either side. The camera angle, distance from the subject, and alignment of architectural elements are consistent between Image A and Image B, despite the transformation into a Lego theme.",
