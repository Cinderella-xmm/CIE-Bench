        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image clearly presents a cartoonish style with exaggerated proportions and simplified forms evident in the overall layout.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the church with bold outlines and simplified shapes. The architectural details such as windows and the structure itself are minimalistic and exaggerated, typical of a cartoon style. This differs vastly from Image A, where the church is depicted with more realistic proportions and finer architectural detailing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows, including those resembling stained-glass designs, are stylized with bright and simple geometric patterns. These patterns differ from realistic stained-glass, which would typically have intricate and complex designs, as observed in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the previous pine trees seen in Image A have been replaced by candy-like objects such as lollipop sticks and striped candy canes. The shapes and colors strongly suggest confectionery design, and there are no realistic tree forms present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a sky composed of swirling pastel colors in a quilt-like pattern, contrasted with the more natural twilight sky displayed in Image A. The fantastical and vibrant style in Image B denotes an artistic aesthetic divergent from realistic depictions of the sky.",
