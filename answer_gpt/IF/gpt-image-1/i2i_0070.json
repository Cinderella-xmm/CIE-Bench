      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of tall, sparse grass and acacia-like trees, which are common features of an African savanna. The open, flat landscape also contributes to this impression, fitting the typical characteristics of a savanna. Thus, the combination of these visual elements and general world knowledge about African landscapes leads to the conclusion that the scene depicts a savanna.",

      "question": "Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is dark and filled with stars, suggesting a lack of sunlight, which is typical of nighttime settings. The overall lighting on the train and landscape is also subdued, reinforcing the nighttime atmosphere. These visual cues combined with the common association of a starry sky with nighttime lead to the conclusion that the image depicts a night-time setting.",

      "question": "Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky features a bright, banded formation running across it, which resembles the appearance of the Milky Way as seen in many night-sky photographs. This pattern is distinctive and is often highlighted in astrophotography to denote the Milky Way. Therefore, based on the visual cues and general knowledge of celestial objects, it can be concluded that the Milky Way is clearly visible in the image.",

      "question": "Are multiple stars visible alongside the Milky Way in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Alongside the brighter band of the Milky Way in Image B, numerous smaller, pinpoint lights are scattered throughout the sky. These lights resemble stars, which are a common sight in clear night skies. The distribution and appearance of these lights suggest the presence of multiple stars alongside the Milky Way. Therefore, the visual cues and knowledge about typical night skies indicate that multiple stars alongside the Milky Way are indeed visible.",

      "question": "Do the train and railway tracks appear seamlessly integrated into the savanna background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and railway tracks are placed on the ground similar to Image A, but the surroundings have been altered to a savanna landscape. The transition from the railway tracks to the savanna grass and tree setting appears smooth, with no noticeable disparities or imperfections in the editing. The perspective and depth of field are consistent, making the elements appear naturally integrated. Therefore, based on these visual cues and an understanding of image composition, the train and tracks seem to be seamlessly integrated into the savanna background.",
