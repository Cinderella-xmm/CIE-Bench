      "question": "Has the dog been converted into a chibi-style blind box figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the dog appears in a stylized, cartoonish format characterized by exaggerated features like a large head, big eyes, and simplified textures—distinct features of chibi-style figures. This is consistent with the design of a blind box figure which emphasizes cuteness. Thus, Image B represents a conversion into a chibi-style figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog’s body still in the prone, ball-focused pose after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure depicts a dog positioned closely to a ball with its body in a direct, forward-facing posture that mimics a prone approach, albeit with stylized proportions. The body posture indicates a focus on the ball, consistent with having a ball-focused stance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the dog's head been enlarged slightly compared to its original size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the dog's head is considerably larger relative to its body in comparison to realistic proportions. Chibi-style figures typically have enlarged heads to emphasize cuteness, and the head in Image B follows this stylistic approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball placed so that it touches the dog's nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tennis ball positioned directly against the dog's nose, appearing to make contact. The placement is such that the ball is adjacent to and touching the nose of the chibi-style dog figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Does the base feature a relief tennis ball pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the base in Image B, there is a visible pattern featuring relief-like tennis ball designs around its perimeter. This visual detail on the base signifies a tennis ball motif, enhancing the thematic connection to the figure itself.",
