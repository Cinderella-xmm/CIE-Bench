      "question": "Is the background replaced with snow and icebergs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of snow and icebergs, which are typical features of a polar or Arctic environment. This is in contrast to Image A, which features a background of earth and greenery. Observing the distinct features associated with cold climates in Image B, it's evident that the background has been replaced.",

      "question": "Are the carrots still rooted in soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are shown emerging from dark brown soil, similar to typical planting scenarios, even though they are surrounded by snow and ice in the background. Based on visual cues, the carrots in Image B retain this fundamental characteristic of being rooted in soil.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the carrots retain their original appearance in terms of color and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots maintain their bright orange color and rounded shape with green leaves on top, just as they appear in Image A. The form and color of the carrots remain unchanged between the two images, indicating that they have retained their original appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image show a clear contrast between the Arctic background and the soil around the carrots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a strong visual contrast between the stark white and blue shades of the snowy and icy background typical of an Arctic setting and the rich, dark brown soil in which the carrots are planted. This contrast is clear and significant, highlighting the unusual juxtaposition of the elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall setting of the image consistent with an Arctic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of snow and icebergs strongly suggests an Arctic environment. The primary elements of an Arctic setting, such as significant ice formations and a snowy landscape, are evident. Despite the presence of soil and carrots, which are not typical of Arctic conditions, the overall visual cues, primarily the snow and ice, make the setting appear consistent with an Arctic environment.",
