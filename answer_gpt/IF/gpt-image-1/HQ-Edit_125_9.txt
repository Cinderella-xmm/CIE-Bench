    "Question": "Q4: Are the headlines '1962 Champions' and 'Inside: The Game Changers' present at the top of the image in readable text?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains legible headlines at the top reading 'Inside: The Game Changers.' There is no headline mentioning '1962 Champions.'

    "Question": "Q5: Have the houses and trees in the background been reduced to simple, dark silhouettes without detailed features?",

    "Question": "Q7: Are all textual elements (headlines and main title) rendered in a bold serif font style?",
    "explanation": "Image B combines font styles: the main title ‘FOOTY LEGENDS’ appears in a bold serif font, while the headline at the top 'Inside: The Game Changers' seems to be rendered in a sans-serif font. Thus, not all text elements use the same bold serif style.",
    "answer": "No"
