      "question": "Are the bookshelf and books fully constructed from LEGO bricks instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf and the books have a distinct appearance reminiscent of LEGO bricks. The structured appearance, uniformity, and the geometric designs they demonstrate align with LEGO construction rather than typical wooden textures. Given these visual cues, and combining this with knowledge about LEGO's design characteristics like its distinct block-like construction, leads to the conclusion that both are made from LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all books represented as individual LEGO blocks in earthy tones (e.g., brown, tan, terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the books are all presented in uniform tones that are earthy, including shades like brown, tan, and terracotta. These tones are consistent and distinct from typical book materials, suggesting they are individual LEGO blocks. The consistency in color and shape aligns with the appearance of Lego bricks.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the intricate carvings on the original shelf and book spines replicated using darker LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the intricate carvings appears to be present mimicking the original wooden design but formed by using darker hues of LEGO bricks. This suggests an attempt to replicate the intricate carvings by creating patterns through the arrangement of differently colored bricks, specifically darker bricks are used to replicate depth and shadow, characteristic of real carvings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the LEGO tower narrow progressively toward the top, forming a tapered shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the LEGO bookshelf does not exhibit any narrowing as it ascends towards the top. Instead, it shows a consistent width from bottom to top, maintaining its rectangular form typical of a LEGO construction without any tapering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO structure smooth and plastic-like, lacking any wood grain or natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the LEGO bookshelf in Image B showcases the typical smooth and uniform texture signature to plastic LEGO bricks, without any depiction of wood grain or natural texture that would be characteristic of real wood. The glossiness and uniformity confirm that it is indeed plastic-like.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background plain and muted, without any patterns or textures, to highlight the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with a solid, neutral color that does not display any patterns or textures. This plain backdrop serves to accentuate the LEGO structure by providing a contrast that highlights the distinct form and features of the bookshelf.",
