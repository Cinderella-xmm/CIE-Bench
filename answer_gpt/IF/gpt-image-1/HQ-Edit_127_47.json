      "question": "Is the entire forest lake scene enclosed within a visible spherical glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest lake scene is clearly surrounded by a spherical glass structure, which is visually identifiable by its curved shape and the characteristic reflections and distortions typical of glass. The scene within maintains consistency with the idea of being encapsulated, suggesting it is within a glass orb.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks display a high-gloss, reflective finish that imparts a synthetic, 3D model-like appearance, unlike natural duck feathers that are typically matte. This visual cue, combined with the typical characteristics of manufactured models, leads to the conclusion that they have been edited to appear as 3D glossy models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water within the glass orb shows a pronounced, clear, and shiny texture, similar to resin or polymer materials known for their clarity and depth-enhancing properties. These visual effects are often used in miniature or artistic representations to convey depth, supporting the notion that such materials are depicted here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible miniature figurines of woodland animals placed among the rocks and vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays small figurines of woodland animals, such as squirrels, positioned among the rocks and greenery. These elements are notably different from naturally present animals, appearing crafted and miniature due to their stylized form and placement, indicating they are indeed figurines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass orb resting on a natural wood base with visible organic textures such as grain or bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the glass orb has visible wood grain patterns, suggesting it is made of natural wood. These are detailed textures commonly associated with wooden materials, distinct from synthetic bases, affirming that the orb rests on a wooden base.",
