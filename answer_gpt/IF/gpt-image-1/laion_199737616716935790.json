      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the motorcycle composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the motorcycle appears to be constructed using LEGO-style bricks with a predominant black and blue color scheme. There are no other prominent colors used in the brick construction of the motorcycle, confirming that it is composed of black and blue bricks. The visual cues are reinforced by the fact that LEGO models typically use a limited color palette for consistency and thematic coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the angular design features of the original motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the LEGO model of the motorcycle maintains sharp, angular lines similar to the original design. The use of LEGO bricks, which are inherently angular, supports the replication of angular features. This is evidenced by the pointed decals and overall shape that echo the style of the original motorcycle.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wheel rims replaced with intricate cog patterns typical of LEGO mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheel rims of the LEGO model have patterns that resemble intricate cog designs, which are characteristic of LEGO sets that include mechanical themes or technical sets. These patterns differ from regular smooth wheel rims and suggest a more detailed, gear-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original decals represented as colorful printed tiles on the LEGO model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the decals from the original motorcycle design are translated onto the LEGO model using printed tiles. This method is common in LEGO models to represent details and decals without paint, maintaining consistency with how the original colorful decals are applied.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model placed on a smooth gray baseplate with directional arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model is indeed displayed on a gray baseplate, which is smooth, and includes directional arrow decals. This setup provides showcase elements typical of detailed LEGO installations, where the baseplate is used to enhance presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the blue and black stripes follow the same dynamic flow and positioning as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reflects a similar layout and flow of blue and black stripes on the LEGO model as in Image A. The positioning on the body parts of the motorcycle is analogous, suggesting that the design intends to mimic the original styling closely using bricks and printed tiles to maintain the dynamic look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model displayed within a clean, enclosed display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the LEGO model is housed within an enclosed, transparent display case. Display cases of this nature are used for protecting and showcasing models, ensuring that the model has a clean presentation while preventing dust and damage.",
