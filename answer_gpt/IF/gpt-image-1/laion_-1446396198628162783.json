      "question": "Is the title \"Journey to Space\" clearly displayed in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no visible title 'Journey to Space' at any point in the infographic. The design focuses on the astronaut and various training stages rather than having a title. This conclusion was made by noting the absence of large, distinct text that could serve as a title.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut figure is indeed central to the design, as it is the main focal point around which the additional information and graphical elements are arranged. This was identified by observing the placement of the astronaut figure in relation to the layout of the text and icons.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background features visual elements that resemble a mission control center. These elements include control screens and panels, reinforcing the context of space training and missions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains four distinct illustrative icons, each denoting one of the training aspects listed: Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, and Space Suit Check. This is discerned by the presence of icons with accompanying descriptions matching these themes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The four training stages in Image B are indeed depicted with distinct and vibrant color-coded labels, aiding in differentiating each section visually. This conclusion comes from the observation of varied background colors and label styles.",
