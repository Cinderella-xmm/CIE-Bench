      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress has a uniform golden-brown color with slightly darker edges, resembling the appearance of baked good edges. The color and texture, combined with the block-like structure, are indicative of cookie dough. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues that mimic common characteristics of baked cookies, such as golden-brown hues and darker, crispy-looking edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls and towers of the fortress in Image B indeed display a golden-brown base color with slightly darker edges. These darker edges are characteristic of the way baked goods, particularly cookies, appear after being in the oven, where the edges tend to brown more than the center.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterfalls in Image B are represented as smooth and glossy white streams, closely resembling royal icing often used in decorating cookies and cakes. This is different from the irregular flow and texture of natural water, suggesting that this was an intentional choice to mimic piping icing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees in the image made from smooth, uniformly green-colored marzipan with no realistic leaf detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are shown as smooth, uniformly green spheres without any leaf patterns or textures, similar to how marzipan or fondant is shaped and colored when used as decoration. This lack of detail in foliage combined with the spherical shape is indicative of a modeling material rather than real foliage.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cookie castle placed on a large, flat, white ceramic platter that is clearly visible beneath and around the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene, including the cookie castle, is situated on a large, flat surface that appears to be a white ceramic platter. The edges of this platter are visible around the structure, supporting the conclusion that the scene is set on a platter typically used for serving or displaying large decorative food items.",
