      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings appear as plush toys because of their uniform texture, rounded shape, and the lack of details seen in real chicken wings. The consistent golden-brown color and soft material suggest they are fabric-based replicas. The slightly crunchy texture is implied by their design, which mimics the appearance of fried chicken wings using fabric, a common trait seen in plush toys designed to resemble food items.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sauce replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the sauce is transformed into an object resembling a pillow. The object has a soft, round shape and textured surface indicative of a pillow design, which means it's intended to mimic the sauce visually. The bright orange color aligns with the sauce presentation in food replicas and pillows designed to represent food elements.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene set on a smooth, light-colored wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background consists of a uniform smooth surface with wood grain patterns, characteristic of light-colored wooden tables. This setting contrasts with the more varied table textures seen in food settings to enhance the realistic presentation of the plated items. The overall light and neutral tone reinforce the wooden surface's appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the plush wings and the orange pillow arranged in the same spatial configuration as the original chicken wings and sauce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the plush wings and orange pillow in Image B appear to have a layout similar to Image A, maintaining the spatial arrangement of wings surrounding a central sauce container. This consistency in arrangement signifies intentional mimicking of the original setup using fabric objects to reflect the same meal presentation pattern.",
