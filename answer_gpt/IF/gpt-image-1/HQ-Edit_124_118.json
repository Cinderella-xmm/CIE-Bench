      "question": "Does the scene appear as a digitally rendered holographic installation with visible projection-like effects such as transparency, layering, or digital glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show neon-like glowing elements and transparent surfaces reminiscent of digital projections. These are common effects used in digitally rendered holograms and installations to create a futuristic and ethereal atmosphere. Combining these observations with world knowledge of digital art and installations, it's reasonable to conclude that the scene is meant to be perceived as a holographic installation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as animated light projections on transparent or reflective glass surfaces instead of natural flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls appear to be immersed in glowing light and positioned alongside glass-like structures, suggesting they are not traditional waterfalls. The visible digital glow and positioning on these surfaces indicate they are intended to be projections rather than real water. By combining visual information with knowledge of digital art, the waterfalls can be seen as animated light projections.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees feature visible iridescent, glowing filaments resembling fiber optics embedded within their trunks and branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B display glowing, rainbow-like filaments within their structure. These resemble fiber optics, which are often used in digital and light installations to create a luminous effect. The branches and trunks appear to radiate light similar to how fiber optics would in a controlled environment, indicating that they are intentionally designed as such rather than natural wooden elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines appear as virtualized, looping structures with light trails or animated effects, forming a kinetic light sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines in Image B have a distinct looping appearance with clearly visible trails of light circulating them. This gives an impression of movement or animation typical of virtualized structures and kinetic sculptures designed in digital installations. The animated effects contribute to the sculpture-like ambiance, pointing to the vines being depicted as part of a light installation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the environment integrated with futuristic architectural elements such as glass panels, geometric structures, or artificial lighting that blend with the natural forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features geometric glass panels and projections, which are indicative of futuristic architecture. These elements are smoothly integrated with the natural forms of trees and waterfalls, creating a harmonious blend typical of installations that bring together nature and advanced architectural designs. Combining this visual evidence with world knowledge of modern art installations suggests a deliberate integration of futuristic architectural elements.",
