      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character Pikachu is depicted fully, including its head, body, arms, legs, and tail. A half-body form typically refers to a depiction from the waist up or in partial form. Considering the visual cues and common understanding of what constitutes a full-body depiction, Pikachu is shown entirely. Therefore, the character is not in a half-body form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows Pikachu appearing to emerge from a device resembling a tablet. Pikachu is above the screen, giving the impression of jumping out or interacting with the tablet, which is common in animated or interactive depictions. Given the movement suggested by Pikachu's posture and position relative to the tablet, it gives the impression of 'jumping out.' Combining this visual depiction with common interactive design, the effect simulates a jump.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu's arms are extended and raised, a gesture typically interpreted as open and welcoming in character animations.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays Pikachu interacting with a device resembling a tablet, emerging from the screen. This visual treatment and concept align with interactive entertainment, where characters appear to break the boundary of the digital screen, creating engagement and immersion.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tablet has rounded edges, which are commonly seen in tablets aimed at children for safety and ergonomic reasons. The screen background features bright, vibrant blue colors, which are often used in designing children's gadgets and toys to appeal visually.
