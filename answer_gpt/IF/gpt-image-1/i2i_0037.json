      "question": "Does the image have a white border frame surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows a clear white border surrounding it, reminiscent of the style used in Polaroid photographs. This visual cue is indicative of having a frame, which when combined with common knowledge of Polaroid-style pictures, confirms that the image indeed has a white border frame.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a caption located at the bottom of the image. Upon analysis, the caption reads 'Banana Cream Dream' without any additional date like '2024'. This observation is based on visual information from Image B.",

      "question": "Does the image exhibit a light brown vintage filter that gives the appearance of a film-style photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors appear muted and exhibit a brownish hue that reduces the vibrancy found in usual photographs, suggesting a vintage filter. This vintage appearance is common in images designed to mimic old film photographs, characterized by their warm tones.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines both the visual cues of a white border frame and a vintage filter, both characteristic features of Polaroid-style presentations. Visualizing the combination of these elements gives the appearance synonymous with traditional Polaroid photos.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comparison of Image A and Image B reveals that the dessert itself, including the whipped cream and banana slices, has not undergone any modifications or additions. The changes applied are solely aesthetic, including the frame, caption, and vintage filter. Therefore, the dessert's original appearance has been preserved.",
