    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the head been slightly enlarged compared to the original body proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a noticeable difference in proportion between the head size and the rest of the body; the head looks larger relative to the body than it usually would in real life. This gives the impression of cartoonification or caricature, where features are exaggerated for effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the body been cartoonified with flattened colors and simple shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body in the edited image appears to have simplified shapes, such as a blocky and rounded structure typical of cartoon styles, along with flat colors lacking intricate details or textures, making the body cartoonified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the edited subject placed against a background resembling a bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image includes vertical elements resembling books, which align with a visual representation of a bookshelf. This scene is consistent with common bookshelf design, with rows of books placed vertically.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the eyes, smile, and proportions accurately maintained after enlarging the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without needing facial features analysis since the face is blurred, it's essential to maintain logical coherence. Typically, in an enlargement for a cartoonified style, the facial proportions are characteristically altered, and the blurring avoids facial details. There might be inaccuracies if details were visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cartoonified body appear separate from and non-intrusive to the realistic face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the blur on the face, the cartoonified body, distinct with simplified and stylized shapes, appears separate and is non-intrusive, suggesting that they are two distinct stylistic elements in a single composition.",
