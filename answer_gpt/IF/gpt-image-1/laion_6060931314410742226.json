      "question": "Is the rose bush rendered as a mosaic mural composed of distinct tile-like segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose bush is composed of many small interconnected shapes resembling mosaic tiles. This style gives the impression of a mosaic wall mural, which is characterized by distinct segments forming a comprehensive image. The tile-like segments are visible across the entire image, clearly indicating a mosaic rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all flowers outlined with bold, distinct borders resembling ceramic tile edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B have bold outlines that define the edges of the petals, similar to how ceramic tiles have distinct edges. This stylistic choice reinforces the mosaic theme of the image, where each segment of the design is clearly delineated.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petals and leaves depicted in shades of pearl (soft white/off-white) and jade (greenish tones), replacing their original colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows petals with shades that resemble pearl, which is a soft white or off-white tone, while the leaves are depicted with greenish tones, similar to jade. This indicates a shift from potentially more vibrant or varied colors in Image A to more muted, consistent hues in Image B, consistent with the mosaic aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the red brick building been abstracted using terracotta tile shades (warm earthy tones) instead of realistic red bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's bricks are not the bright red typical of real bricks, but are rendered in warm earthy tones, reminiscent of terracotta tiles. This alteration fits the mosaic style, which often uses earthy hues to create artistic representations rather than literal ones.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are architectural features of the building (such as arches or window frames) incorporated into the mosaic pattern as stylized elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The architectural features in Image B, like the arches and window frames, are integrated into the mosaic pattern, depicted in a stylized manner that maintains their structure but alters their representation to fit the artistic mosaic theme. This portrayal is typical in mosaics where elements are simplified and stylized for aesthetic effect.",
