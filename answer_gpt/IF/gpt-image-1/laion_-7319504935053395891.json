      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has a triangular shape with tiered layers, reminiscent of a Christmas tree, suggesting a box-like structure. This design mimics a festive tree rather than a multi-tiered tower as seen in traditional chocolate displays or previous designs.",
