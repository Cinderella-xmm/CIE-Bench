      "question": "Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the teapot appears to be made of transparent material which is characteristic of clear glass. The visual cues indicate a clear surface, typical of glass, without any visible opaque or solid material blocking the view through the teapot. World knowledge tells us that glass is commonly used for elegant and decorative teapot designs. Thus, I conclude that the main body is indeed made of clear glass.",

      "question": "Is the body of the teapot transparent, allowing visibility through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the teapot is visibly transparent, allowing the viewer to see through it. The transparent nature of the glass is evident as these are visual characteristics of clear glass. Based on this observation and the knowledge that glassware can be crafted with transparency for aesthetic purposes, it seems the teapot allows visibility through it.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the teapot features floral patterns that appear frosted and resemble the rose and leaves engraved in Image A. The coloring and styling of these patterns are akin to frosting techniques often used to add decorative elements to glass. Therefore, there is a visual resemblance to the engraved patterns from the original teapot.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the handle and spout made of tinted amber glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the handle and spout of the teapot show a distinct amber tint. The appearance of the glass being colored suggests the use of tinted glass. Amber-colored glass not only matches the aesthetic but can also be identified through visual cues of the warm, reddish-brown hue. This indicates the handle and spout are indeed made of tinted amber glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored surface showing a clear reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a reflective surface underneath the teapot indicates a mirrored surface. Typically, mirrored surfaces provide clear reflections, and visual cues reinforce this observation as the base seems to display reflection properties. Understanding the properties of mirrors, it is apparent that the surface allows the teapot reflection to be visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the teapot retain the same level of detail and design as the original engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing the intricate engraved floral patterns in Image A with Image B, the frosted floral designs retain similar detail levels and complexity. Frosting can replicate detailed designs found in engravings, which are visible in both images. Thus, the floral patterns in Image B have maintained the design characteristics of the original.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original shape and proportions of the original metallic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the alteration in material and design, Image B's teapot maintains the same shape and proportions as in Image A. The overall silhouette, including the spout, handle, and body curvature, aligns with the metal teapot’s form in Image A. This indicates careful replication of shape even with different materials.",
