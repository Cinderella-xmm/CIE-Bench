      "question": "Does the edited image depict the rock arch as a recognizable stone guardian creature with anthropomorphic or guardian-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows a creature with distinct anthropomorphic features such as two arms, legs, and a head indicative of a guarding stance within the rock arch. The structure and posture suggest it resembles a stone guardian. Recognizing these features align with common depictions of mythical guardians.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible crystalline structures growing along the curved edges of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the creature appears adorned with pointed crystalline structures along its back and sides, which may represent an extension of its form rather than the actual curved edges of the arch. These structures enhance the mythical guardian appearance and are typical of fantasy-style adornments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vein-like lines running across the surface of the arch that follow naturalistic branching patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features bright, vein-like lines traversing the creature's body, creating a pattern appearing to mimic veins or energy flows. These add to the otherworldly aesthetic of the creature, enhancing its mystical presence through the depiction of glowing lines branching symmetrically across its surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original arch outline been replaced with skeletal, wing-like protrusions extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image showcases the creature with large, prominent wings protruding from its back, changing the contour of the original rock arch. This transformation gives the image a dynamic, fantasy element removed from the original static arch structure seen in Image A, which has no extensions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of runic symbols can be identified on the creature's chest, which are etched as luminescent characters. These symbols enhance the mystical theme and imbue the creature with an enchanted aura, distinct from the natural rock surface of the original arch in Image A.",

    {

      "question": "Is there a glowing orb positioned centrally within the arch, acting as a source of radiance and energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a glowing orb centrally located on the creature's chest, suggesting it is a key feature of the design. The orb appears to emit light, contributing to the creature's mystical guardian motif. This feature does not correspond with the natural rock formation seen in Image A, which is devoid of such additions.",
