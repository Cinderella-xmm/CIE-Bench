    "Question": "Q1: Has the original desk and character structure remained unchanged?",

    "Question": "Q2: Has a modern man been added to the image?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there's a distinct difference from traditional Renaissance clothing seen in 'The Last Supper.' A modern man, evident from his contemporary attire, is not present in Image A. This suggests an addition of a modern figure in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the modern man wearing formal attire?",
    "explanation": "The modern man in Image B appears to be wearing a suit, which is commonly associated with formal attire. This contrasts with the historical clothing seen in the original painting in Image A. Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that the modern man is dressed formally.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the modern man raising a glass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the modern figure holds what appears to be a glass, raised in a manner suggestive of a toast. This gesture is commonly associated with celebratory or formal settings. The absence of such a figure or gesture in Image A supports the conclusion that this is an addition specific to Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the modern man placed on the far right empty space of the image?",
