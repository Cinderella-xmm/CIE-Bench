    "Question": "Q1: Does the painting visibly extend beyond its frame to create a 3D effect?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the painting merges seamlessly with the room environment, giving the impression that it extends beyond what might typically be considered a boundary between the painting and the room. The trees and water appear to continue beyond the confines of a frame, suggesting a seamless integration rather than a framed artwork. This effect often gives the illusion of a 3D extension, contributing to the perception that the painting is becoming part of the real environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the elements from the painting visually merge into the room environment, such as appearing on the wall or floor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, typical elements of the painting, like trees and a river, appear seamlessly incorporated into the wall behind the sofa. This kind of visual integration suggests that the painting elements are not confined to a separate framed space but are designed to interact directly with the physical environment of the room.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the transitions between the painting and the room environment smooth without any abrupt edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the elements of the painting and the room's walls appears smooth, without visible or harsh lines that typically denote the edge of a framed painting. This seamless transition indicates a carefully edited integration where the boundary between artwork and room is removed, creating a fluidity between the two.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original elements of the painting, such as trees, water, and the sun, still identifiable in the edited version?",
    "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the fundamental components of the painting—trees, water, and the sun—remain identifiable. Although Image B features an extended canvas that blends the painting into the room, these key elements are preserved and clearly discernible, keeping the original artistic subject matter recognizable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows in the extended portions of the painting match those in the actual room environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the elements extending beyond the frame into the room seems consistent with the lighting conditions of the room. The way light falls on the sofa and the continuation of the painting element suggests an attempt to match the ambient lighting, ensuring there is harmony between the painted extension and actual room lighting and shadows.",
    "answer": "Yes"
