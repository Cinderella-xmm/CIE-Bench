        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene including the canal and the houses is encapsulated within a transparent spherical structure. The boundaries of the sphere are distinct and encompass the depicted miniature scene. This visual cue suggests the use of a spherical container, possibly indicating a diorama or globe-like structure that houses the elements inside.",

        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the canal exhibits a glossy and smooth appearance which is characteristic of a polished resin or a similar material used in miniature models. This visual effect provides a distinctive shine and reflection similar to finished resins, differing from the more natural appearance of real water.",
