      "question": "Is the figure enclosed within a transparent spherical snow globe structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is not contained within a spherical structure as one would expect in a traditional snow globe. Instead, it is surrounded by a circular array of ice shards but open to the surroundings. Based on visual knowledge, a snow globe typically encompasses the scene within a spherical glass or plastic dome, which is absent here.",
