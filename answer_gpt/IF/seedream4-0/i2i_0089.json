      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit a 3D style with depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the kitten as if it's leaping out of a computer screen, which is a common representation of 3D style in digital imagery. The perspective of the kitten extending beyond the frame of the screen creates an illusion of depth, a typical characteristic of 3D effects. This is achieved by the positioning of the kitten, which appears closer to the viewer, and the surrounding environment, reinforcing a three-dimensional feel.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the kitten as actively jumping out of the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the kitten is shown in mid-air with its legs extended forward and tail positioned in a dynamic manner, simulating motion. It visually suggests the action of jumping out of the screen due to these postures and the placement within the image, which combined with the screen acting as a backdrop, strongly implies an active leap rather than a static position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 3D effect in the image achieved without requiring special glasses or external devices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a 3D effect that is visually perceptible without the need for external aids like special glasses. The effect is purely digital and achieved through artistic techniques, such as the kitten appearing to leap out of the screen, generating the perception of depth and reality solely through visual design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the kitten's original appearance, including color and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the edited image with the original, the kitten retains its distinct orange and white fur patterns, as well as its overall texture and facial features. There are no alterations to its color or texture evident in the edited image despite the 3D effect. This consistency helps maintain the recognizable appearance of the cat as seen in the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's features still clearly visible and not obscured by the 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the kitten’s features, including its face, fur, and limbs, are prominently detailed and discernible. The 3D effects emphasize the kitten's features without obstructing them, allowing the viewer to appreciate the kitten’s expression and details clearly, ensuring that no aspects are hidden by the 3D presentation.",
