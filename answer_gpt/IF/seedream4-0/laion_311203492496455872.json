      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle is depicted with swirling patterns and a fluffy texture. The colors used are pastel pink and blue, which resemble the appearance of cotton candy.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the suit with a distinct change in texture and visual style. The suit has a glossy surface that resembles a 3D paper model, with significantly altered geometric patterns that give it a more abstract and stylized look. The transformation shifts the suit from a traditional fabric appearance to an artistic interpretation resembling paper doll aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie is depicted with exaggerated features typical of cartoon styles. It is oversized, with vibrant and contrasting colors, and even includes cartoon-like graphics. This is a departure from a traditional tie and represents an artistic expression through cartoonish exaggeration and color that stands out vividly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial region in both images is not available for comparison due to the blurred area designed to obscure the identity. Given this, no assessment or comparison of facial features and expressions can be accurately made.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the modified elements - the cotton candy hairstyle, paper doll-inspired suit, and cartoon-style tie - are executed in a style consistent with their respective forms without integrating realistic details. The hair mimics cotton candy with pastel colors, the suit reflects a paper doll aesthetic with bold geometrical patterns, and the tie is oversized with vibrant cartoon graphics. This consistency in stylization ensures each element maintains its artistic integrity.",
