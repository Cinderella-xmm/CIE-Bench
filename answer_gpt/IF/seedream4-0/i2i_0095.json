      "question": "Has the word “Shine” been added to the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror prominently displays the word 'Shine' in the center. Based on the visual evidence in Image A, the previous state of the mirror had no such text. The addition of such text is clearly an alteration made in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the word “Shine” positioned centrally in the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mirror in Image B has the word 'Shine' visually and horizontally centered, aligned well within the bounds of the mirror, suggesting an intentional central placement. This central positioning tends to draw the viewer's focus naturally towards the center of the mirror.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' has a luminescent quality, creating an appearance of a glowing light, likely achieved by simulating an inner glow or backlighting effect. This visually suggests that the text is illuminated, providing a soft glow against the mirror's surface.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font used for 'Shine' in Image B is simple and sleek, which correlates well with the modern and minimalistic aesthetic seen throughout the bathroom. The warm, glowing color complements the neutral tones and clean lines, maintaining consistency with the contemporary design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the word 'Shine' in Image B enhances the visual interest without overpowering the minimalistic design elements of the bathroom. It maintains aesthetic balance by being subtle yet noticeable, in harmony with the other design elements like the lighted mirror frame and overall color scheme.",
