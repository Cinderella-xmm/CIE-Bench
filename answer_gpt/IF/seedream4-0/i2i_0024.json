      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a flat illustration-style tennis-themed chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted as a cartoon-like character, resembling a chibi style with exaggerated features such as a large head and small body. The person appears flat and illustrative compared to Image A's realistic style. The transformation from a photographic image to a cartoonish sticker format indicates a change to a chibi illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person depicted in the same original pose as in image A?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sticker shows a different stance from what can be seen in Image A. The original person in Image A is holding the tennis racket facing down, performing a gesture with their other hand. In contrast, the chibi person in Image B holds the racket up, and the body posture is stylized differently to fit the chibi design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi sticker retain a red dress and a white hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is wearing a red dress and a white visor hat, which matches the clothing seen in Image A. This consistency in color and type of attire between the realistic and cartoon versions shows retention of these elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis racket simplified into a black-lined filled shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket is depicted using basic black lines with a simplified design typical of an illustration style. This differs from Image A's racket, which has more realistic details. The simplification into a more cartoonish representation aligns with black outline usage common in stickers or illustrative designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all three matching sticker elements—a tennis ball, a victory V-sign hand, and red clay court lines—generated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, additional elements alongside the chibi include a tennis ball and a victory V-sign hand. The red clay court lines are visible and match the background playing surface. These elements align with the theme and supplement the main sticker, completing a cohesive set.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all stickers have white borders and transparent backgrounds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the chibi illustration and additional stickers like the tennis ball and V-sign hand have visible white outlines around them. The background of these stickers doesn't display any distinct fill, suggesting a transparent background typical for sticker-style images.",
