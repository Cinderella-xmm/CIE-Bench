      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the house as a collection of colorful, geometric shapes that fit within the cubist style, characterized by fragmented planes and the use of varied colors to create a abstract composition. This analysis is supported by the visible amalgamation of angular shapes replacing the architectural details of the house.",
