      "question": "Is the train depicted as a 3D voxel model with a blocky, pixelated appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is indeed shown with a distinct blocky and pixelated appearance. This suggests a 3D voxel style, reminiscent of vintage video game graphics or digital art where objects are built from cubes or pixels. This visual representation aligns with the characteristics of voxel models.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train's 3D voxel model use a similar color palette and design simplicity as the icons shown in the left image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the voxel model uses a limited and straightforward color palette dominated by white, red, and dark tones, which is consistent with simplified graphical representations. In Image A, the train features similar colors but not in a simplified or icon-like form. The use of basic colors in Image B's voxel model maintains design simplicity akin to icons, even if not identical to them.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in high enough detail to suggest an 8k resolution, with no visible pixelation or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is deliberately stylized with a pixelated, voxel aesthetic. This artistic choice results in blocky visuals, common in low-resolution graphics, rather than the smooth details expected of an 8k resolution. Despite the precision of individual voxel 'blocks,' the image as a whole is not smooth or finely detailed. Therefore, it does not meet the characteristics of high-resolution imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train's 3D voxel model exhibit clean, precise shading and lighting effects consistent with those produced by Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does show some form of shading and lighting effects to give depth to the voxel model, it does not demonstrate the clear, precise, and realistic lighting effects typical of a renderer like Octane, which is known for its advanced lighting simulations. The shading and lighting effects in Image B appear more stylized and simpler, consistent with voxel art rather than advanced rendering.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the 3D voxel model of the train retain the original train's proportions and overall shape, making it recognizable despite the stylistic change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, the voxel train maintains the same general proportions and shape as the original. Key features such as the red line along the side and the train's streamlined structure are still clearly identifiable, despite the blocky, voxel rendering. This ensures recognition of the train as the same object from Image A.",
