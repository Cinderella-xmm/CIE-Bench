    "Question": "Q1: Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged in a recognizable outline of a human figure on the plate. This can be primarily deduced from the alignment and arrangement of the sushi, which resemble common features of a human figure such as a head, body, arms, and legs. World knowledge aids in identifying this alignment as a typical representation of a simplified human shape.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the right arm of the sushi person figure appears to be composed of sushi pieces aligned upwards at an angle, suggesting a raised position. This can be concluded by visually tracing the arrangement of sushi pieces from what appears to be the shoulder to the end of the arm, where it is noticeably higher than the rest of the body.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable assembly of sushi that aligns horizontally from the torso, suggesting the presence of a left arm. This arrangement corresponds with the typical location of a left arm on a human body. This coherency in position allows for the interpretation that the figure includes a left arm positioned appropriately.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
