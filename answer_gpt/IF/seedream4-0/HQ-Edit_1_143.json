    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scientist in Image B is rendered in a cartoonish style, characterized by simplified lines and proportionsâ€”a common technique in animation and stylized illustrations. This depiction contrasts with highly realistic illustrations, focusing on basic shapes and clear outlines.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laboratory apparatus including the test tubes and microscope are represented with minimal detail consistent with the cartoon style. Detailed refinement is typically seen in realistic renderings, whereas this image prefers symbolic representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features teal and white colors as its main palette, which aligns with the common theme in scientific and technological depictions aiming for a modern and clean aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image includes multiple calendar sections, each with scientific motifs. While specific structures and patterns may vary, the common theme across the sections is evident, signifying various scientific concepts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headers in Image B have a futuristic, tech-inspired font style, resembling modern digital aesthetics that often accompany scientific calendars or documents.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates data visualization patterns like circular diagrams and layout grids within its design, enhancing the scientific theme and offering visual interest through structured information representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image display a polished, reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The finish of Image B is matte-like, consistent with conventional printed illustrations rather than the polished reflective appearance associated with gloss paper, which would typically show shine and reflection.",
