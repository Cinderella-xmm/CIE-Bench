        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue indicates the presence of the word 'Breathe' located at the top left corner of the image. This text is clearly visible and distinct, suggesting it was added intentionally. The placement at the corner aligns with common formatting choices for unobtrusive overlay text. The analysis is straightforward based on the direct observation of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Calm' is indeed present at the bottom right corner of the image. This location is typical for balance in design and often used to frame content, making this placement logical and consistent with layout norms. The analysis again relies on direct observation from the image and understanding common design practices.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the text \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" use fonts, colors, and sizes suitable for a plant therapy and meditation theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fonts and colors of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' in Image B appear to be carefully selected to match a plant therapy and meditation theme. The fonts are sans-serif which is often associated with simplicity and modernity, keeping in line with themes related to tranquility. The soft, muted color of the text does not distract from the image, supporting a calm and therapeutic atmosphere. This conclusion is derived from comparing typical font choices for wellness-related themes and analyzing the visual harmony in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added texts \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" blend well with the plant and window setting, maintaining the calming atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texts 'Breathe' and 'Calm' are positioned so they do not clash with the visual or theme of Image B. Their understated color and size complement the natural and serene setting of the plant at the window, supporting the calming atmosphere. The placement is careful to avoid dominating the scene, thus enhancing the theme rather than detracting from it. This analysis is based on assessing the design cohesion and thematic clarity in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the texts \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" positioned in a way that does not obscure the central visual elements of the plant and window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text placements at the top left and bottom right corners ensure that the central elements (the plant and window) are unobscured. This strategic positioning allows the viewer's attention to remain focused on these primary elements, adhering to visual hierarchy principles where text serves to complement rather than distract from the main subject. This conclusion is drawn from the observation that the text does not overlap key visual elements.",
