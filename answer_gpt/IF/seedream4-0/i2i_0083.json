        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall shows a digital display screen instead of a painting. The painting, which featured a sunset scene, is no longer present; this indicates the painting has been removed. The absence of the art piece replaced by a different object clearly shows removal.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital screen in Image B displays information typical of a weather forecast, including atmospheric pressures, temperatures, and weather symbols like clouds and lightning. These are common elements of real-time weather imagery, suggesting it shows weather data.",

        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The room layout in Image B remains consistent with the original setup in Image A. The chairs and flooring are identical in both images, and the new digital display maintains the wall's balance, as it fits well in the previously used space. Thus, the overall composition and balance appear unchanged.",
