    "Question": "Q2: Are large, solid-colored sections used to define the muscular figureâ€™s anatomy, such as chest, arms, and legs, replacing fine shading or gradient effects?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the muscular figure depicted with large sections of solid colors, particularly red, blue, and green.
