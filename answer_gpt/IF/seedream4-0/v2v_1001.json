      "question": "Is there a ketchup bottle positioned in the lower-right corner of the image, angled slightly toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a ketchup bottle in the lower-right corner is evident. The bottle is visually oriented in a way that suggests it's angled slightly towards the center of the image, as indicated by its position in relation to the rest of the elements. This configuration matches the description in the question. Based on this visual evidence combined with common sense about object positioning, the analysis supports the presence of a ketchup bottle as described.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clear text reading “The king of flavors” that is prominently positioned near the middle of the image. The text appears to be centered and highlighted within the composition of the image. This placement makes it a central focus, aligning with the description given in the question.",

      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” crafted in a glossy, ketchup-style script font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text “The king of flavors” in Image B has a distinctly glossy and shiny appearance, resembling the texture of ketchup. The style of the font is scripted, which complements its ketchup-like appearance. This visual styling suggests an intentional design choice to emulate the glossy texture of ketchup, confirming the description in the question.",

      "question": "Do the letters of “The king of flavors” appear to hover in the air and subtly mingle with the mist of the forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text appears to be suspended above the dinosaur, exhibiting a visually floating effect. Additionally, the mist from the forest seems to mingle with the text, enhancing its ethereal quality and emphasizing the appearance of the text floating amidst the mist. This visual observation supports the claim that the letters are interacting with the mist in the forest setting.",

      "question": "Are there streams of ketchup visually linking back to the opened bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, streams of a red substance, presumably ketchup, are visually depicted as flowing from the text back towards the bottle positioned in the lower-right corner. These streams create a continuous link that is apparent in the image composition, indicating a direct connection between the text and the opened ketchup bottle.",
