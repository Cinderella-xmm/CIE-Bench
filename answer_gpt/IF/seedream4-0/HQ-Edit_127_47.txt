    "Question": "Q3: Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
    "explanation": "The water within the orb in Image B appears exceptionally clear and layered, exhibiting properties similar to resin art, where textures and transparency enhance depth perception. This gives a sense of realism and artistic clarity, distinct from the natural look outside the orb, suggesting an artificial enhancement to mimic depth and clarity.",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the glass orb resting on a natural wood base with visible organic textures such as grain or bark?",
    "explanation": "At the bottom of the glass orb in Image B, there is a circular wood base with visible grain patterns and possibly even remnants of bark, consistent with naturally textured wood. This detail matches the presence of a crafted element where natural materials are used to augment the orb's display.",
