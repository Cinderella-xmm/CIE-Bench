      "question": "Has the wooden surface been replaced with an elegant marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface on which the objects are placed has a distinct appearance consistent with marble, characterized by its smooth surface and veining pattern. This is a departure from the wooden texture evident in Image A, which shows a grainy look typical of wood. The perceived switch to marble enhances the refined and elegant perception commonly associated with high-end product presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible label on the teapot's image, and the text 'Earl Grey Elegance' is clearly legible.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible monogram logo on the lid of the teapot itself. Instead, the logo appears on the top of the packaging box. The golden 'B' monogram on the box is designed to give a luxurious feel, but it does not appear on the teapot image.",
