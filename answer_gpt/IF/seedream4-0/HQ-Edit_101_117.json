      "question": "Is the mannequin now rendered as a stone sculpture rather than a metallic or plastic figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture, color, and overall appearance suggest a stone-like material, with a matte and slightly rough surface that is characteristic of stone sculptures. This contrasts with the likely metallic or plastic appearance in the traditional shiny or polished look of mannequins. The conversion to a stone sculpture is evident from the consistent stone texture throughout the figure.",

      "question": "Are delicate floral and paisley motifs carved into the stone surface of the saree and body, reflecting the original embroidery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone surface of the saree and the body of the figure prominently display intricate designs that resemble floral and paisley motifs. These seem to be carved into the stone rather than simply being part of a textile, thereby replicating the original embroidery patterns seen in traditional fabric designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jewelry elements, such as necklaces and bracelets, in Image B appear to be part of the stone sculpture itself, with details chiseled into the surface. This suggests a conversion from separate accessory items to stone carvings integrated into the sculpture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the stone seems to have an aged appearance, featuring a matte and possibly slightly rough texture typical of weathered ancient stone sculptures. This visual detail suggests a surface consistent with antiquity.",
