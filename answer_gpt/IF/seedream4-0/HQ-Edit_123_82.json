      "question": "Is the woman's figure stylized in a cartoon-like manner with exaggerated proportions or simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is rendered in a cartoon-like style with simplified features, which is typical in illustrations where emphasis is not on realistic portrayal but rather on stylization. The outlines and colors are more defined, contributing to a cartoonish look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible gold embroidery details added to the red dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress has gold embroidery details that add decorative elements to the garment, enhancing its visual appeal. These details are not present in Image A, where the dress lacks such embellishments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings significantly larger than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based solely on Image B, the butterfly wings appear to be proportionate to the woman's figure and do not exhibit drastic enlargement beyond what would be typically associated with their initial appearance. Without direct comparison to Image A, it's challenging to assert significant size change convincingly.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the butterfly wings display intricate and stylized patterns that simulate the natural texture of real butterfly wings, such as fine veins and layered patterns, adding detail and realism to an otherwise stylized image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings do not exhibit the names of the months; instead, these are shown in separate calendar elements around the central character. The wings themselves contain no textual information about the months.",
      "weight": 1,

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B is indeed set against a wooden panel background, which includes floral inlay patterns. These elements contribute to the aesthetic and thematic aspects of the artwork.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of wood grain, floral patterns, and the organized calendar setup gives the impression of a carefully crafted, artisanal piece, suggesting that it might be intended as a collectible item. These elements are characteristic of decorative and collectible art items.",
