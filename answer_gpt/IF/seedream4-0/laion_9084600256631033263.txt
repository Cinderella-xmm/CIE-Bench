    "Question": "Q5: Does the decanter design combine vintage styling (such as classic curves or script) with modern branding elements (such as clean lines or minimalist text)?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a design that integrates classic car curves with modern metallic and glass-like finishes. The vintage style is maintained through the vehicle's shape and emblems, while the chrome shine and reflective surfaces introduce modern elements. The branding 'Datsun 2000' is sleek and reflects a more contemporary aesthetic. Comparatively, Image A has the vintage styling but lacks the modern transformative elements seen in Image B.",
