      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of surrealism such as dreamlike or unexpected juxtapositions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of unconventional elements, such as a blue-painted figure holding an abstract, levitating geometric golden shape and a swirling, dreamlike background, signifies characteristics of surrealism. These elements create an unexpected and fantastical imagery, aligning with world knowledge about surrealism's focus on dreamlike experiences and unusual combinations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there abstract shapes and bold contrasts present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays several abstract elements, including the geometric form held by the blue figure and the swirling, colorful patterns in the background. The bold contrast between the blue skin and the gold objects enhances the abstraction and visual impact, reflecting world knowledge that abstract art often utilizes strong contrasts and unconventional shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold banana depicted as a levitating geometric form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object held by the figure in Image B is a geometric shape and appears levitating. This differs from Image A, where the figure is holding a tangible banana. Based on the visual cues and world knowledge that levitation and geometric shapes are distinct from ordinary objects like bananas, the comparison indicates a shift from a banana to an abstract levitating form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the blue figure display liquefying textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue figure exhibits a texture that appears to be dripping or melting, consistent with world knowledge about liquefaction as a visual effect in art to create fluidity and transformation. This effect is absent in Image A, where the figure simply has blue-painted skin without texture changes suggesting liquefaction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the background feature warped components that contribute to a fantastical atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a colorful and swirling background with distorted elements, contributing to a fantastical and dreamlike atmosphere. This assessment, based on visual observation and world knowledge, identifies that warp and distortion are characteristics used to create imaginative and otherworldly environments, aligning with the principles of creating a surreal atmosphere.",
