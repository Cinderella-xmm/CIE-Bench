      "question": "Has the head been slightly enlarged compared to the original body proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image presents the subject with a distinctly larger head compared to a small body, typical of chibi or caricature styles, where exaggerated head sizes are common. This contrasts with Image A, where the head-to-body proportion is normal. This change signifies that the head has indeed been enlarged compared to the original body's proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the body been cartoonified with flattened colors and simple shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the body with simple geometric shapes, flat color tones, and a lack of texture detail, which is a hallmark of cartoon or chibi representations. This simplification and abstraction from realistic forms support the idea that the body has been cartoonified.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the edited subject placed against a background resembling a bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of rows of books with visible spines and shelving, resembling a classic bookshelf setting, which is consistent with the background seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the eyes, smile, and proportions accurately maintained after enlarging the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that the face in Image B is blurred, we can't assess the accuracy of the facial features. However, typically in chibi-style edits, facial proportions and details such as eyes and smiles are exaggerated rather than maintained accurately.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cartoonified body appear separate from and non-intrusive to the realistic face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoonified body is distinctively separate from realistic facial representations due to its simplified and abstract nature, even when the face in Image B is blurred, the disconnection between a realistic facial style and a cartoon body generally still holds true.",
