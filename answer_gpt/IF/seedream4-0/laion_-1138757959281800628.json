      "question": "Is the entire hotel and pool scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hotel and pool scene appears surrounded by a transparent glass structure, resembling a terrarium, as indicated by the rounded glass edges enclosing the scene. This visual detail suggests that the scene is contained within a glass enclosure. The context is informed by recognizing the visual cue of glass reflections and boundaries typical of terrarium setups.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the pool display layered water effects, such as visible depth layers or textured surface ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool shows distinct layers, visible as uneven steps or terraces underwater, contributing to a layered visual effect. These visible features are consistent with the concept of layered water effects in design or art installations. The visual cue of distinct pool depth layers leads to the conclusion that the pool has layered water effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sunbathers and surrounding trees visibly miniaturized in size relative to the building and pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunbathers and trees in the scene appear notably smaller in proportion, akin to miniature figures often seen in model or diorama setups, relative to the hotel and pool. This miniaturization is visually indicated by their size relative to major structural elements in the scene, suggesting an intentional scaling down to fit a model replica design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there fabricated cascading greenery visibly growing from the rooftop of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows greenery cascading down from the rooftop, appearing as vines and plants hanging over the hotel's sides. These visually appear fabricated rather than natural, considering their deliberate, artistic placement and arrangement on a scaled-down model of the hotel scene. The visual presence of greenery arranged over the building points to artificial greenery integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are small, whimsical beach accessories (e.g., toy floats, tiny buckets, or miniature umbrellas) placed near the edge of the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small, beach-themed items visibly near the pool's edge, including toy-like accessories typical of miniaturized beach scenes. These objects are discernible as whimsical, due to their scale and design typical in model setups, contributing to the playful design theme portrayed in this edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there floating 3D cloud elements positioned above the scene, distinct from the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several 3D clouds suspended above the scene are visible, distinctly different from the background sky, suggesting artificial, floating elements added to the edited scene. These floating cloud shapes add a whimsical, artistic touch distinct from natural sky features.",
