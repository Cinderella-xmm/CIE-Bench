      "question": "Does the edited image feature bold outlines and dramatic halftone shading on the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with thick, bold outlines that are typical of comic book styles. Halftone shading is evident in the yellow background and parts of the illustration, creating a dramatic effect. This style is distinct from traditional flat coloring and adds depth and texture to the image. Based on these visual cues, the character in Image B indeed features bold outlines and halftone shading, which is more pronounced than in Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a grimy cityscape included in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a detailed cityscape in the background with buildings that have a gritty, worn-out look. The use of black lines and shading gives the buildings an aged and smoggy appearance, suggesting a grimy cityscape. This is a typical portrayal of urban environments in certain types of art to convey mood and setting. Image A, in contrast, lacks this detailed background, focusing more on a simplified iconography.",

      "question": "Has the yellow circle been incorporated as a dramatic background element in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large yellow circle is clearly used as a dramatic background element behind the character, reminiscent of a sunburst or spotlight effect, which helps highlight the character and add visual interest to the overall composition. It creates a focal point and adds a sense of dynamism and drama. Image A also contains a yellow circle but is used more as a simple background component rather than a dramatic element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a text caption at the bottom saying 'Just another day cleaning the city's lungs.' The font and placement of the caption suggest a thematic connection to the gritty cityscape, aligning with the visual style of the image. The wording of the caption complements the scene depicted, matching both tone and context. Such captions are common in narrative art to convey an underlying message or theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is clearly shown standing beside a brick chimney, with a posture and gaze that suggest they are surveying the cityscape laid out below. This positioning is effective for illustrating the subject's profession or role within the environment. Image A also features the character next to a chimney but lacks the broader cityscape context present in Image B.",
