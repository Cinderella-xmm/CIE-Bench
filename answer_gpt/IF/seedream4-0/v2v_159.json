      "question": "Have the shoes been increased in size while keeping their original design intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear larger than what one might expect for a normal shoe size in proportion to the legs, creating a sense of exaggeration typical of cartoon or stylized imagery. The original design elements such as the laces, paneling, and general style remain consistent with a typical sneaker design, albeit in a larger size. The visual cues suggest that the shoes are indeed larger but maintain the core design traits that sneakers would have.",

      "question": "Do the legs appear more cartoon-like compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays legs that are very cleanly segmented, with smooth transitions and rounded edges, typical of a cartoon representation. The texture is not realistic; instead, it appears simplified and stylized, contributing to a cartoon-like appearance. In comparison, the original image (Image A) shows legs with more realistic proportions and textures. This difference emphasizes the cartoon-style transformation in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the feet placed on a shelf shaped like clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the shoes are positioned on a structured platform, which contrasts with the pure cloud background seen in Image A. The platform has a shape reminiscent of clouds, especially as the design maintains the rounded, soft contours typical of cloud formations. This distinct placement implies the feet are indeed on something shelf-like while maintaining thematic elements inspired by the cloud surroundings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall appearance of the legs and shoes reflect a bobblehead-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A bobblehead-style transformation usually involves exaggerated proportions where certain elements are enlarged relative to others. In Image B, the shoes are exaggerated in size, contrasting with the proportions and detailing of the legs, which maintain a consistent cylindrical appearance. This kind of disproportion between elements suggests a stylistic approach akin to bobblehead decorative figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shoes still maintain their original design details after being resized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the size of the shoes has been exaggerated, they retain specific design elements consistent with typical sneaker designâ€”such as laces, panel configurations, and overall styling. These details align with the visual characteristics noted in Image A despite the scale increase. Thus, the core design details remain intact despite the change.",
