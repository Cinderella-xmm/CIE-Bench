        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no phone or stand visible; instead, the scene focuses on a table that appears to be a seaside café setting. The area occupied in Image A by a phone and stand is replaced in Image B by a table surface reflecting the sea waves. This indicates that the phone and stand have indeed been removed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass-topped table with reflections that resemble a coastal scene, including sunlight and waves, characteristic of a seaside café atmosphere. This transformation from the first image, which depicts a simple phone charger stand, supports the conclusion that the scene has been replaced with a seaside café tabletop setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop clearly displays reflections that mimic waves and the shimmering effect of sunlight on water, suggesting the imagery of sea waves and sunlight. These visual cues, commonly associated with seaside settings, are present and visible, affirming that these details are indeed portrayed on the tabletop.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains elements traditionally found in café settings, such as chairs placed around tables. The view of the beach in the background further enhances the seaside café atmosphere. These elements collectively contribute to the creation of a café environment near the sea.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a realistic portrayal of a tabletop from a seaside café, with the angle and composition providing a coherent perspective. The reflection details and arrangement of furniture, including chairs and tables, maintain consistency with real-world cafés located near coasts, ensuring the realism of the scene.",
