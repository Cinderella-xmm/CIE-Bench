      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted as a wood-carved sculpture rather than a living animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is clearly depicted as a wooden sculpture. The surface of the gorilla has a glossy wood texture, and it appears carved rather than having the appearance of a living organism. The visual cues of a wooden surface and carved details align with the characteristics of a sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the gorilla with a wooden texture, and its contours are indeed defined using various shades of brown, which is typical of wood grain patterns seen in wooden sculptures.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are detailed fur-like textures engraved into the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the gorilla in Image B has detailed fur-like textures engraved into it. This is evident from the carved lines that mimic the appearance of fur on the wooden surface.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arms and legs of the sculpture visibly smoother than the rest of the body, lacking fine anatomical detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and legs of the wooden sculpture appear smoother than the rest of the body and lack the same level of fine anatomical detail. This is typical in wooden sculptures where certain parts may be polished more.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the leafy backdrop been replaced with an etched wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a leafy backdrop, there is an etched wooden surface which serves as the background for the sculpture. The visual change from a natural environment to a carved wood design indicates this transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there a few dark-toned leaf shapes integrated into the wooden background, matching the wood carving style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features dark-toned leaf shapes that are integrated into the wooden background, aligning with the overall wood carving style. These elements resemble inlays or carved additions to a wooden surface.",

    },
