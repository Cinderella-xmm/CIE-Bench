        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is the edited image, the setting has dramatically changed to what appears to be a castle hall interior with stone walls and arches, indicative of a historical or medieval style. There is no sign of modern elements such as a wall clock, as seen in Image A that features a clock with a contemporary design. The architectural style in Image B does not typically include wall clocks as one would find in a modern interior setting.",

      "question": "Is the wooden cabinet still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior has changed to what appears to be a large hall typical of a castle. The floor is made of wooden planks, typical of such settings, but there is no evidence of a contemporary wooden cabinet present in the image, as seen in Image A. Instead, the space is open and devoid of such furnishings.",

      "question": "Does the edited image show elements typical of a castle hall interior, such as stone walls or arches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a setting that includes stone walls and vaulted ceilings with arches â€” architectural features commonly associated with castle halls or medieval architecture. This is markedly different from Image A's modern residence setting with clean walls and contemporary furniture.",

      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image match the lighting style from the original image, with similar shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B showcases large, natural light entering through what appear to be tall windows or arches, producing long shadows on the large open floor. This differs from Image A, which shows direct sunlight casting more angular shadows within a smaller domestic space. The style and effect of lighting are adapted to their respective different environments and thus do not match.",

      "question": "Are there any remaining objects from the original scene, such as vases or plants, in the castle hall setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that the setting does not include any of the decor found in Image A, no modern furniture, vases, or plants. The focus is instead on the architectural design, with no visible modern decorative objects.",
