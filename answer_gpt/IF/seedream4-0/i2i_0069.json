    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a holographic projection screen added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a holographic projection screen visible above the sandwich. This is characterized by glowing lines and a translucent appearance, suggesting a digital projection. This type of element does not exist in reality under normal circumstances and indicates a digital effect typically associated with visual media.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection appear to emerge from the man's phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The projection appears to be in alignment with the man's phone, with its base close to or originating from where the phone is being held. This visual cue simulates the effect of the projection emerging from the phone, which is a common sci-fi theme where devices display information as interactive holograms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen display a city map interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interface on the holographic projection features what looks like a grid-like pattern with structures resembling buildings and streets, characteristic of a city map. This visual resemblance to map elements suggests that the projection represents a city map interface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the holographic projection screen designed in a futuristic and transparent style characteristic of sci-fi elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The projection is depicted with a translucent and glowing appearance, including intricate technological graphics, which are typical attributes of a futuristic styling in science fiction. This portrayal aligns with how media often visualizes advanced technology.",

      "question": "Is the rest of the image consistent with the original, without additional unintended changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, all elements such as the sandwich, table, and green-handled knife remain unchanged except for the addition of the holographic screen. No other unintended edits appear within the rest of the scene, ensuring consistency outside the intended alteration.",
