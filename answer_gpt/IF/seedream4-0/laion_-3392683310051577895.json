      "question": "Are the armrests of the sofa transformed into curled horn-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests of the sofa have been visually altered to resemble curled horn-like structures. This conclusion is drawn from the clear visual cues of spiraling, textured shapes on both sides of the sofa, which are reminiscent of horns. Combining this observation with common knowledge about horn shapes, it is evident that these are indeed intended to look like animal horns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the tufted patterns on the sofa been replaced with bark-textured scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture of the sofa is significantly different from typical tufted patterns. Instead, the texture resembles bark, characterized by a rough and uneven surface. This texture mimics natural bark, rather than any fabric tufting, suggesting that the tufted patterns have been replaced with a more natural, bark-like appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cushions transformed into a mossy, leafy mane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the sofa where cushions are typically found is covered with a dense layer of moss and leaves, indicating a deliberate transformation into a natural, plant-like appearance. This gives the impression of a mane made up of moss and foliage, replacing traditional cushions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing emerald eyes positioned above the center cushion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that above the central part of the sofa, there are visually striking features that resemble glowing emerald eyes. These are two bright, glowing green orbs positioned where eyes might logically be placed if the sofa were imagined as a creature, reinforcing the transformation theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits wooden elements extending from beneath the sofa, shaped like limbs with claws. These are distinct from the structure of a typical sofa and are wrapped with vine-like details, indicating a transformation into a creature-like form with wooden, clawed limbs.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a mystical aura through faint glows and ethereal patterns swirling on certain areas of the sofa's wood-textured surface. These effects suggest an integration of mythical energy, enhancing the fantastical transformation of the sofa.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the transformed sofa retain the original shape and positioning while incorporating the fantastical elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image A and Image B, the basic shape and positioning of the sofa remain consistent, with the fantastical elements layered onto the original structure. The image retains the original sofa's form while also incorporating various magical and mythical transformations such as textures, extensions, and added features like 'horns' and 'eyes.'",
