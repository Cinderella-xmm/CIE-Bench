      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner consistent with 1920s Art Deco fashion illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall appearance is that of a stylized illustration which matches the aesthetic commonly found in 1920s Art Deco fashion illustrations. The sharp lines, geometric designs, and specific art style are indicative of that era's artistic style. This is a departure from Image A, which is a photo-realistic image. The recognition of the illustrative, stylized manner in Image B is due to these art-specific features.",

      "question": "Does the dress feature a flapper-style silhouette with geometric patterns and fringe along the hem or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress has a distinct flapper-style silhouette, which is typically a loose-fitting dress often associated with the 1920s. The geometric patterns and fringe along the hem are prominent features of this style. These elements are characteristic of flapper dresses that became popular in the Art Deco era. Image A, in contrast, does not exhibit these specific features as it showcases a more contemporary form-fitting design without geometric patterns and fringe.",

      "question": "Has the bag been replaced with a beaded clutch featuring detailed beadwork and a design consistent with 1920s fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is depicted as a small, beaded clutch that complements the overall 1920s fashion theme. The detailing and beadwork are consistent with accessories from that time, which were known for intricate designs and elegance. In contrast, Image A presents a small leopard print bag with a chain and fringe, differing significantly in style from the simpler and elegant clutch in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the shoes now T-strap style with a refined, vintage design suitable for the 1920s?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes are shown as T-strap style, which was popular during the 1920s. This design is characterized by a strap running across the foot and another going vertically over the ankle, which is visually evident in Image B. These shoes complement the vintage theme portrayed in the image. Conversely, Image A features thick platform heels that are more modern and lack the vintage T-strap design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of bold, linear geometric patterns in gold and black, which align with the Art Deco movement known for such design elements. These patterns and color schemes are a distinctive feature of Art Deco style, often associated with luxury and modernity of the 1920s and 1930s. Image A lacks any specific background, focusing solely on the subject without decorative patterns.",
