    {

      "question": "Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair appears to be constructed largely from LEGO-style bricks. The seat and backrest show the characteristic studs on LEGO bricks, confirming the use of these bricks in their construction. However, the entire structure, including the base and wheels, seems to incorporate elements that don't strictly adhere to LEGO-style construction due to the more realistic rendering of the metallic components. Therefore, the chair isn't constructed entirely from LEGO-style bricks as the base and wheels retain a realistic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat and backrest in Image B are constructed with visible LEGO bricks in black. These bricks have the distinct studs characteristic of LEGO, which resemble LEGO in their appearance rather than traditional sleek cushions. Hence, the reference to sleek cushions does not apply here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the armrests and the base of the chair are depicted in a metallic silver color. This is observed through their shiny, reflective appearance, which is typical for metal or chrome finishes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B appear to be translucent and are rendered in a gray color. This is evidenced by their see-through quality and the gray hue visible in their material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat and backrest in Image B are composed of individual LEGO bricks, which do not exhibit smooth gradients between them. Instead, the transition between each brick is distinct and sharp due to the individual brick edges and the presence of studs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests in Image B appear to be a single curved metallic piece, which resembles a hinge but does not appear to have any padding or complex design beyond its basic metal silhouette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface under the chair is a plain white color, suggesting a tabletop. There are no visible textures or colors that would indicate otherwise, confirming the chair's placement on a plain white tabletop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features the modular construction of the chair through the use of LEGO bricks, which inherently have geometric shapes and visible edges. The clean lines are defined by the straight edges of the bricks, emphasizing the modular nature of the chair's design.",
