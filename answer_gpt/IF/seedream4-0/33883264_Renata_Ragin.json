      "question": "Has the Brooklyn Bridge been transformed into a colossal, humanoid stone golem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Brooklyn Bridge is depicted as being integrated into a colossal stone golem, with the structure of the bridge intertwined with the golem's form. The original Image A shows the iconic bridge spanning across the river. The transformation in Image B illustrates the bridge as part of the armature of a giant stone figure, signifying a creative reimagining of the original scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suspension cables and the structure of the Brooklyn Bridge resemble arms that extend from the shoulders of the golem. This differs from the original depiction in Image A, where these elements are simply components of the bridge’s architecture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the cables of the Brooklyn Bridge are imagined as sinewy structures that wrap around and integrate with the chest area of the stone golem. This artistic transformation contrasts with Image A, where the cables are solely functional elements of the bridge.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
