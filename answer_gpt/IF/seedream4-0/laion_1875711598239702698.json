      "question": "Has the body of each elephant been transformed into an elegant, curved bottle shape with a defined neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bodies of the elephants have been reshaped into tall, elegant, and curved structures that resemble bottles. The design incorporates a neck section that tapers toward where the elephant head is positioned, which is typical of bottle designs, especially premium fragrance bottles. This transformation from traditional elephant statue forms to bottle shapes signifies a deliberate alteration intended to create a floral aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the elephant's ears now shaped like gold-trimmed caps positioned at the top of the bottle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears have been redesigned to resemble gold-trimmed caps. These caps are placed at the very top of the bottle-like structures, giving the appearance that they serve a functional role, typical of bottle caps. This contrasts with the original elephant statues in Image A, where ears naturally extend from the head.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the previous glittering texture seen on the elephants' backs in Image A has been replaced with a mosaic pattern made up of small reflective tiles. This change transforms the aesthetic from one of a rustic texture to a more polished and reflective look, which is common in high-end product designs like perfumes or decorative arts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no apparent brand logo placed along the trunk of the elephants. The trunks appear to be free of additional text or branding elements that would indicate a logo placement, focusing more on the design aesthetic rather than brand identification on this particular feature.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a minimalist label that likely contains a fragrance name is present on the body of each bottle. This is a common feature in perfume bottles, where elegance and minimalism in labeling are favored over more elaborate branding to maintain an upscale appearance.",
