        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is presented with a tall, narrow frame that is reminiscent of the shape of a bookmark. This vertical arrangement is in contrast to the more standard aspect ratio seen in Image A, suggesting it was resized to achieve this bookmark-like appearance.",
