        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements around the gnome, such as the soil, seed packet, and the way the entire scene is staged, are characteristic of a product package design.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
