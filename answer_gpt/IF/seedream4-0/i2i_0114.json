      "question": "Has the original desk and character structure remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and character arrangement is largely consistent with the original painting, 'The Last Supper,' where the characters sit behind a long table. The positions, postures, and table setup have not been altered with the exception of the added modern figure. This analysis is based on recognizing the iconic scene and comparing the unchanged elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image, Image B, shows an additional figure standing on the far right side of 'The Last Supper' composition. This figure is dressed in contemporary clothing, distinctly different from the traditional attire of the original characters. This modern man is not part of the original composition, indicating an edit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the newly added figure is wearing a black tuxedo with a white shirt, which is a typical formal dress code. This attire contrasts sharply with the historical garments of the other characters in 'The Last Supper,' highlighting the man's modernity.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the modern man is seen lifting a wine glass in his right hand, which is a gesture typically associated with a toast or celebration. This action distinguishes him from the original scene's solemn context.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man is positioned at the far right edge of the scene, which makes use of the outermost space and does not interfere with the original group arrangement. This placement is away from traditional lineups in historical depictions, thus standing out distinctly.",
