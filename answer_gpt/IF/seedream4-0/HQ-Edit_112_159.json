    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the car and coastal road enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible edges and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues such as the transparent glass edges and reflections on the surfaces suggest that the entire scene, including the car and coastal road, is enclosed within a glass display case. These reflections and the squared edges distinctly point to a glass enclosure commonly used in displays, showcasing objects within.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car exhibit metallic red coloring with visible gradient hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B has a shiny surface with metallic properties, characterized by reflective gradient hues visible across its body. Such visual characteristics are common in metallic paint finishes, which change in shade with the contour and light angles, indicating the presence of a metallic red finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines present on the car’s bodywork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car displays dynamic design lines, with well-defined curves and sharp details on the bodywork. Such aerodynamic features are typical of high-performance sports cars to enhance both aesthetics and functionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road and cliff structures appear to have a layered effect, indicative of being constructed from resin. The visible stratification and depth clues are characteristic of layered resin art, designed to give a three-dimensional appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of Image B shows a texture that mimics micro gravel, suggesting a realistic element embedding. This textured appearance resembles resin creations where such effects are added for authenticity or artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the display shows a panel with vivid sunset colors. Such placement at the top boundary of the display case mimicking the sky strongly indicates a diorama technique to enhance the realism and thematic continuity within the glass case.",
