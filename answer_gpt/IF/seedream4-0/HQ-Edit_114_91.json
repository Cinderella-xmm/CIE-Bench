      "question": "Has the anvil and hammer been transformed into a single cohesive enchanted forest guardian creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an entire transformation is evident wherein the anvil and hammer together appear to form a mythical or enchanted creature. The anvil now serves as the base supporting an owl-like figure, integrating aspects of a forest guardian, such as the integration of ivy and moss on its surface. This transformation highlights a unity into a single cohesive entity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the previously rusted surfaces of the anvil and hammer now covered in moss-like textures and crawling ivy tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the surfaces of what used to be a rusted anvil and hammer in Image A, now enveloped by moss and ivy tendrils. This detail supports the transformation into a naturalistic, enchanted setting, replacing rust with vibrant, organic textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the hammerhead been morphed into an owl-like face with visible ivy forming the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammerhead is replaced entirely by the figure of an owl, which includes the owl's face. The visible part designated as eyes appear to be made from glowing spots, presumably integrated with ivy patterns. Thus, it presents an owl-like appearance rather than any remnant of the hammerhead.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the anvilâ€™s main body resemble a tree trunk with root-like structures extending beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a significant change where the anvil's body appears to resemble a tree trunk, complete with detailed textures matching tree bark and roots extending from beneath. This transformation is suggestive of a natural element being incorporated into the structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing emerald-colored runes etched into the surface of the anvil/creature, blending naturally with the wood texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features glowing emerald-colored runes on what can now be considered the anvil's surface designed as a tree trunk. These runes seamlessly integrate into the natural aesthetic of the wood texture, supporting the enchantment theme.",
