      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the character is depicted as an anime girl, which is evident from the art style typical of 'moe' characters — cute, with exaggerated features such as large eyes and a youthful appearance.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of the edited image, the anime character is depicted skiing downhill with a sense of determination.

      "question": "In Panel 2, does the character show a frustrated, flustered expression with wide eyes and sweat drops, and is she depicted falling into the snow with skis and poles flying?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second panel, the character is seated in the snow, which suggests a fall, given the upturned position of skis and the scattered poles. The dynamic pose indicates surprise or frustration, common reactions associated with such incidents in anime. Sweat drops usually signify flustered or stressed emotions. Even though the face is blurred, body language and the context suggest these emotions.",
