      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is predominantly white with visible snow and icebergs, which are indicative of a polar or Arctic environment. Icebergs are floating masses of ice commonly found in polar regions and are usually associated with snowy landscapes. This is different from Image A, which shows a more traditional garden setting with soil and greenery in the background. The presence of icebergs and snow strongly suggests that the background has been replaced with an Arctic setting.",

      "question": "Are the carrots still rooted in soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are visible above what appears to be a patch of soil. Despite the snowy background, the carrots seem to be firmly planted in a section of dark soil. This is similar to Image A, where the carrots are also shown emerging from the soil. The presence of the soil around the base of the carrots in Image B indicates they are still rooted in it.",

      "question": "Do the carrots retain their original appearance in terms of color and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots in Image B have a bright orange color and a rounded shape with green tops. Comparing this to Image A, where the carrots also display a similar bright orange color and rounded form, it's evident that their appearance has remained consistent between the two images. There are no noticeable differences in color or shape, meaning the carrots retain their original appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image show a clear contrast between the Arctic background and the soil around the carrots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent contrast between the white snowy background with icebergs and the dark soil in which the carrots are planted. This creates a visual distinction between the Arctic elements and the ground, highlighting the unusual setting of the carrots growing in soil amidst snow. Image A, in contrast, does not have such a stark visual difference as it shows a regular garden setting. The stark visual contrast in Image B emphasizes the mixture of climates present in the image.",

      "question": "Is the overall setting of the image consistent with an Arctic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features elements typically associated with an Arctic environment: snow and icebergs. These elements suggest a cold, polar setting, which aligns with common visual interpretations of Arctic regions. While the presence of soil and carrots introduces an atypical element for such an environment, the background is heavily indicative of an Arctic landscape. The consistency is reinforced by the predominant presence of snow and ice.",
