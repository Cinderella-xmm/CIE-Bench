    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the woman’s outfit and overall image been rendered in a cartoon style with exaggerated features and simplified lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines are clean and simplified, consistent with cartoon or illustration styles. The detail precision common in real-life images is absent, as shown in the smoothness of textures and defined lines of the outfit—consistent with exaggerated features often found in cartoons.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the outfit significantly larger or more stylized than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features floral patterns that are more pronounced and designed with bold, clear lines, typical of stylized art. Image A shows more detailed and intricate floral embroidery typical of real life, which tends to be finer and more complex.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the clasp of the outfit been redesigned to feature intricate patterns resembling jade in color and detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clasp has been altered to present a pattern with smooth, extensive lines that suggest an artistic rendition rather than authentic embroidery. The color is more vibrant and simulates jade-like qualities through its clarity and stylized form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits vivid and saturated colors which stand out as brighter and more intense compared to Image A's more natural, subdued tones, in line with a cartoon or illustrative style that often uses vivid colors for impact.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly defined areas resembling cards or sections with a detailed border on a bright background, true to a design feature that stands out vividly. These elements are absent in Image A, where the focus is solely on the garment without such additions.",
