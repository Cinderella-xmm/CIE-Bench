    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has been reimagined with features strongly resembling an owl: a defined head, a body shaped with detailed feather-like patterns, and feet gripping a branch. While the object is stylized and still incorporates elements of a teapot (e.g., spout, handle), its overall silhouette and prominent features such as the face and wings clearly resemble an owl. This reasoning draws on the visual cues specific to bird anatomy found in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lid of the original teapot form the crown-like head of the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a crown-like structure on the owl's head, which suggests a transformation of the teapot's lid. The intricate design and position on top of the owl's head support the inference that this is an adaptation of the original lid, maintaining the ornate and elevated position characteristic of both a crown and a teapot lid.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original engravings now transformed into metallic feather-like patterns covering the owl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the owl is covered with metallic patterns that mimic feathers. These patterns are detailed and similar in material to the engravings found on the teapot in Image A, suggesting a transformation where the engravings evolved into intricate feather-like designs over the owl's body, making use of the original ornate style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been reshaped into a sharp, mechanical beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spout of what would traditionally be a teapot is reconfigured as a prominent, sharp, and mechanical-looking beak of the owl. This transformation aligns the typical spout structure with the beak shape one would expect on a bird, especially an owl, thus using the teapot's existing elements creatively.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a gracefully curved tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object includes a gracefully curved element at the rear side of the owl, resembling a tail made from the teapot's handle. The curvature and position support the interpretation that the handle now serves as a tail-like structure consistent with bird anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two glowing eyes made of cogs visible on the owl's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the owl with eyes that are distinctly glowing, and they are constructed using cogs. This feature is prominent on the face of the owl, incorporating mechanical aesthetics that align with the artistic reimagining. Such a transformation from ordinary teapot material into a creative depiction of eyes adds to the steampunk-like appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned on a richly carved wooden branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the owl in Image B on a wooden branch that shows detailed carving suggests a naturalistic and artistic setting. The branch adds context and realism to the composition, contrasted against the mechanical and metallic appearance of the owl.",
