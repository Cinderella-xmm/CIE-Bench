      "question": "Is the image vertically oriented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition of the objects within the frame and the orientation of the glass cube suggest a vertical alignment, as it fits nicely within a vertical frame without excessive empty space on the sides. This perception is supported by the proportional height of the cube relative to its width.",

      "question": "Has a traditional LEGO minifigure been added next to the pear-inspired animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, next to the pear inside the glass cube, there is a small, recognizable LEGO minifigure. This figure is characterized by its distinctive blocky shape, iconic face design, and articulated limbs, which are all common traits of traditional LEGO minifigures.",

      "question": "Does the pear-inspired animal feature a polished, seamless style with a bitten section that complements the pear's characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a pear with a bitten section but not an animal inspired by the pear. This stylized pear maintains its natural characteristics with a clean bite mark similar to Image A, but an animal representation within the cube isn't evident.",

      "question": "Are both figures enclosed within a transparent glass cube that reflects the natural wood grain look and color of the backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the pear and the LEGO minifigure are indeed placed inside a transparent glass cube. The backdrop shows hints of warm, natural wood grain tones, and these colors are subtly visible through the glass, reflecting a cohesive color representation from the wooden-like appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features lighting and background colors that mirror the warm tones from Image A. The backdrop transitions from rich caramel to a creamy shade, similar to Image A's background, enhancing the overall harmony of tones and lighting in the edited image.",
