      "question": "Is the crimson moon replaced by a circular motif made of golden threads, resembling an embroidered pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that represents the moon is depicted as a circular motif made of golden threads, closely mimicking an embroidered pattern rather than a celestial body. This appears more like a crafted object with an emphasis on texture, typical of embroidery, contrasting with the more natural representation of the moon in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-capped mountain peaks transformed into interlocking geometric shapes rather than natural mountain forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks are stylized as interlocking geometric shapes, which resemble patterns found in needlework rather than the natural, uneven contours of mountains seen in Image A. This transformation gives them a structured, organized appearance consistent with embroidery designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized embroidery patterns that mimic stitched textile designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what would be trees are represented by stylized patterns that resemble stitched textile designs. The shapes are uniform and consistent, with an obvious emphasis on texture and pattern typical of embroidery work, unlike the natural tree forms in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface of the lake rendered as silvery-blue silk strands, giving it a textile-like appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B appears to be represented by silvery-blue strands of varying shades and directions, suggesting the look of silk threads common in embroidery. This provides a textile-like quality to the water surface, in contrast to the liquid, reflective quality in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a consistent tapestry-like quality with visible threadwork, stitched textures, and a fabric-based aesthetic across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is rendered with attributes typical of embroidery, such as visible threadwork, stitched textures, and a fabric-based aesthetic. Every component, from the sky to the mountains, trees, and water, integrates these elements, giving the entire image a cohesive tapestry-like quality not observed in the photograph of Image A.",
