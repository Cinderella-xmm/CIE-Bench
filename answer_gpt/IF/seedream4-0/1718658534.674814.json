      "question": "Is the figurine made of a glossy, smooth ceramic material instead of knitted yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine has a shiny, reflective surface indicative of a glossy finish typically found in ceramic materials, unlike the texture of knitted yarn which is apparent in Image A. This shine provides a clue about the material being smooth and ceramic.",
