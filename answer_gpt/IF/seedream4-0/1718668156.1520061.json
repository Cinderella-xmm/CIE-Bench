      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tall ice tower in the foreground rendered with pixelated textures and visible circuit-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall object on the right appears pixelated and has distinct circuit-like patterns on its surface. The pixelated effect is evident due to the blocky, square-like appearance, which is characteristic of low-resolution digital graphics, while the circuit patterns resemble those typically seen in electronic designs, indicating an intentional futuristic styling.",

      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House represented using glowing neon lines instead of solid surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The representation of the Sydney Opera House in Image B is primarily through glowing neon lines. These lines outline the structure, creating a stark contrast between the vibrant neon colors and the background. The non-solid appearance gives it a digital or virtual feel, which deviates significantly from Image A, where the Opera House has solid, realistic surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves in the ocean composed of geometric shapes rather than realistic water ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean is depicted with geometric shapes, evident from the angular, repeating patterns that replace traditional, fluid-like wave forms. This differs from the realistic water ripples seen in Image A, where natural reflections and textures are visible, suggesting a deliberate artistic choice in Image B to create a digital aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the drink on the left appear as a transparent, floating hologram with visible depth and light distortion effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drink on the left does not appear as a transparent, floating hologram. Instead, it is rendered with pixelated textures similar to other elements in the image, yet it maintains a solid form without any indication of holographic effects such as transparency, floating position, or depth and light distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a unified futuristic digital aesthetic, with all elements (ice tower, Opera House, ocean, drink) transformed according to their specified styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, every element—including the tall ice tower, the neon-outlined Opera House, the geometric ocean waves, and the pixelated drink—contributes to a consistent digital aesthetic. This coherence is achieved by employing similar pixelation, neon, and geometric transformation techniques throughout the scene, establishing a unified futuristic style compared to Image A, where realistic textures and forms dominate.",
