      "question": "Have the cabinet and sink been converted into five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are seven chibi-style Russian nesting dolls visible on the edge of the bathtub. The cabinet and sink, which are present in Image A, are not present in Image B, suggesting that some elements might have been replaced or edited out. However, the context does not sufficiently support the notion that the cabinet and sink have been directly converted into nesting dolls, as it is more likely they were simply removed or replaced with a different element. Therefore, visually analyzing Image B does not confirm a conversion, and such a transformation isn't realistic or common practice.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from biggest to smallest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are displayed in a clear line-up along the edge of the bathtub, starting from the largest on the left and progressively reducing in size to the smallest on the right. This arrangement is commonly associated with Russian nesting dolls, emphasizing their graduated sizing, which follows the traditional concept of nesting dolls where each doll is smaller than the preceding one.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned along the edge of the bathtub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the nesting dolls positioned seamlessly along the edge of the bathtub, spanning from one end to the other. The dolls are arranged in a manner typical of linear presentation along the bathtub's rim, reinforcing their strategic placement in this specific area.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the aspect ratio of the edited image maintained at 3:2 horizontally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the proportions appear very typical of horizontal photographs. Given the standard width and height visible, it aligns with the 3:2 aspect ratio, a common ratio for photography that favors such compositions. This assumption is based on recognizing standard photographic proportions which match the observed dimensions of the image.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a chibi-style design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls display prominent features characteristic of chibi-style design, such as overly round faces and eyes, simplified body structures, and cute expressions. This stylistic approach is indicative of chibi design, which is popular in anime and cartoon art, and is evident in the visual representation of each doll.",
