        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting behind the wristwatch features distinctive elements commonly associated with a steampunk aesthetic, such as vintage metallic textures, intricate piping, and large vintage clocks, which are reminiscent of an old-fashioned, industrial-era train station waiting room. This contrasts with the more modern and minimalistic setting seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the original lighting and shadows on the wristwatch preserved after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the wristwatch is on a surface in a room with natural light, casting a soft shadow. In Image B, the watch maintains similar lighting and shadow patterns consistent with the ambient light coming from the side windows of the train station setting. This indicates that the lighting on the watch has been preserved despite the background change.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B showcases numerous steampunk characteristics, including intricate metallic designs, copper piping, and vintage clocks, all of which are hallmarks of the steampunk aesthetic. These elements collectively give the impression of a vintage, industrial-style train station or waiting room.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the wristwatch is placed prominently on a surface, taking a central role in the composition. Its features, such as the watch face and bracelet, are clear and undistorted, indicating that the focus and presentation of the watch have been preserved in the new background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an interior setting of a train carriage with elements like vintage lighting and large clocks indicative of a steampunk style. However, it does not explicitly show steam trains, clockwork devices, or industrial platforms. The focus is more on the interior decor and ambiance rather than specific steampunk machinery or platforms.",
