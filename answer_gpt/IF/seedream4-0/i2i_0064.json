        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that the cat is wearing a pair of glasses. This is not usual for cats, as they typically do not need or wear glasses. The glasses seem to be added to give the cat a humorous or anthropomorphic appearance. The presence of these glasses is distinct and clear, indicating they have been fitted onto the cat.",

      "question": "Is the cat lounging on a sofa in a human-like posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B is depicted sitting on a sofa with its back against the cushions and its legs extended forward, similar to how a human would sit. This is an unusual posture for a cat, which generally prefers to curl up or sit crouched. The positioning of the limbs and body suggest an intentional anthropomorphic pose.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat holding a remote control while a TV appears in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's paw is positioned on a remote control, giving the impression that the cat is holding it. Furthermore, a television is visible in the background, although not in the foreground, complementing the scene of the cat appearing to watch TV, a common human activity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows typical elements of a living room, such as furniture including a TV stand, couches, and a lamp, creating a domestic setting. This is in line with how a living room is conventionally depicted and thus confirms the scene change to a living room setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show that the cat has a clearly defined fur pattern of stripes and a bell collar around its neck. Despite its anthropomorphic pose, the natural fur pattern and the bell collar are consistent features that are likely retained from its original appearance.",
