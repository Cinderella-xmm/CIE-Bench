      "question": "Is the background now a snowy tundra landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background displays a vast expanse of snow-covered ground with icy formations and frozen terrain, typical of a tundra landscape. This observation is based on the visual cues of snow and ice which are common elements in tundra environments. The clear, blue sky further supports the idea of an open tundra landscape, contrasting with Image A's sunset surroundings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals there are no visible buildings or structures surrounding the tower, unlike in Image A where there were buildings and various elements in the background. The lack of urban structures in Image B indicates that the original elements have been removed, leaving only the snowy landscape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a ground completely covered in snow, with visible icy formations and a vast frozen landscape. These visual elements clearly indicate the presence of snow and ice, characteristic of cold, wintry conditions, unlike Image A's grassy and urban surroundings.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa in Image B maintains its iconic lean and architectural details, with no alterations in its position or appearance. This observation is made by comparing the structural features of the tower in both images, noting consistency in tilt and design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is predominantly clear and blue, indicative of daytime in a cold climate, with no hints of the vibrant orange and red hues of a sunset sky seen in Image A. This change in the sky's appearance confirms the absence of the previous sunset background.",
