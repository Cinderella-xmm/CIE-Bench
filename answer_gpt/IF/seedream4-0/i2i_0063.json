      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a horse lying down in a similar pose where the cat was in Image A. This indicates that the pose has been replicated, shifting the subject from the cat to the horse. Thus, the horse has taken on the original pose from Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows dilapidated buildings, rubble, and an abandoned environment that is typical of a post-apocalyptic setting. The visual cues such as broken structures and overgrown areas contribute to the feeling of a city that has been decayed and deserted.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is overlaid with the text 'LAST RIDE' at the top. The overall color scheme of the image has a cool, blue-tinted filter applied to it, affecting both the text and the entire image, which sets a somber mood consistent with the theme.",
