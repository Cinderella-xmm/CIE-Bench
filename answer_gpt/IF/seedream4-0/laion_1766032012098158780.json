      "question": "Has the jeans been transformed into a perfume bottle shape that maintains the flared leg silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an object that is clearly shaped like a pair of jeans but has been transformed into a perfume bottle. The silhouette notably maintains the flared leg style, which is characteristic of the jeans design commonly referred to as bell-bottom or flared jeans. The flared shape is distinct and visible, combining the features of jeans and a bottle.",

      "question": "Is the bottle made of transparent glass tinted with denim blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle retains a distinct denim blue color, consistent with that of blue jeans. The glass appears to be transparent due to the reflective surfaces and the visible edges characteristic of glass material, yet it is tinted with a denim blue color, giving it the appearance of jeans while maintaining the transparency typical of glass bottles.",

      "question": "Have the back pockets been replaced with embossed metallic branding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the two back pockets of the jeans have text designed on them that appears metallic and embossed, as it reflects light in a way typical of metallic surfaces. The branding 'Iianu' on each pocket replaces the typical back pocket stitching or labeling, suggesting that the original pocket design has been altered to include these embossed metallic elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a silver button-style cap at the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the jeans-shaped bottle in Image B, there is a cap that resembles the appearance of a button, largely silver in color. Its design is typical of perfume bottle caps, providing more functionality as a stopper for the bottle than a button on clothing, and its placement at the top signifies its role as a cap.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are lace-up details present along the side of the bottle, matching the position of the original jeans' laces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals a lace-up detail running down one side of the bottle, reminiscent of the lace-up design traditionally found on jeans, especially those with stylistic side lacing. Comparing with Image A, the positioning of these laces on the side matches with how laces would typically be positioned on a pair of jeans, indicating they are intended to stay true to the original jeansâ€™ design.",
