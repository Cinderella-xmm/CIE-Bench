      "question": "Does the house appear as a sentient, mythical treehouse creature rather than a conventional dwelling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house is transformed significantly with an imaginative theme. It features a large eye at the top, with branches and vines extending from it, giving it a mythical creature-like appearance. This stands in contrast to the conventional dwelling seen in Image A, which is a typical straw-roofed structure. The visual elements, such as the eye and the overgrowth of branches, contribute to the house appearing sentient and mythical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns replaced with detailed, leg-like wooden structures resembling limbs or roots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the support columns have been creatively altered to resemble large, limb-like or root formations, which contrast with the simple, straight support columns in Image A. These alterations give the structure a more organic and creature-like quality, aligning with the mythical theme.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the straw roof been replaced by an overgrowth of realistic leafy branches forming a natural canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a straw roof, there is a significant overgrowth of branches and leaves that form a natural canopy. This change transforms the roof, making it look like part of a tree, and gives the structure a more organic, cohesive appearance as part of the mythical treehouse creature theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish transformed into a large, lidless eye with visible iris and pupil features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue of a large eye is prominently where the satellite dish was located in Image A. This eye is detailed with a visible iris and pupil, replacing the conventional appearance of a satellite dish, and contributes to the sentient, mythical creature theme.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the exterior walls fully covered with detailed, textured patterns resembling natural tree bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the structure's exterior still hints at some wooden textures, the walls are more characterized by a bamboo-like appearance, intermixed with vines and branches rather than fully covered tree bark patterns. This structure helps maintain its tree-like identity but doesn't completely cover all surfaces with bark patterns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange blossoms are depicted with a subtle glow or aura, which adds to the fantasy element of the scene. This glowing effect is not present in Image A, where the flowers have a more standard appearance, contributing further to the mystical theme in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there long, trailing vines descending from the treehouse, giving it an organic, flowing appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that there are multiple long vines trailing down from the structure, which give it a flowing, organic appearance. This is a significant transformation compared to Image A, which does not have such vine-like features. The presence of these vines enhances the natural, treehouse aesthetic.",
