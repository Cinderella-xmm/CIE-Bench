      "question": "Has the backpack's fabric been replaced with a visible rugged leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible surface of the backpack has a shiny, smooth appearance characteristic of leather, particularly a rugged leather. This is a stark contrast to Image A, which shows a fabric texture without any shine. The distinctive leather look in Image B indicates a texture that is typical of rugged leather, replacing the fabric seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buckles appear darker and have a more muted, vintage look which is associated with an antique brass finish. In contrast, Image A shows reflective, bright buckles which are indicative of a metallic silver color very typical of more modern finishes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible patches on the side panels of the backpack that show designs and colors often seen in vintage-style travel patches. Analyzing Image A, these patches are absent, indicating their addition in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' is prominently displayed on the front flap of the backpack in a stylized font that blends with the vintage theme. Image A does not have any such text, showing a plain flap instead.",
