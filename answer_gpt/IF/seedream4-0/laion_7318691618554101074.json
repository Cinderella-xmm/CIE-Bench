      "question": "Are all makeup brushes replaced with sculpted crystal wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects inside the container appear to be stylized crystal wands rather than traditional makeup brushes. The wands have a clear, crystalline appearance, which is distinct from the bristled and opaque visual of makeup brushes typically found. This matches the description of sculpted crystal wands.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does each crystal wand have a unique gemstone at its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three crystal wands visible, each topped with a different colored gemstone: one is blue, another green, and the last one is purple. This indicates that each wand has a unique gemstone at its tip distinct enough to be individually identified by color.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the container a transparent crystal vase with visible etched floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The container in Image B is made of transparent material, and visible engraved designs resemble floral patterns. This indicates that the container is a crystal vase with etched floral patterns, as observed from its texture and transparency.",

      "question": "Has the lace band been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a decorative element around the middle of the vase that appears to be crafted from the same clear material as the wands, suggesting a carved crystal appearance rather than fabric lace. This implies that the lace band has been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface on which the vase is placed appears to be reflective, showing a mirrored image of the vase and parts of the wands. This indicates that it is indeed an arrangement on a mirrored surface, as denoted by these reflections.",
