      "question": "Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are six distinct magnets shown. These represent various elements: a blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, and bangles. However, there is no separate illustration explicitly depicting the background wall pattern as an individual element among these magnets. Based on the given options, the answer must be No, as the background is not a separate chibi-style illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all six magnets exhibit a vibrant, glossy surface with visible reflections or shine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnets show consistent glossy surfaces with bright colors and clear shine that enhance their visual appeal. The reflections on these magnets suggest a glossy finish common in manufactured collectibles. Therefore, the shiny appearance is prominently displayed in all six magnets.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Do all six magnets have clearly rounded edges instead of sharp corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The magnets in Image B, including all the chibi illustrations, show rounded edges typical of safe and child-friendly designs in collectibles. There are no sharp corners visible, contributing to a softer and more playful appearance characteristic of the chibi art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the six magnets accurately depict one of the following: the embellished purple blouse, the intricate lehenga with floral patterns, the red dupatta, the traditional jewelry, the silver bangles, or the ornate background wall pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnets depict elements such as an embellished purple blouse, a lehenga, a red dupatta, traditional jewelry, and silver bangles. However, the ornate background wall pattern is not specifically depicted as a separate magnet. Since one of the elements is missing in the magnets, the answer is No.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnets showcase a chibi art style with characters featuring large heads and simplified facial features, a common characteristic of chibi artwork that emphasizes cuteness and simplicity. This art style is consistent across all magnets shown in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits six magnets arranged individually, with each one standing alone showcasing distinct elements. This arrangement is typical of a collectible set where each piece is separate and unique, suggesting they are intended for individual collection rather than as parts of a single image.",
