      "question": "Are bold ink outlines visible around all major elements of the car and scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style resembles that of a comic or illustration, where bold outlines are typically used to define the shapes and details distinctly. This technique is evident around the major elements of the car and the overall scene, emphasizing the contours in a stylized manner typical of comic art. These heavy ink lines help enhance the cartoonish effect and make each element stand out clearly.",

      "question": "Is halftone dot shading applied to at least one surface of the car or background to create texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone dot shading is a common technique used in comic book illustrations to create texture and depth, using dots of varying sizes and densities. In Image B, this effect is noticeable on parts of the car and background, giving a textured appearance that contrasts with the otherwise flat colors. This enhances the comic-style aesthetic by adding visual interest and depth.",

      "question": "Are all visible colors limited to cream, muted orange, and deep gray without any additional hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a simplified color palette that consists predominantly of cream, muted orange, and deep gray. These particular colors are used to create a cohesive and stylized look, common in certain types of comic or retro illustrations, where a limited palette can enhance the visual impact and thematic tone. No additional hues are apparent, as the palette remains consistent throughout the image.",

      "question": "Are motion lines present around the car to indicate skidding or rapid movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comic-style illustrations, motion lines are often employed to convey movement and action, especially in scenes depicting speed or dynamic motion, such as with a race car. In Image B, these lines are visible around the wheels and the car body, suggesting the skidding and rapid movement, enhancing the sense of speed and dynamic action in the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble above the car containing an action word like “VROOM!” in comic-style lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a speech bubble above the car containing the word 'VROOM!' in bold, comic-style lettering. This is a classic element of comic book imagery, where onomatopoeic words are used to audibly express actions and sounds occurring in the scene. This element adds to the dynamic and illustrative nature of the image, reinforcing the theme of speed and action.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the background been simplified to remove detailed elements such as spectators and fencing, focusing only on motion and basic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the two images, Image A features a detailed background with spectators and fencing, while in Image B, the background has been simplified significantly. The focus is shifted away from the detailed elements to emphasize motion and the immediate environment around the car. This simplification is common in comic art to maintain focus on the main action without distractions, capturing the essence of movement and scene dynamics.",
