      "question": "Is the capybara's body rendered as a polished bronze metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible parts surrounding the blurred face appear to be composed of a bronze material due to the shiny and metallic texture typical of bronze sculptures. The body seems to be entirely crafted from this material, including the parts visible over the blurred area. Generally, polished bronze surfaces exhibit a metallic sheen, which is evident in this image.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portion above the blurred area is part of what appears to be a bronze structure with ornamental details like patterns and contours consistent with those typically found on helmets.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible part surrounding the blurred face, which might include components like the eyes or items related to the head, does not provide evidence of sunglasses composed of glass lenses and bronze frames in Image B.
