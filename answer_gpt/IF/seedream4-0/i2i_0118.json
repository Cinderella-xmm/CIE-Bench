        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with a full-body view, visible from head to feet, which indicates it is not in a half-body form. The character is shown as if it is emerging from a surface, showcasing its entire form rather than just the upper half. Therefore, based on the complete visibility of the character’s body, the answer is drawn.",

      "question": "Does the character appear to be jumping out of a children’s tablet screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is positioned above a tablet screen with its legs bent and arms raised, giving the impression of motion as if it's leaping off the screen. There is a light burst effect on the screen, enhancing the illusion that the character is emerging from it. This setup, combined with the visual effects, suggests an interactive and dynamic movement of jumping out of the tablet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s arms are raised and slightly spread apart, which can be interpreted as a welcoming gesture. The position is typical of an open and friendly stance, often used to greet or invite interaction. This conclusion is based on the common understanding of body language where open arms signify welcome or excitement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character emerging from a tablet, which is a classic visual way to depict interaction between digital and physical worlds. The burst of light adds to the dramatic effect of an object moving between realms, often used to simulate an interactive or augmented reality experience. This makes the viewer perceive the action as if the character is interacting with the physical environment, a typical trait of interactive entertainment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tablet is depicted with a screen displaying colorful graphics reminiscent of children's games, and it has a rounded edge which is a common safety feature in tablets designed for younger users. The presence of bright colors and playful imagery on the screen implies the design is tailored for a child's audience.",
