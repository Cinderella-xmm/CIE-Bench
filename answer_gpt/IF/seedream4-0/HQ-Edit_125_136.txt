    "Question": "Q1: Is the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, I examined the entirety of the scene for any text that serves as a title. The image primarily illustrates an astronaut on the Moon surface with Earth and a space station visible, but it lacks any text identifiable as a title like “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics.” Thus, there is no evident title text in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects including the astronaut, Moon, and ISS are represented with smooth, clean lines and consistent colors typical of vector-style artworks, lacking fine and realistic details. This indicates a non-photorealistic, simplified depiction commonly used in diagrams or educational illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the spacesuit include visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the spacesuit of the astronaut lacks intricate detailing like stitching or fabric patterns. It is depicted in a simplified form with smooth areas of color that do not showcase any realistic textures, keeping consistent with a vector-style illustration.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are gold accents used in the image to emphasize certain elements such as labels, borders, or arrows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are gold-toned accents evident, particularly on the components of the space station and arrows. These gold accents serve to add emphasis and visual interest to particular areas like the edges and joints, which is common in illustrations to create a focused contrast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there three sequential stages illustrated with arrows showing the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays three sequential stages depicted at the bottom as 'Step 1: Prepare', 'Step 2: Navigate', and 'Step 3: Operate', with arrows pointing from one phrase to the next, subtly suggesting progression or stages of interaction though not directly indicating movement towards the space station.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the labels “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, and “Step 3: Operate” displayed in sequence along the bottom of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly labels three phrases at the bottom which are 'Step 1: Prepare', 'Step 2: Navigate', and 'Step 3: Operate'. They are arranged in sequential order from left to right, depicting a linear progression or sequence of actions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the entire infographic arranged in a vertical format with elements stacked from top to bottom?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement involves horizontal organization of text and elements rather than purely vertical stacking. The astronaut, space station, and Earth are arranged to fill out most of the image with linear stage titles positioned horizontally at the bottom, reflecting a more balanced layout rather than a strictly vertical orientation.",
    "answer": "No"
