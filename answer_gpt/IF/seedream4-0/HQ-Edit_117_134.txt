    "Question": "Q1: Is the grand piano replaced with a cookie sculpture that retains the same overall shape and structure as the original piano?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, it's evident that the grand piano is not retained but instead replaced with a cookie sculpture. The sculpture itself resembles an ornate structure with decorative elements not coherent with a piano, deviating from the overall shape and structure of a grand piano. This assessment was derived by observing the second image's visual elements compared to common grand piano features.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the surface of the piano sculpture uniformly colored in a rich caramel hue instead of glossy black?",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the piano keys made of embedded sugar crystals rather than solid black or white material?",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the cookie piano positioned on a plain white marble tabletop, devoid of any surrounding stage, audience, or theater elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie sculpture is indeed placed on a white marble tabletop. However, the surrounding environment still displays theater elements, such as the chandelier and the ornate balcony seats, reflecting its thematic setting and invalidating the description of being devoid of those elements.",
