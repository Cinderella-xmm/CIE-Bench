      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog is simplified into a cartoon-like form, which is a hallmark of chibi style. Chibi style often involves small, rounded, and simplified features to enhance cuteness, such as a large head compared to the body, and minimalistic facial features. The dog appears with a simplified, rounded body and closed eyes, which aligns with the chibi style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements such as the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag are designed with simple lines and solid colors, lacking any gradients or shadows that would suggest depth. This flat design is characteristic of minimalist illustrations, which use basic shapes and colors to convey objects without intricate details.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the black dog is a significant element, the illustration seems to balance attention among all the objects equally due to its minimalist style. The dog's characteristics are stylized rather than distinctively detailed, thus not making it the most prominent element compared to other objects like the bench, radio, and trash bag.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the illustration incorporate a bold white outline around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire composition, including the bench, dog, radio, juice box, and trash bag, is surrounded by a thick, bold white outline. This is a common stylistic choice in sticker designs, helping to separate the illustration from the background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog and bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame of the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog, bench, and other items stay entirely within the boundary of the circle created by the white outline. Therefore, they do not extend beyond the circle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the illustration transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the areas around the objects within the circular frame are blank, indicating that there is no filled background color or pattern. This suggests that the background of the illustration is meant to be transparent, which is further suggested by the checkerboard pattern visible, typical of denoting transparency in digital images.",
