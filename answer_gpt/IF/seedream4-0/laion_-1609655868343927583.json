      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B shows that the drawers are still present and resemble traditional cabinet drawers instead of openable pouches. They have not been transformed into adventurer-style gear, which would require a distinct change in form and function inconsistent with visible drawers.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts an anthropomorphic figure with features such as a crown, patterned robe, and clawed feet, all of which are stylistic transformations derived from the original cabinet structure. The artistic modifications integrate these elements into a cohesive figure standing upright, differentiating it from the original cabinet form.",
      "weight": 1,

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the materials used, such as the crown with gemstones, the robe-like fabric, a metallic belt, and details on the feet, align with royal attire. These transformations showcase textures and materials consistent with themes of royalty, integrating fabric and adorned metal details that suggest royal rather than adventurer influences.",
