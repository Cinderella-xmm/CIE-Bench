      "question": "Has the dog been converted into a chibi-style blind box figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoonish, stylized version of the dog rendered in a chibi form, characterized by an oversized head, large eyes, and simplified body proportions indicative of chibi-style blind box figures. Commonly, these figures resemble toys with unrealistic proportions to enhance cuteness.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dogâ€™s body still in the prone, ball-focused pose after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure of the dog is positioned lying on its stomach with its face directly facing a tennis ball, similar to a prone position focused on the ball. The simplified posture retains the central theme of a ball-focused pose.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the dog's head been enlarged slightly compared to its original size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi-style figure features a disproportionately large head compared to the body, which is a common stylistic trait intended to convey cuteness in such figures. This contrasts with Image A where the dog's proportions are realistic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball placed so that it touches the dog's nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is positioned directly in front of and touching the nose of the chibi-style dog, emphasizing the toy's interaction with the ball. Image A shows the ball near the dog's nose also, indicating a similar positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base feature a relief tennis ball pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a green base under the chibi figure of the dog, which displays faint patterns resembling tennis balls as a relief design. This decorative choice connects to the original context of tennis balls shown in Image A.",
