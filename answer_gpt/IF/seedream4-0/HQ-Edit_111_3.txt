These are typical features of an infographic, aimed at educating the viewer on a specific topic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?",
    "explanation": "The title 'Butterfly Biology Basics' is prominently positioned at the top of Image B, representing the primary subject of the infographic. This placement is standard for titles within such layouts, ensuring it is immediately noticeable to viewers.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there text boxes in the image that explain the butterfly’s role in pollination?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains text boxes with information placed near the butterfly. While the exact content is illegible, the presence of these text boxes in an educational infographic format suggests they would include information on topics relevant to butterfly biology, such as pollination.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the overall visual style delicate, with the butterfly’s vibrant blue color clearly emphasized as the central focal point?",
    "explanation": "Image B, even with the overlay of the monochrome diagram and labels, maintains a delicate and aesthetically pleasing style. However, the vibrant blue of the original butterfly in Image A is mostly obscured by the line drawing, indicating that the color is not emphasized.",
