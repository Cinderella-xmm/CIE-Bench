        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals have been transformed into stylized characters that embody the characteristics of a chibi-style 3D model.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual in the back is still positioned near a softly glowing lamp, which is placed on a table. This setup recreates the original scene's composition, further enhanced by the warm lighting surrounding the lamp.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a chibi-style 3D model with a more artistic and stylized representation, moving away from the photorealism seen in Image A. However, the lighting maintains its warm quality, as evidenced by the glow around the lamp, but the overall scene is less realistic due to the stylistic transformation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a border that resembles a photo frame around the entire composition, suggesting that the scene is enclosed in a frame. This is a distinct addition in the edited image compared to Image A.",
