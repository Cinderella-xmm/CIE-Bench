      "question": "Does the edited image display a visual texture consistent with satin paper, including a soft sheen and slight reflectivity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface appearance around the watercolor painting seems smooth and slightly shiny, indicative of satin paper. Satin paper is known for its glossy finish that offers a soft reflection. The visual cues from the watercolor effect and the glossiness of the page support this analysis.",
