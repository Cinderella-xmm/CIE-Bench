      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the Sphinx is accompanied by a radiant sun disc with visible hieroglyphic patterns surrounding it.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Sphinx in Image B is positioned similarly to Image A in relation to the background elements like the pyramid and the setting sun.
