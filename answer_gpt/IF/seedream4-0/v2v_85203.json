      "question": "Does the butterfly appear as a dynamic vortex of swirling cerulean and indigo energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a swirling formation of cerulean and indigo energy that resembles a vortex. This formation is depicted as a powerful and dynamic swirling mass in contrast to a calm butterfly. Commonly, butterflies are static in images, while swirling patterns indicate movement and energy. Therefore, Image B's subject is not depicted as a typical butterfly but rather as an energy vortex.",

      "question": "Are there faint trails of light emanating from the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a swirling energy vortex with distinct bright, wing-like formations extending from the sides. These formations appear to be trails of light or energy, contributing to the dynamic energy theme of the image. Although these are not literal butterfly wings, they emanate from the edges of the vortex, suggesting trails of light.",

      "question": "Does the dark lower mass resemble a chasm of fractured, glossy obsidian?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower part of Image B depicts a dark area that appears fractured and glossy, resembling the characteristics of obsidian. Obsidian is known for its shiny, glass-like appearance and is often depicted in art as having deep black, reflective surfaces. The image clearly showcases these features, indicating a fractured, glossy chasm.",

      "question": "Is the entire image enveloped in a mystical, nebulous atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a misty or nebulous atmosphere surrounds the vortex and the chasm-like formations. This gives the entire scene a mystical vibe, often seen in fantasy art. The fog-like elements and swirling energy enhance this perception, suggesting that the entire image is enveloped in a nebulous, mystical atmosphere.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly clearly depicted as hovering above the dark lower mass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B is not of a traditional butterfly but rather a vortex with energetic, light-like wings. It is centered in the image rather than hovering. The formation depicts an abstract energy entity, not a butterfly hovering above a surface. Thus, there is no clear depiction of a butterfly hovering above the dark lower mass.",
