      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible reflective surface above the sink, which is typically indicative of a mirror. Instead, there is a rectangular object that looks more like a piece of wall art with a painted landscape on it. Knowing that mirrors are typically designed to reflect and the object in Image B doesn't exhibit these properties, it can be concluded that the mirror is no longer present.",

      "question": "Has the area previously occupied by the mirror been replaced with a minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space above the sink features an artwork that depicts a simple, stylized landscape with minimal colors and elements. Such characteristics align with minimalist art. In contrast, mirrors usually have a reflective surface, which is absent here. This suggests that the mirror was replaced by a minimalist landscape wall art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the minimalist landscape wall art appear to have a fabric canvas material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork in Image B displays a texture consistent with that of fabric canvas, evident from the subtle cross-hatching or fibrous appearance visible upon close inspection. This visual detail, combined with a common understanding of what fabric canvas textures look like, indicates that the art piece is likely printed or painted on canvas.",

      "question": "Have any other parts of the bathroom, such as the sink, vase, lights, or tiles, been altered unintentionally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B are examined, focusing on the sink, vase, lights, and tiles. Both images display identical features in these areas: the sink is the same, the vase with flowers remains untouched, the lighting fixtures are consistent, and the wall tiles haven't changed. Since there are no noticeable changes or alterations in these items, it's concluded that no other parts of the bathroom were altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any additional elements or changes in the image beyond removing the mirror and replacing it with a minimalist landscape wall art on a fabric canvas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image A and Image B, the principal alteration is the replacement of the mirror with the wall art. The rest of the scene, including the sink, cabinet, light fixtures, vase, and wall tiles, remains consistent in both images. There are no additional visual differences or elements introduced other than the described change.",
