      "question": "Is the background showing an African savanna scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape features flat, open grasslands with sparse tree coverage, typically seen in an African savanna. The lone acacia tree, a tree commonly found in the African savanna, further supports this identification. Combining these visual cues with common geographic knowledge confirms the setting as an African savanna.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dark sky filled with stars and the Milky Way, which are typically visible during nighttime. The absence of sunlight and the darkness of the sky visually indicate it is night.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B prominently displays a bright, dense band of stars stretching across it, characteristic of the Milky Way. Such celestial patterns are distinctive and easily identifiable, affirming the presence of the Milky Way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are multiple stars visible alongside the Milky Way in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, besides the bright Milky Way, numerous individual stars are scattered across the sky, contributing to the overall night-sky appearance. This confirms that multiple stars are visible alongside the Milky Way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the train and railway tracks appear seamlessly integrated into the savanna background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "While Image B attempts to place the train and railway tracks within the savanna setting, there are notable discrepancies. The lighting and shading of the train, particularly its shadow, do not fully correspond with the lighting conditions expected in a nighttime savanna scene, suggesting a degree of incongruence.",
