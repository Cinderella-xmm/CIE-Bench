    "Question": "Q3: Are the marquee signs for 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' rendered using smooth red flat LEGO bricks to form the letters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the marquee signs for 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' are represented with red LEGO bricks. However, the letters for these signs appear to be printed or designed on the bricks rather than constructed using flat LEGO bricks specifically to form letters. Thus, the signage resembles LEGO components but doesn't use smooth LEGO bricks to create each letter individually, but rather displays printed or etched lettering on red LEGO elements.",
