      "question": "Is the entire forest lake scene enclosed within a visible spherical glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the image clearly shows a spherical glass orb containing a miniature version of the forest lake scene. The orb refracts light and has a glossy surface characteristic of glass, enclosing a portion of the landscape, including the lake and trees, mimicking the features seen outside the orb with a focus on specific elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, inside the spherical glass orb, the ducks appear to be different from those in the lake outside the orb. They have a smooth, glossy, and reflective surface, indicative of 3D models or crafted figurines, offering a synthetic look distinct from the more natural appearance of real ducks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water within the orb in Image B appears exceptionally clear and layered, exhibiting properties similar to resin art, where textures and transparency enhance depth perception. This gives a sense of realism and artistic clarity, distinct from the natural look outside the orb, suggesting an artificial enhancement to mimic depth and clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible miniature figurines of woodland animals placed among the rocks and vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small figurines within the glass orb, including a deer among the trees and a raccoon-like animal near the base of the vegetation. The presence of these small model replicas suggests a crafted scene including woodland animal figures, enhancing the diorama-like effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass orb resting on a natural wood base with visible organic textures such as grain or bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the glass orb in Image B, there is a circular wood base with visible grain patterns and possibly even remnants of bark, consistent with naturally textured wood. This detail matches the presence of a crafted element where natural materials are used to augment the orb's display.",
