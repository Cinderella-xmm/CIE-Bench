      "question": "Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bears are depicted as mosaic figurines. This effect is achieved by using small, colorful tiles arranged in a way that maintains the shape and features of the teddy bears. The tiles are organized to closely resemble the texture that would mimic a fur-like appearance in a stylized manner, commonly seen in mosaic art techniques. This can be discerned by observing the consistent arrangement of tiles over the bears' surface, giving them a textured look similar to how fur would be translated into a mosaic format.",

      "question": "Have the knitted sweaters been replaced with intricate tile patterns in yellow and turquoise hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original knitted sweaters from Image A are transformed into intricate tile patterns. The colors of the sweaters remain yellow and turquoise, but instead of the yarn texture of knitwear, we see the sweaters depicted using carefully arranged tiles. This creates a pattern that simulates the texture and appearance of the sweaters by using the same hues, but in a more rigid, geometric format characteristic of mosaic artwork.",

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, snout) recreated using subtly shaded tiles to provide detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the teddy bears in Image B are crafted using tiles that vary slightly in color and size to achieve the necessary detail. The eyes, nose, mouth, and snout are emphasized by subtle shading and color variations within the tiles, allowing these features to stand out while staying cohesive with the overall mosaic design. This technique ensures that the details of the original features are translated into the mosaic medium effectively.",

      "question": "Do the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles that contrast with the mosaic texture of the rest of the bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows of the teddy bears are depicted using tiles, but they have a distinct difference from the rest of the mosaic texture. The bows appear to be made of larger, glossy, and smooth tiles, which contrast with the smaller, matte tiles used for the rest of the bears' bodies. This glossy finish gives the bows a shiny appearance, making them visually distinct and creating a contrast in texture.",

      "question": "Are the mosaic bears positioned on a minimalistic white pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teddy bears resting on a plain, white pedestal. This pedestal is minimalist in design, providing a clean and simple base that highlights the detailed mosaic work of the bears. The stark white color and smooth texture of the pedestal create a visual separation between the complex patterns of the mosaic bears and the simplicity of the pedestal, enhancing the overall presentation of the artwork.",
