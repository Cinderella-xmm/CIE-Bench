    "Question": "Q1: Is the wall clock still visible after the edit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, which is the edited image, the setting has dramatically changed to what appears to be a castle hall interior with stone walls and arches, indicative of a historical or medieval style.

    "Question": "Q4: Does the lighting in the edited image match the lighting style from the original image, with similar shadows and highlights?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B showcases large, natural light entering through what appear to be tall windows or arches, producing long shadows on the large open floor. This differs from Image A, which shows direct sunlight casting more angular shadows within a smaller domestic space. The style and effect of lighting are adapted to their respective different environments and thus do not match.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Are there any remaining objects from the original scene, such as vases or plants, in the castle hall setting?",
