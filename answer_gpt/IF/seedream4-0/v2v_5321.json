      "question": "Does the image exhibit a hand-sculpted claymation style with visible textures and a three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) has a distinct claymation style, which manifests in the textured surfaces and the handcrafted appearance of the character's costume and accessories, making it look three-dimensional. This can be recognized by the visible textures and contours that give the character a sculpted look, common in claymation where elements appear tactile and solid.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes on the character's costume clearly defined and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the character's costume are part of the claymation style and are therefore slightly exaggerated and defined in a chunky manner typical of claymation. They stand out more visually due to the material effect, compared to stitched or printed fabric in traditional imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character's beret clearly visible and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beret in Image B can be identified as part of the claymation style because it appears to be molded with clear visible texture, characteristic of sculpted clay. This emphasizes its presence through its pronounced three-dimensional form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background maintain the European rooftop setting, with architectural details adapted to the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background retains the European rooftop setting, but with claymation adaptation, the rooftops and buildings possess a crafted, textured look. The flatter and more compact aesthetic typical of clay architecture is evident, maintaining the original setting's essence while converting it into a claymation style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirety of Image B, from the character to the background, is depicted in a coherent claymation style. The character and architectural elements all exhibit the hand-sculpted look with visible texturing and three-dimensional structure consistent throughout the scene.",
