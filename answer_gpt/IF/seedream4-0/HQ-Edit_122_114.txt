    "Question": "Q1: Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stork's body exhibits a distinct metallic appearance, with what looks like segmented or riveted metal plates instead of natural feathers. This conclusion is drawn from the shiny texture and uniform, fabricated look, typical of metallic surfaces, visually implying that the feathers have been replaced with metal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the nest retains some natural twig elements, it is prominently integrated with multiple cogs and gears. These mechanical parts are substantial and distributed throughout the nest, creating a strong visual impact. The conclusion is derived from observing the mechanical parts distinctly intertwined with twigs, indicating they are a significant component of the nest.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible copper-colored pipes running along the roof's edge and integrated with the overall design. These elements have an industrial appearance and shine typical of copper piping, suggesting an intentional design integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stork is depicted with visible mechanical joints, notably around its legs and wings. These joints are clearly articulated and possess a mechanical, engineered look, which suggests a design different from natural bird bone structures. This observation leads to the conclusion that the stork's joints are indeed mechanical.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a cohesive Steampunk aesthetic throughout, characterized by the use of metallic textures like the stork's metal plates, the intricate gears in the nest, and the copper pipes on the house. These elements collectively contribute to the distinct Steampunk style, which is a fusion of Victorian design with industrial mechanical components.",
    "answer": "Yes"
