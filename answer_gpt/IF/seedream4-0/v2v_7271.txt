    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene, including the laundromat and the person holding laundry, depicted using Lego bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, every aspect of the scene, from the exterior of the laundromat to the person and the folded laundry, exhibits the distinctive appearance of Lego bricks. The walls, the person, and the laundry all have the interlocking brick texture and shapes associated with Lego. This indicates that the entire scene is constructed with Lego bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the scene have a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama?",
    "explanation": "The scene in Image B has a static, built appearance due to being entirely made from Lego bricks. The structured and unchanging nature of the Lego construction aligns with the characteristics of a stop-motion diorama, where each component is deliberately placed to create a coherent scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Has the overall scene composition been maintained while adapting it to the Lego aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, while the medium of representation is different, the overall scene composition is preserved. Both images depict a laundromat setting with a person holding folded laundry in front. Despite the transformation into the Lego aesthetic, the main elements and layout are consistent between the two images, demonstrating that the composition has been maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
