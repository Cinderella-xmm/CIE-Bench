      "question": "Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft appears to be encased in a display case, which is indicative of a 3D model rather than a real-life scene. The use of lighting, shadows, and the overall composition suggests a stylized approach rather than photorealism which typically attempts to replicate real-world visuals more precisely.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the display case in Image B, elements resembling clouds are positioned at the base, serving as part of the decorative arrangement to simulate flight or elevation for the aircraft model.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The propellers of the aircraft in Image B exhibit motion blur, indicative of spinning, achieved through the visual effects applied in the rendering of the model, simulating rotation.",
