      "question": "Has the black bottle cap been replaced with a transparent or translucent glass stopper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle cap appears to be replaced by a transparent glass stopper. This can be inferred from the visibility of the neck of the bottle through the material, suggesting a change from the opaque black cap in Image A to a clear or translucent glass material. The design aligns with what is usually expected of fragrance diffusers, where a glass stopper is common.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label has a predominant color scheme of emerald green and gold. This contrasts with the label in Image A, which has more yellow and orange tones.
