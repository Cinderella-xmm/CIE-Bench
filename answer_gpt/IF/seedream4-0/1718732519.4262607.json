      "question": "Is the hot dog replaced with a model made of red, yellow, and tan LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a hot dog is composed of LEGO bricks. The colors of the bricks are clearly red, yellow, and tan, which are commonly used colors in LEGO sets. This transformation from an actual hot dog to a LEGO model is evident in the structure composed entirely of these interlocking toy blocks.",

      "question": "Has the original bottle been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is substituted with an object that appears to be a vase-like ceramic item covered in a mosaic pattern. This pattern consists of small geometric shapes in various colors, distinctly different from the plain surface of the original bottle in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic-style ceramic object in Image B displays an array of geometric patterns. The predominant colors used in these patterns are red, yellow, and tan, creating a vivid and visually striking mosaic design on the object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic piece placed on a smooth wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic piece are situated on a flat wooden board. The wood's texture is smooth and polished, providing a stable base for the display of these two objects.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO hot dog maintain an elongated, cylindrical shape similar to a real hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO hot dog in Image B is constructed to mimic the elongated, cylindrical shape typical of a traditional hot dog. The linear arrangement of LEGO bricks effectively replicates this classic hot dog form despite being constructed from toy blocks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece have a rounded, artistic form rather than a realistic bottle shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic ceramic object in Image B exhibits a rounded, artistic form more akin to a vase rather than the bottle shape in Image A. The structure appears bulbous and rounded, diverging from the vertical, cylindrical form of a standard bottle.",
