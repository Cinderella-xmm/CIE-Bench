      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains two distinct views: a top-down view on the left side and an angled side view on the right side.

In Image B, the top-down view and angled side view depict these elements accurately. The diagram aligns with the layout seen from above, and the angled view resembles the structure and design of the original setup.",
