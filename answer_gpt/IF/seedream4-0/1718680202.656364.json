      "question": "Is the title \"A Capybara’s Sydney Escape\" displayed prominently on the image, arching above the Opera House?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'A Capybara's Sydney Escape' is clearly shown in a arching fashion across the top part of the image. The positioning of the text suggests an intention for prominence, drawing attention as it is large and centered near the top. It is positioned above the Opera House, which further ensures it is a focal point. There is no need to compare with Image A as this question pertains solely to Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image combine photorealistic rendering of the capybara and environment with illustrated or stylized elements (e.g., exaggerated features, cartoon-like details)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a blend of both realistic and cartoon-like elements. The capybara's depiction is particularly photorealistic with detailed textures and lighting, akin to real-life photography. However, stylized elements are incorporated through the cartoonish stickers added to its clothing and added graphic designs on the beverage. These illustrate additional artistic interpretations beyond realism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font used for the text 'A Capybara's Sydney Escape' appears in a bold and playful manner, characterized by its thick, rounded edges which convey a sense of fun and lightheartedness. The arching of the text above the Sydney Opera House accentuates its prominence, following a visual style that aligns with whimsical themes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the blues are more vivid and saturated in Image B compared to Image A, a direct visual comparison is necessary. In Image A, the beanie and drink exhibit more muted and natural tones. In Image B, the saturation levels of the blue beanie and the blues within the beverage are increased, giving them a more vibrant appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible cartoonish beach-themed stickers on the capybara’s attire but none on the blue beanie itself. The stickers are distributed across the sweater and feature various playful illustrations. Image A, for comparison, lacks these additional elements entirely.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Sydney Opera House in Image B is distinctly visible, retaining its iconic architectural design and orientation as seen in images capturing its shape alongside the waterfront and the sky. Image A also features the Opera House in a similar context, confirming its clarity and continued positioning.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
