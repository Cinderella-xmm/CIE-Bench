      "question": "Is the leaf enclosed within a transparent spherical container resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf appears to be inside a clear spherical object with a stand, resembling a snow globe. The transparent nature of the sphere and the central placement of the leaf inside it suggests this alignment. By combining world knowledge of typical snow globes, which are often spherical and can contain various objects inside, it is reasonable to deduce that the leaf is indeed enclosed within a container like a snow globe.",

      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a surface resembling a tabletop near a window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe resting on a flat surface, which can be reasonably interpreted as a tabletop. The presence of a window in the background, with visible sunlight filtering through, suggests that the snow globe is indeed near a window. This can be deduced by recognizable visual elements of a typical indoor setting where tabletop sighting near windows is common.",

      "question": "Is the background softly blurred and contains warm tones such as orange or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background beyond the snow globe is visibly blurred, contributing to a depth of field effect common in photography. This soft blur, combined with the evident presence of warm colors like orange or yellow, contributes to a cozy and inviting aesthetic, which is often sought after in visual compositions that aim to invoke warmth or comfort.",

      "question": "Are there golden sparkles scattered within the snow globe due to sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues from Image B show golden sparkles inside the snow globe. Given the prevalent warm tones and the sunlight visible from the window, these sparkles can be attributed to the typical interaction of light with other elements, such as reflective glitter or particles found within decorative snow globes.",

      "question": "Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is indeed suspended within the snow globe, and there are visible gentle ripples, suggesting the presence of a liquid medium like water. Additionally, there are visual elements resembling delicate snowflakes drifting around the leaf. Therefore, the combined visual cues point towards the leaf being set in a watery environment enclosed by the snow globe, enhanced by drifting snowflake-like particles.",
