      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's body is rendered in a soft grey, which suggests a plush and fabric-like texture. This is identified by the visual appearance of the elephant which looks fluffy and soft, akin to a stuffed toy. The use of grey as the primary color is evident by the visual cues showing the majority of its body in grey tones. ",

      "question": "Are the inner ears of the elephant large and pink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inner section of the elephant's ears is visibly large and has a pink coloration. This is detected through visual observation of a distinct boundary within the ear, contrasting against the grey, and occupying a significant portion of the ear space. Thus, combining these cues with common toy design, which often utilizes exaggerated proportions for cuteness, it confirms the statement.",

      "question": "Does the elephant wear a small yellow hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is seen wearing a small yellow hat. This observation is drawn from visual identification of a hat-like object positioned on the elephant's head. It is small relative to the elephant’s head and bears a bright yellow color, making it identifiable as a cute accessory often used in toys or cartoons.",

      "question": "Is there a bright red and yellow ruffled collar around the elephant's neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B appears to have a ruffled collar around its neck composed of red and yellow fabric. This is indicated by visual elements showing a two-tiered colored fabric or ruffle that is clearly distinct from the rest of the elephant's body. Therefore, the presence of these colors in a ruffled pattern at the neck allows for this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the elephant illuminated by a warm, soft spotlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the elephant placed under a spotlight, evidenced by the bright circular illumination on the wooden stage and the noticeable lighting specifically highlighting the elephant against the darker background. This creates a warm ambiance due to the apparent soft contrast with surrounding elements and common lighting effects used to enhance the appearance of plush toys on stage.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stage in Image B appears to be made of wood, with visible texture suggesting wear and signs of aging. The surface details—the fine grain, color variations, and texture—indicate a weathered wooden appearance, often associated with older stage setups, adding rustic charm to the scene. Therefore, the visual cues align with common representations of aged wooden surfaces.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a curtain that appears to be made of a deep blue, velvet-like fabric adorned with star patterns. The rich blue hue along with the shiny star elements provides a traditional theatrical appearance typical of decorative backdrops used to enhance visual appeal, supporting the creative setting surrounding the elephant.",
