      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the laundromat and the person holding laundry, depicted using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, every aspect of the scene, from the exterior of the laundromat to the person and the folded laundry, exhibits the distinctive appearance of Lego bricks. The walls, the person, and the laundry all have the interlocking brick texture and shapes associated with Lego. This indicates that the entire scene is constructed with Lego bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the person and the folded laundry represented as Lego figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted as a typical Lego figure, characterized by the blocky shape and the molded hair, while the folded laundry is represented with Lego pieces stacked together to mimic real folded clothes. These features confirm the use of Lego bricks to represent both the person and the folded items.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the laundromat environment, including the walls, doors, and washing machines, constructed using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The environment in Image B, encompassing the laundromat's brick walls, doors, and visible washing machines inside, is crafted using Lego bricks. The walls are made of brick-shaped Lego pieces, while the door and interior elements like washing machines have the characteristic look of Lego constructs. This demonstrates the use of Lego bricks for the entire environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the scene have a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B has a static, built appearance due to being entirely made from Lego bricks. The structured and unchanging nature of the Lego construction aligns with the characteristics of a stop-motion diorama, where each component is deliberately placed to create a coherent scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the overall scene composition been maintained while adapting it to the Lego aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, while the medium of representation is different, the overall scene composition is preserved. Both images depict a laundromat setting with a person holding folded laundry in front. Despite the transformation into the Lego aesthetic, the main elements and layout are consistent between the two images, demonstrating that the composition has been maintained.",
