      "question": "Is the surface of the bed covered in patchwork fur made from the colors red, gray, navy, and white, resembling animal fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the bed appears to be covered in a patchwork pattern using fur. The fur exhibits a distinct animal-like texture, displaying colors such as red, gray, navy, and a bit of white. This furry appearance, resembling animal fur, is different from a typical blanket or comforter material, which is neither common nor conventional for bed coverings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pillows reshaped into pointed or rounded ears and trimmed with soft-looking leaves along their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the top part of the bed transformed to exhibit two pointed shapes that resemble ears. These ears are adorned with what appear to be leaves, suggesting the transformation of pillows into decorative elements stylized to look like ears. This design is unconventional for pillows, as pillows are usually rectangular or oval without decorative edges like leaves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the black bed frame been replaced with thin, branch-like legs that resemble natural tree limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame that supports the bed in Image B indeed appears to consist of thin, branch-like structures. These resemble tree limbs and are quite different from the typical solid and vertical bed legs found in standard bed frames. The use of these natural limb-like support structures is atypical and would normally not be used for bed construction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a bushy, plush red tail extending from the bottom edge of the comforter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the foot of the bed, there is a discernible bushy, plush red tail that appears to extend from the comforter. This tail-like feature is not characteristic of standard bedding materials, indicating an intentional redesign to incorporate an animal-like element.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the patchwork fur on the bed use only the colors red, gray, navy, and white as seen in the original blanket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the patchwork fur indeed utilizes the colors red, gray, navy, and a hint of white, similar to the original blanket pattern seen in Image A. However, the texture has been altered to resemble fur rather than the fabric of a blanket, but the color scheme remains consistent with the original design.",
