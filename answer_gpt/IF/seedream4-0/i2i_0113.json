      "question": "Is the character presented as a soft vinyl figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to have a glossy, smooth texture with seam lines visible, common in soft vinyl figures. The overall shape and style, including the proportions and molded details like the suit and accessories, also suggest a figurine rather than a realistic human form. These traits are consistent with the characteristics of a soft vinyl figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is clearly positioned on a circular black platform. This is typical of many collectible figures and models, where bases are used to provide stability and display aesthetics. The presence of the base under the character's feet is evident.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a variety of weapons are displayed on the base alongside the character. These include guns and a knife, which are typical accessories for action figures representing combat characters. Their presence on the base specifically indicates they are meant to be interchangeable and used with the figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple hands in various poses are noticeable on the base. These are interchangeable accessories typical of figures, allowing the display of different gestures and interactions with other accessories like weapons. The distinct shapes and separated placement from the figure suggest they can be swapped out.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the character wears a distinct black suit with red accents. Image B’s figure retains these key features—the suit's texture, color, and design are notably similar to those in Image A, making the character easily recognizable despite the adaptation into a figure format. These consistent details maintain the character's iconic look.",
