      "question": "Does the person appear in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is portrayed with smooth, simplistic features and a glossy texture that is characteristic of 3D cartoon animation. The proportions are exaggerated, and the style is consistent with typical 3D animation renditions of real-life scenes.",

      "question": "Has the frisbee been replaced with a spinning metal shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in the child's hand appears metallic with circular motion lines around it, suggesting rotation. This resembles a sci-fi depiction of a shield in motion rather than a traditional frisbee.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features futuristic architectural elements and lighting, with neon accents and a metallic interior, characteristic of a sci-fi environment rather than the suburban street scene in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the style change, the person maintains the same stance on the block with raised arms, mimicking the original pose. The shared pose confirms continuity in posture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the metal shield look metallic and seem to be spinning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a shiny, reflective surface typical of metal, with dynamic motion lines indicating spinning. These elements suggest the object is a spinning metal shield.",
