      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person appears as a small, cartoonish figure with exaggerated features typical of chibi art, such as a large head and a small body, along with smooth, shiny, and plastic-like textures that are commonly found in 3D models. This visual change is distinct from the more realistic and proportionate figure found in Image A.",
