      "question": "Is the overall composition stylized with strong geometric lines, symmetry, and decorative elements typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals a strong focus on geometric shapes and symmetry, characterized by the precise lines and triangular elements in the suit and chair. These features resonate with the Art Deco movement, which emphasizes bold geometry and decorative motifs. The use of metallic colors further supports this style, as Art Deco often embraces glamor and luxurious materials.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B is distinctly outlined with angular, geometric forms. The use of metallic silver and blue colors is visually striking and deviates from the traditional fabric depiction seen in Image A. These colors and shapes emphasize a modern, stylized appearance, consistent with the described transformation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the overall posture of the figure remains similar, with the arms crossed, the facial features are not clearly visible due to the blurring. This differs from Image A, where such features might be more distinct. The pose, however, remains consistent between the two images.",
