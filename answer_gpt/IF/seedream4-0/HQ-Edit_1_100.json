      "question": "Is there a visible calendar layout element (such as a date, month, or decorative border) indicating the image is formatted as an art calendar page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a layout with a grid of dates at the bottom, labeled with days and visually resembling a calendar.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure exhibit characteristics of a half-cartoon style, such as stylized facial features, smooth lines, or exaggerated proportions while maintaining realism in other areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has exaggeratedly smooth lines and stylized features typical of a cartoon style, such as simplified lines and shapes. There is no indication of maintaining realism in other areas as all visible elements adhere to the cartoon style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book in the foreground visibly longer than a normal book, with an elongated shape that exceeds typical proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book appears to have normal proportions with no visible extension in length beyond what is typical for books. There is nothing in the image indicating that the book's shape or proportions are unusual.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sleeves display soft, flowing drapery with visible folds and gentle curvature, suggesting fabric texture and movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the sleeves with smooth, cartoonish lines without the depiction of detailed fabric texture or movement. The sleeves appear flat and stylized rather than textured or flowing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons on the garment appear to be decorative, featuring drawings of loops over them which resemble simple filigree. These elements are stylized rather than intricate engravings, but they fit the description of golden decorative patterns.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear wooden border in the corner forming a frame around the scene, visible within the composition. This gives the image a framed appearance that is distinct due to its bold outline.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are visual elements such as warm lighting, aged books, wooden surfaces, and focused reading posture present to enhance the scholarly atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B employs some elements like a reading posture and books that suggest a scholarly activity, the overall warmth and texture that create an atmospheric setting are missing. The stylized cartoon nature limits the inclusion of realistic textures and warmth associated with scholarly environments.",
