    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire castle scene enclosed within a transparent glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear, transparent glass orb surrounds the entire scene of the castle and the knight. This globe-like structure encapsulates the contents inside, creating a snow globe effect. This conclusion is drawn from the visual outline of the orb which distinctly encloses the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stone textures on the castle walls visibly smaller and more detailed, consistent with a minified appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone textures on the castle walls appear to be more compact and detailed, which aligns with a miniature representation. This effect is commonly observed in models or miniatures where details are emphasized to maintain realism at a smaller scale.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knight’s armor and the gate structure rendered in an antique bronze color with visible aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight’s armor and the gate structure appear in a metallic sheen more akin to steel rather than antique bronze, with no distinct aging effects such as patina or tarnishing visible that are characteristic of aged bronze.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, fluttering heraldic flags visible on the battlements of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small flags can be seen on the battlements of the castle. These flags are proportional to the miniature scale of the castle model and add a touch of realism, emphasizing heraldic elements often present in castles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small turrets and crenellated walls arranged in a circular pattern around the base of the glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the glass orb is decorated with small turrets and crenellated walls that form a circular boundary. This arrangement enhances the castle-like theme and is typical for creating a realistic miniature diorama within a spherical enclosure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are golden light rays visibly sculpted into the glass of the orb, emanating from behind the castle to simulate a rising sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, golden light rays seem to be emanating from behind the castle, contributing to a sunrise effect. However, these rays appear more like a layered visual element within the scene, rather than being sculpted into the glass of the orb itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
