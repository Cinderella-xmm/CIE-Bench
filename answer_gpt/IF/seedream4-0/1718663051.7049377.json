      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding elements exhibit clear geometric contours and segmented areas resembling stained glass panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements including the tree and surrounding environment exhibit clear, sharply defined geometric contours with segmented areas filled with solid colors. This style is reminiscent of stained glass panels where different colored glass pieces are bordered by metal. This gives the impression of a structured, segmented area characteristic of stained glass art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the treeâ€™s branches composed of angular, geometric shapes rather than organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches of the tree are rendered using angular, geometric shapes as opposed to the more fluid, organic curves typically seen in natural trees. This stylization aligns with the aesthetics of stained glass art, where straight lines and sharp angles are commonly used for segmentation and structure.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the grass rendered in desaturated, low-saturation colors consistent with a muted palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a set of solid colors indicative of glass pieces, which often hold a uniform tint rather than exhibiting natural, muted gradients seen in grass in natural imagery. The colors here do not specifically reflect a desaturated or muted palette as it's more a representation of stained glass coloring style rather than natural hues.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mountains depicted with sharp, angular forms and colored in shades of bronze and teal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted using distinct angular forms with clear, defined edges and are colored using shades like bronze and teal. These are typical color choices and structural elements for depicting landscapes in a stained glass style where bold color choices are separated by dark lines, emphasizing shape and contrast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient and include visible accentuated lines or decorative patterns that convey vintage elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is represented by solid geometric segments rather than a smooth gradient. It includes defined lines as part of the stained glass style; however, these do not convey the vintage elegance associated with smooth, flowing patterns typically found in classic art deco or vintage styles. The described accentuated decor and elegance are not the focal point of this stained glass representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the elements in the image composed of flat, solid-colored regions bounded by dark, defined lines characteristic of stained glass art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indeed features elements that are composed of flat, solid-colored regions bounded by distinctly dark lines. This is characteristic of stained glass art, where different colored glass pieces form compartments bordered by leading strips. This distinct style uses defined lines to ensure each color is separated, resulting in the effect seen in traditional stained glass windows.",
