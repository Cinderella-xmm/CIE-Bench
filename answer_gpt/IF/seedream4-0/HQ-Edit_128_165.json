      "question": "Has the ornate lantern been fully transformed into a jellyfish shape, with a bell-shaped body and flowing appendages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a jellyfish, characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped body and tendril-like appendages flowing beneath it. This description aligns with the common structure of a jellyfish. When comparing with Image A, where an ornate lantern was present, it is clear that Image B has completely transformed the lantern into the shape of a jellyfish, as no features of the lantern remain visible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the metal framing elements been replaced with iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils extending from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish has numerous iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils flowing from the bell-shaped body. This is a distinctive characteristic of jellyfish anatomy as they have such flowing appendages. In comparison with Image A, where metal framing was part of the lantern structure, these metal parts have been entirely replaced by the colorful, fluid tendrils characteristic of a jellyfish.",

      "question": "Have the glass panels been transformed into a translucent, bell-shaped body that appears soft and fluid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the jellyfish is depicted as a translucent, soft-looking bell shape, which is typical of a jellyfish's body. This contrasts with the glass panels seen in Image A's lantern, indicating that these panels have been visually transformed into the body of the jellyfish, giving it the characteristic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original patterns replaced with glowing, swirling, organic bioluminescent designs within the jellyfish's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features patterns on the jellyfish that are glowing and swirling, resembling organic, bioluminescent designs. These designs add to the jellyfish's ethereal and aquatic appearance. The original geometric and metallic patterns of the lantern from Image A appear completely replaced by these organic designs in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing, star-like nodules visible along the length of the iridescent tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tendrils of the jellyfish feature several glowing, star-like nodules scattered along their length. These enhance the fantastical and bioluminescent aspect of the jellyfish. This feature is new in Image B and was not present in Image A, which had no such nodules or glowing elements along the metal frames of the lantern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the jellyfish depicted floating in an underwater environment with ambient lighting, soft diffusion, and visual elements suggesting water (e.g., particles, light rays, depth)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish is clearly depicted in an underwater setting. This is suggested by visual elements such as the ambient lighting, which is diffuse and shows the interplay of light rays typical in aquatic scenes, as well as the blurred background imitating water depth and floating particles. These set a convincing underwater environment, unlike the ceiling setting in Image A.",
