    "Question": "Q1: Have the couple's backs been designed as a crystal silhouette?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the couple's backs have been replaced with a design that resembles a crystal structure. This is evident from the faceted and reflective surface that mimics that of crystals or gemstones. The distinct texture and patterning on their figures are indicative of crystalline qualities, suggesting that their backs have indeed been designed with a crystal silhouette.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the design maintain the integrity of the couple's original back shape as silhouettes?",
    "explanation": "In both images, the subjects are depicted sitting on a bench in a certain posture. Although the edited image introduces a crystal-like structure, it appears to maintain the basic pose and proportions of the couple when viewed from behind in Image A. Thus, it keeps the integrity of their original back shape within the crystalline representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the couple’s back silhouettes show transparency and reflective qualities?",
    "explanation": "The edited design in Image B demonstrates transparency and reflectivity, as evidenced by how the light interacts with the crystal-like surfaces. The surfaces appear translucent and mirror-like, casting patterns that are typical of glass or crystals. This highlights the transparency and reflective attributes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the surrounding environment (bench, tree, grass) unchanged except for the edited couple’s backs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, apart from the alteration in the couple's appearance, the rest of the environment, including the bench, trees, and grass, appears consistent with Image A. There are no noticeable changes or edits applied to these elements, indicating that the edit focused solely on the couple.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the overall design, featuring the crystal silhouettes of the couple, align with the aesthetic suitable for Valentine's Day gifts?",
