      "question": "Has the forest background been replaced with a city balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a yellow bird perched on what appears to be a metallic balcony railing. The background consists of blurry, vertical structures resembling buildings and a clear sky, typical of a city skyline in the distance. This context aligns with a city environment rather than a natural forest setting.",

      "question": "Is the bird positioned on the sunlit balcony as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is indeed positioned on a balcony railing, with sunlight visible illuminating the scene, casting light on the bird and part of the railing. This suggests the bird is on a sunlit balcony as per the description.",

      "question": "Is there a blurred city skyline visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop of Image B shows out-of-focus towers or high-rise structures, consistent with the typical appearance of a city skyline. This blurred effect indicates that the background showcases a distant city view, aligning with the context of a skyline.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird maintain its original position relative to the new balcony railing background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bird is perched on a natural branch, while in Image B, it is on a balcony railing. The bird's positioning on its perch within the frame is similar in both images, suggesting that its position relative to the perch has been maintained. Therefore, the relative position of the bird compared to the railing is consistent with the original composition with the branch.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is warm and appears to come from the lower right side of the image, suggesting a sunrise or sunset scenario. This lighting casts a glow on the bird and the balcony, creating a warm ambiance consistent with sunshine flooding a balcony in the morning or late afternoon.",
