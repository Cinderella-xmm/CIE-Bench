      "question": "Is the ballerina depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated proportions and a significantly larger or more voluminous tutu than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a ballerina that appears to be drawn in a cartoon style, characterized by simplified lines and forms that deviate from realistic anatomy. The tutu is illustrated with multiple layers and exaggerated volume, creating a more whimsical appearance in comparison to typical photographic styles. In Image A, the ballerina's tutu appears more realistic with a single-layer design adhering closely to the body's proportion. These observations lead to the conclusion that Image B employs a cartoon style with exaggerated tutu proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the background of the image composed of soft pastel shades such as light pink, lavender, or mint green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is predominantly soft and muted, featuring light pink and other pastel colors, which are often used to convey a gentle and dreamy atmosphere in art. This contrasts with the dark, spotlight-lit stage setting in Image A. The soft pastel background in Image B suggests a light and cheerful mood, typical of environments where such colors are employed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible glitter accents (such as sparkling dots or shimmering patterns) added to the ballerinaâ€™s costume?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's costume includes visible sparkling or shimmering effects, notably around the edges of the tutu and the bodice, enhancing the costume's appearance with glitter accents. Image A, by contrast, presents a realistic depiction without such exaggerated sparkling elements. The presence of such glitter effects in Image B adds a fantastical and decorative touch to the costume.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there clearly designated blank areas on the image suitable for adding written messages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features multiple blank white areas strategically placed around the ballerina, ideal for inserting written messages or personalized notes. These areas are distinct and unobstructed, suggesting a design that accommodates text additions. Image A lacks such designated spaces, focusing solely on the ballerina's image. The presence of these blank spaces in Image B allows for flexibility in customization.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there floral motifs (such as flowers or leaves) present along the borders of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the borders are adorned with floral motifs, including flowers and leaves, which add decorative elements typical in artistic and illustrative designs. Image A, however, focuses on the central figure without any border decorations. The incorporation of these floral details in Image B enhances the visual aesthetic with nature-inspired embellishments.",
