      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a squirrel can clearly be seen in the foreground of the painting. Its distinct shape, coloration, and detail make it easily identifiable as a squirrel. Its position and prominence in the lower portion of the artwork give it a foreground placement, directly in view of the observer.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel blend naturally with the painting's brushstrokes and color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B appears highly detailed, with realistic textures that contrast with the characteristic swirling brushstrokes and abstract styling of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night.' The color palette of the squirrel, particularly its warm brown hues, contrasts sharply with the dominant blues and yellows in the painting, making it stand out rather than blend. Thus, the squirrel does not completely harmonize with the painting's style and color scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the squirrel positioned in the foreground, closer to the viewer than other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the squirrel is clearly in the foreground. It is situated in the lower left part of the painting, in front of the prominent cypress tree that occupies the same space in the original artwork. Its size and overlapping placement with other painting elements reinforce its proximity to the viewer, making it apparent that it is closer than other elements in the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Does the addition of the squirrel maintain the overall harmony and composition of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of the squirrel in Image B disrupts the harmony and composition of the original painting. The surreal and abstract nature of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' contrasts with the realistic portrayal of the squirrel, resulting in an aesthetic discord. The squirrel's location and styling do not align with the painting's established flow and brushstrokes, affecting the overall composition.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the squirrel sized appropriately in relation to other elements in the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When considering the elements in Van Gogh's 'Starry Night,' the size of objects is exaggerated to highlight certain aspects of perspective and emotion. In Image B, the squirrel appears proportionally large compared to the structures in the village below, which are more characteristic of distant background elements in the original painting. Given these aspects, the size of the squirrel does not seem appropriately scaled relative to the other painting features, appearing too large for its setting.",
