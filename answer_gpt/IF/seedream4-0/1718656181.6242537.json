      "question": "Is the explosion depicted as a mural painted on a beach wall, rather than occurring naturally in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual characteristics of the explosion suggest it is depicted as a mural. The explosion has an outlined appearance, with stylized colors and clear separation from natural atmospheric effects, indicating an artistic representation rather than a natural occurrence. Additionally, the visible texture of the wall-like surface, along with the sandy foreground, implies that the setting is on a beach. These cues support the interpretation that the explosion is part of a mural painted on a beach wall.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the explosion and surrounding elements bright and neon-like, consistent with pop art aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an explosion and surrounding elements with bright, vibrant colors such as red, yellow, blue, and pink, which are typical of pop art aesthetics. These colors stand out due to their neon-like saturation and contrast, aligning with the bold and vivid color schemes often used in pop art. The interpretation of this artistic choice is evident from the use of these striking hues throughout the mural.",

      "question": "Do all major elements (explosion, clouds, palm trees, landforms) have thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays all major components, including the explosion, clouds, palm trees, and landforms, with thick black outlines. This style is a signature trait of graphic art and pop art, used to emphasize and delineate different sections distinctly. The consistent application of these black outlines across the various elements reinforces this art style, making each component stand out clearly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the palm trees stylized with exaggerated forms and bold outlines, consistent with pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees exhibit exaggerated forms with simplistic shapes and are accentuated by bold black outlines. These artistic choices match the pop art style, where figures are often depicted with exaggerated or simplified forms for visual impact and clarity. The stylized approach of these palm trees aligns with the overarching pop art theme present in the entire mural.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are geometric patterns (e.g., stripes, grids, polygons) visibly embedded within the cloud formations of the explosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, geometric patterns can be observed within the cloud formations of the explosion. Patterns like stripes and other polygonal shapes are integrated into the design, adding a layer of abstraction and complexity typical of pop art. These geometric elements contribute to the stylized aesthetic, making them a recognizable feature in the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the island landscape been transformed into simplified abstract shapes, lacking realistic terrain details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island landscape is depicted using simplified, abstract shapes that intentionally lack detailed and realistic terrain features. The landforms and other geographic components are reduced to basic geometric forms, consistent with the approach of removing realism in favor of a more representational or abstract look. This simplification aligns with pop art styles where detailed realism is often foregone for bolder, more impactful visuals.",
