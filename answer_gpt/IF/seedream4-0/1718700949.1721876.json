      "question": "Is the elephant depicted as a smaller-scale version enclosed within a transparent glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is shown within a transparent glass display case, suggesting it is a smaller-scale representation or a model rather than a life-sized elephant. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues such as the glass enclosure that typically houses artifacts or models and the comparative size of the decorative elements inside the case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate armor details on the elephant rendered with a shiny, metallic-resin-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor details on the elephant exhibit a shiny and reflective surface which mimics a metallic or resin-like texture. This is inferred from the visual gloss and the sculptural detailing on the armor that suggests a crafted representation rather than fabric or dull material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there four small golden banners made of silk-like material positioned at each corner of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are evident silk-like golden ribbons draped at the top corners of the glass display case, serving as decorative elements. However, they do not especially appear at each corner; rather, they are visibly positioned at the top corners on each side.",

      "question": "Does the background feature multiple layers of mountains with translucent, soft-edged silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B does indeed showcase layered mountain shapes with smooth and translucent qualities, creating a soft-edged silhouette appearance. This is derived from the visible softly defined, layered forms in the background that suggest a stylized depiction of mountains.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly stylized bonsai-like trees placed at the foreground of the display, flanking the elephant model. This is concluded from the recognizable bonsai shape and placement style which are meant to enhance the aesthetics of the display.",
