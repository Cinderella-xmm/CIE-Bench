    "Question": "Q1: Has a person been added to the image near the zebra's tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a person clearly visible to the left of the zebra, near its hindquarters. A person interacting with or standing close to a wild animal in an edited image usually indicates they've been added for that specific purpose. Since this human figure is not a native part of such wildlife imagery, it logically follows that they have been added.",
    "answer": "Yes"
