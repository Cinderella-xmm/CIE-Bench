    "Question": "Q1: Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a sequence of actions depicted in four separate frames. Each frame illustrates different stages of a tennis swing sequence: starting from a preparatory stance, moving through the swing action, the ball contact (hit), and what appears to be a follow-through motion. This progression aligns with typical depictions of a sports instructional sequence, where actions are broken down step-by-step.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the 4-frame illustration arranged in a horizontal format as an instructional strip?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the frames stacked vertically, not horizontally. The sequence of four frames is presented one above the other, which is typical of instructional sequences designed to guide the viewer step-by-step through a process or action. Hence, the arrangement is vertical.",
