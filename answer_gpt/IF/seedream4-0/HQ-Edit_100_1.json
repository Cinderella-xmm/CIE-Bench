    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly contained within a wooden shadow box frame. The wooden edges are visible around the entire scene, suggesting that it is a crafted artwork presented within a box, which is common for dioramas or shadow boxes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the tree been scaled down in size and rendered with enhanced 3D surface texture (e.g., visible bark details, depth, shading)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree appears much smaller in scale and is placed within a shadow box, which inherently reduces its size relative to a natural setting. The tree is crafted with detailed 3D textures, evidenced by the visible bark details and the shading that gives it depth, typical of sculpted miniatures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers (e.g., pink, yellow, blue, red) beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct, visible patches of multi-colored flowers beneath the tree. These include noticeable patches in pink, yellow, blue, and additional floral elements that contribute to a colorful foreground.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background consist of multiple layered painted surfaces that create a sense of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background showcases what looks like multiple vertical panels or layers with different colors and textures painted on them. These contribute to a perceived sense of depth, as each layer adds a different dimension and texture to the backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires above or within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires, floating within the scene. These clouds are crafted elements made to hang above the tree, emphasizing the three-dimensional aspect and whimsical nature of the representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image include surreal or stylized elements (e.g., floating clouds, soft glow, pastel hues) that contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes stylized elements such as the hand-crafted clouds suspended in the air, the use of pastel hues, and the careful arrangement of elements within the shadow box. These details, combined with the miniature, textural presentation, contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere, as often seen in stylized dioramas or artistic interpretations.",
