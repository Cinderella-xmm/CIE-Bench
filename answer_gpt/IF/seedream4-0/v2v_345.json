      "question": "Has the mouse been converted into a 3D voxel-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse appears as a 3D voxel-style model. This is indicated by the blocky, pixelated structure that mimics the appearance of digital voxel art. Voxel art is characterized by its use of distinct cubes, similar to building blocks, to create models. Recognizing these characteristics confirms that the mouse is depicted in a voxel style.",

      "question": "Does the voxel-style mouse model resemble the icons shown on the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any icons on the left for comparison. The question may refer to a hypothetical or implied left region, but based strictly on the content of Image B, no such icons exist for direct comparison to the voxel-style mouse model.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Was the scene rendered using Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without explicit visual cues or metadata in Image B indicating the rendering engine, it is not possible to definitively determine that the scene was rendered with Octane. Images rendered with specific engines may have particular qualities, but these cannot be inferred with certainty solely from viewing the image. Such a determination requires technical details beyond visible examination.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scene rendered in 8k resolution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based solely on visible detail, it is not possible to accurately assess the pixel resolution (such as 8k) of Image B. High-resolution images typically allow for substantial detail without blurring when scaled, but this requires more extensive technical evaluation than simply viewing the image. Hence, making a definitive claim about the resolution based on visual inspection alone without additional information is not feasible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the rest of the scene, excluding the mouse, unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual comparison between Image A and Image B, aside from the transformation of the mouse into a voxel-style model, shows that other elements like the phone and the wooden surface appear to remain consistent between the two images. This suggests that these parts of the scene are unchanged.",
