      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug's surface resembles polished wood, with a glossy finish that is not typical of living animals. The absence of fur and the presence of a shiny, reflective surface suggest a carved wooden sculpture instead of a living dog. The smooth, continuous appearance of the material and its sheen further indicate a non-organic origin, supporting this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the fur been replaced with smooth, polished wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the pug lacks the individual strands of fur seen on a living dog. Instead, it features a continuous, smooth texture typical of polished wood, with visible grain patterns. The transformation to a wood texture substitutes for the fur, providing a sleek and uniform appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carved wooden pug in Image B displays a rich, deep brown color characteristic of walnut wood. This color scheme mimics the original pug's pattern by using darker and lighter shades to highlight its features, such as the face and ears, thus maintaining the visual pattern seen in the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug's facial features are indicated by defined lines and grooves typical of an etched or carved surface. These are distinctly different from the soft, flexible wrinkles of a living dog. The highlights and shadows created by these carvings define the pug's expression and details, lending to the durability and texture of wood.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden pug placed on a simple black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden pug rests on a visibly black base that appears to be simple and smooth, without any intricate detailing or embellishments. The contrast in color and texture between the shiny black base and the wooden sculpture enhances the display of the sculpture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the black base provide a stark contrast to the rich wood texture of the sculpture, emphasizing its craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black base in Image B, with its smooth and dark surface, contrasts sharply against the rich, warm tones and the detailed grain of the wooden pug sculpture. This color and texture difference highlights the pug's polished craftsmanship, drawing attention to its artisanal qualities.",
