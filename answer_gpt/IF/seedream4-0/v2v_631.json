      "question": "Does the image feature warm tones and soft lighting effects?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tones predominantly feature cooler shades like purple, rather than warm tones like red or yellow. The lighting appears somewhat dramatic, with contrast between the illuminated areas and shadowed regions, typical of a digital rendering rather than 'soft' lighting. These visual cues lead to the conclusion that the image does not feature warm tones and soft lighting.",
