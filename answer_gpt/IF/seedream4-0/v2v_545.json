      "question": "Is the sparrow depicted in a 3D-rendered form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow has characteristics typical of 3D rendering, such as smooth surfaces, defined contours, and a three-dimensional depth that suggests it is a digitally created model rather than a photograph. The sparrow details are stylized, and the rendering quality makes it look like a 3D object.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit the animation style characteristic of Pixar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sparrow in a very stylized, cartoonish format that is reminiscent of Pixarâ€™s animation style, which often includes exaggerated features such as large eyes, expressive shapes, and smooth textures. This style is identifiable by its polished rendering and the whimsical representation characteristic of Pixar's animation techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sparrow perched on the wooden chair in a realistic manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the sparrow appears perched on the chair in a believable manner, conforming to how a real bird might perch. The feet of the sparrow grip the edge of the chair plausibly, matching the common way birds balance on thin surfaces. Image A also shows a sparrow perched naturally in a similar way, enhancing the realistic perception in Image B despite its stylization.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the textures on the sparrow and the chair appear polished and detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sparrow and the chair exhibit smooth and refined surfaces, typical of polished digital textures often seen in 3D models. The wood grain texture on the chair and the sparrow's feathers are rendered to appear neat and intricate, contributing to the polished appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rich and lively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents vivid and vibrant colors, making the sparrow and the chair visually striking. The sparrow's plumage displays rich browns and whites, while the chair has a glowing wooden tone, consistent with lively coloration often used to emphasize aesthetic appeal in rendered images.",
