    "Question": "Q1: Has the spiral staircase been fully replaced by a serpent-shaped form that follows the same helical path?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent takes on a helical shape similar to the original staircase, winding up as a natural spiral. However, the stairs themselves are still present, with the serpent coiling around them rather than completing replacing them. This indicates that while the serpent visually follows the spiral path, the staircase itself remains intact beneath it.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the serpent’s body feature detailed lattice-like scales across its surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent is adorned with detailed lattice-like scales along its body, which is a common characteristic of many serpentine creatures. These scales are intricately designed and uniformly cover the serpent, providing a textured appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the serpent’s body extended downward in a way that visually replicates the step-like descent of the original staircase?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body is seen winding downwards in parallel to the staircase, but it does not replicate the step-like descent of the original staircase. Instead, it wraps around the central spiral, providing an organic appearance compared to the geometric linear steps.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are ornate, filigree-like patterns present on the serpent’s body, matching the style of the original railing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body is characterized by scales rather than ornate patterns. However, the original railing, with its filigree design, still appears alongside the serpent's coiled form, suggesting that the elaborate patterns are not transferred to the serpent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the banister been replaced with a series of delicate, translucent fins along the serpent’s side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the railing of the staircase remains intact alongside the serpent; however, the serpent is depicted with delicate, translucent fins along its side. These fins appear to be a creative addition to the serpent’s body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a serpent’s head positioned at the uppermost point of the spiral, featuring two distinct luminescent gem-like eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, at the apex of the spiral, the serpent features a distinctive head. Its eyes indeed appear luminescent and gem-like, consistent with a fantastical representation often depicted in mythological or artistic renderings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the serpent’s body display a marble-like texture with visible veining and polished surface characteristics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body has a marble-like appearance. This is shown by the smooth, polished surface characteristics and the visible veining typical of marble. The texture mimics the glossy finish found in stonework.",
    "answer": "Yes"
