    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the black checkmark pathway depicted as tangled and circuitous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation of the pathway features multiple elements that suggest a convoluted route, such as the intertwined red tape and additional stamps. These additions imply complexity in the pathway's depiction. The pathway in Image A is straightforward without those complex visual indicators.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 'We verify your Document' icon show multiple overlapping stamps of approval?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icon features several overlapping stamps within the orange circle, suggesting multiple layers of verification or approval. Image A does not include these stamps, indicating that the addition in Image B signifies more complexity in this step.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visual motifs of entangled red tape woven through the orange circular step markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows red tape tangling through and around the orange circular markers, illustrating bureaucratic complexity. Image A lacks this red tape, indicating a straightforward representation without such added complexity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the infographic reflect an adaptation to increased bureaucratic complexity for Qatar document processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of tangled red tape and overlapping stamps in Image B visually suggests increased bureaucratic hurdles. These elements indicate adaptation to the complexity of document processing, which are absent in Image A's simpler depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the infographic maintain coherence and clarity despite the added complexity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the complexity shown in Image B, such as the tangled red tape and additional stamps, the layout still follows the original path and maintains the sequence of steps, assisting in understanding the process even with added elements. This reflects coherence amidst complexity.",
