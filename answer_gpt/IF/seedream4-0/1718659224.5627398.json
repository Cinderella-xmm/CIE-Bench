      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress appears to be made of materials that closely resemble cookie dough. It has a consistent golden-brown color typical of a baked cookie, and the edges appear darker, suggesting that it's been 'baked.' This visual detail combined with common knowledge about the appearance of baked goods supports the conclusion that the fortress is constructed from cookie dough with baked-like edges.",

      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the walls and towers of the fortress exhibit a golden-brown hue with darker edges. This color pattern is reminiscent of baked cookie dough where edges tend to be slightly darker due to the baking process. This color scheme aligns with the appearance of cookies that have been baked, indicating that the fortress's structure mimics baked cookie dough.",

      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls are depicted as white, smooth, and glossy, unlike natural water which would be transparent and less structured. These characteristics resemble royal icing, a common confectionery decoration used in baking, which is often piped smoothly and glistens when set. This visual representation clearly sets apart the portrayal from natural water streams.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees in the image made from smooth, uniformly green-colored marzipan with no realistic leaf detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are depicted as simple, smooth, uniformly green objects without any detailed foliage that real trees have. They resemble marzipan or similar confectionery items often used in cake decorations. Marzipan is known for its smooth texture and its ability to hold shapes without intricate details, aligning with the appearance of these trees.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cookie castle placed on a large, flat, white ceramic platter that is clearly visible beneath and around the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire structure of the cookie castle is situated on a flat, white surface that looks like a ceramic platter, commonly used for displaying baked goods. The border of the platter is visible, suggesting that the castle rests upon it. The reflection and shine associated with ceramic enhance this impression, confirming the platter's presence and visibility.",
