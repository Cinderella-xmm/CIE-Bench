      "question": "Has the original rose petals been completely replaced by a perfume bottle design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary object is a perfume bottle with a highly detailed design which occupies the central focus. There are no visible rose petals as one would expect in a floral composition. Instead, the bottle itself, with a rose-shaped cap and etched floral patterns, stands in place of individual rose petals. Thus, the bottle design replaces what could be the representation of physical petals.",
