    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pigeon rendered as a plush toy with soft, rounded features and a fabric-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pigeon in Image B has a soft, rounded appearance that resembles a plush toy rather than a real pigeon. The texture appears to be made of fabric, indicative of a plush toy design. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues of soft edges and textile-like texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a vibrant blue chest and gray wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush pigeon prominently features a blue chest and gray wings, which are typical characteristics found in plush toy designs. The distinct color combination is clearly visible, affirming the description.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there subtle feather-like patterns visible on the surface of the plush pigeon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the pigeon in Image B has defined shapes representing wings and body parts, the visual cues do not show any intricate, subtle feather-like patterns akin to real feathers. The texture is more uniform, characteristic of plush material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the architectural structures in the background rendered as cookie-like forms with embossed or textured surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The architectural structures in Image B display a cookie-like quality, showing embossed or textured surfaces that mimic the look of baked goods. This interpretation comes from seeing structured patterns similar to those in embossed cookies, confirmed by the overall color and texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush pigeon is positioned on what appears to be a shelf with a wooden texture, characterized by linear patterns and a consistent color that suggest it is made from wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the soft, plush texture of the pigeon and the hard, embossed texture of the cookie architecture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable contrast between the plush, fabric-like texture of the pigeon and the hard, cookie-like embossed texture of the architectural parts. This difference is evident through the disparity in texture and material representation.",
