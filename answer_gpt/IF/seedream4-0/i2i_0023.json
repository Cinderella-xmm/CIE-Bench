      "question": "Has the photo been converted into a minimalist flat illustration-style sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design style is flat and minimalist, characteristic of illustration-style stickers. The use of bold outlines and simplified shapes reduces the complexity and texture typical in the original photograph, favoring simple block colors and clearly defined areas. This style differs significantly from the photographic details in Image A, indicating a conversion to an illustration-style sticker.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the boy and all bird outlines clearly present in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy and birds are outlined with bold, definitive lines, distinguishing each form and contour clearly. This differs from Image A where outlines are formed naturally by texture and shadows within the photograph, indicating the transition to a more graphic, outlined style in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have block colors been used for the boy's skin tones and the birds' feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features block colors—flat, uniform areas without gradients or texture—for both the boy's skin tones and the birds' feathers. This contrasts with Image A, where colors are formed with gradients and various shades, characteristic of a photograph rather than an illustration. The use of block colors is typical in illustration styles to minimize complexity and enhance visual simplicity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely removed, focusing solely on the subjects (the boy and birds) against a transparent background. This is a significant change compared to Image A, where the background includes walls and other details, which have been removed in the edited image to isolate the subjects.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the boy’s head been slightly enlarged and the birds shrunk to achieve a neatly arranged composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions appear adjusted for sticker-style appeal, but there is no evident alteration in size of the boy's head or birds; they maintain a similar relative size as in Image A. This indicates no deliberate enlargement or shrinking for composition benefits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has a thick white outline been added around the boy and birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a thick white outline surrounding the boy and the birds, typical of stickers, to neatly delineate the edges and enhance their visual separation from any background if present. This stylistic choice is absent in Image A, confirming this addition in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image have a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a transparent background, evident from the absence of any visual content behind the outlined subjects, contrasting with Image A where the background is fully visible. This characteristic aligns with sticker design aesthetics that frequently utilize transparency to focus on icons.",
