      "question": "Has snow been added to the clock tower and the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower is visibly covered with snow on its structure, including the roof and balcony area. This visual cue indicates that snow has been added, which aligns with common signs of winter or snowy environments. Thus, snow has indeed been added.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the flags been replaced with icy patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flags on either side of the clock tower are altered to show a translucent icy design. This is a significant change from typical cloth flags, indicating an icy pattern replacement. Thus, the flags have been replaced with icy patterns.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the overall scene reflect a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays several winter indicators: the snow accumulation on the clock tower and the icy-patterned flags are strong suggestions of a winter setting. These visual cues, combined with the common association of snow and ice formations with winter, reflect a winter atmosphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there visible snow accumulation on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is noticeable snow accumulation on the structures of Image B's clock tower, including the roof, balcony, and ledges. This visible snow cover suggests significant accumulation, indicating it has been intentionally added as part of the edit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the flags display distinct icy patterns that differ from the original green and yellow stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the flags exhibit green and yellow stripes, a common pattern for flags. In Image B, the flags are transformed into icy or frosted designs with translucent and shimmering patterns. This distinct visual contrast confirms the difference from the original flags.",
