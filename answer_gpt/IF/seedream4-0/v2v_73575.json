      "explanation": "The bird on the right in Image B is depicted as a structure made from a material resembling crystal or glass. Its edges are sharp, and it possesses a light-refracting quality commonly associated with crystalline formations, which gives it a glowing effect, likely due to the way light interacts with the facet surfaces, creating luminance.",
