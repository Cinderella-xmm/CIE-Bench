        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging box in Image B is shown at an angle where the top, front, and side views are partially visible. This presentation aligns with the characteristics of an isometric perspective, where the depth is evident, and multiple sides of the object are shown.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the items inside the packaging box do not appear to be chibi-style, but rather regular versions of the robots, indicated by their design and proportions which do not match the typical chibi exaggerated and small proportions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the figures inside the box are rendered in vibrant metallic red and black colors, they are not chibi-style figures. Chibi style typically involves exaggerated features like large heads and small bodies, which is not the case here.",

      "explanation": "Image B does show additional items like interchangeable helmets and possibly a gear base inside the packaging box, along with the robots. These items are aligned with the idea of a mini tool set, though the box's contents are not each individually detailed as tools.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, full-sized car and robot figures are displayed outside the packaging box, as seen in the foreground of the image. These figures are separate from the items contained within the box and contribute to the overall display.",
