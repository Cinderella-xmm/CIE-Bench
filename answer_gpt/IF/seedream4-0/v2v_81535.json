      "question": "Have the fresh green cilantro sprigs been replaced with tiny, ornate blue dragons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we notice the absence of the green cilantro sprigs visible in Image A. Instead, we observe tiny, ornate blue dragons occupying the area where the cilantro was. This indicates that the original cilantro has been replaced by these dragon figures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the scales of the blue dragons mirror the delicate blue floral design of the white porcelain bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scales of the blue dragons have a distinctly metallic and textured appearance, whereas the blue floral design on the bowl in both images has a flat, patterned look typical of porcelain dishware design. Although both elements are blue, their visual textures and styles are significantly different, so they do not mirror each other.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the blue dragons shown breathing faint wisps of orange curry-scented smoke?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons are seen emitting faint wisps of smoke. However, as a static image, there's no sensory element like scent that can be confirmed just by visual cues. Therefore, any smoke being curry-scented cannot be visually determined.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the chicken pieces been transformed into dragon eggs made of shimmering, solidified curry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays objects that resemble eggs with a shimmering appearance, differing from the recognizable chicken pieces in Image A. These egg-like structures appear where the chicken pieces were in Image A, suggesting a transformation into a decorative design. However, there's no solidified curry appearance or property confirmed visually.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and context of the original image been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B has significantly changed due to the replacement of cilantro with dragons and chicken with ornamental dragon eggs, along with the addition of smoke effects. These changes alter the original dish and its context but retain the same bowl and general positioning. The drastic change in subject matter affects the context while maintaining some compositional elements.",
