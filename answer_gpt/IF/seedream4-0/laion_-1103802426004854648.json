      "question": "Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse has a shiny and smooth surface that is characteristic of glass rather than the soft, textured appearance of plush fabric. The translucence and light reflections are common traits of glass objects. This suggests that the seahorse is indeed made of glass material in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse have a translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seahorse in Image B appears to have a translucent pink hue, which allows light to pass through, creating a glass-like appearance. Furthermore, there are small bubble-like textures visible on the surface, giving it an aesthetic commonly associated with decorative glass items.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the belly section made of opaque yellow glass with an etched music note design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the belly section of the seahorse is yellow and appears to be part of the translucent glass structure. While there is a pink heart with a music note on the belly, the design seems to be more of a sticker application rather than an etched design. Since the glass is translucent rather than opaque, it does not match the description provided.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins made of lavender-colored glass instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ribbons on the seahorse in Image B exhibit the same shiny and translucent qualities as the rest of the seahorse, indicating they are made of the same glass material rather than fabric. The lavender color remains consistent, but the material has changed to glass.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse is shown standing on a shiny, black stand that reflects light and appears to be metallic or glassy, typical for display stands used to showcase decorative items made of glass.",
