    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image include the apple's current front view as originally shown?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two views of the apple: a full apple and a cross-section view. The view of the full apple mirrors the full view seen in Image A. Thus, Image B does include the apple's current front view as originally shown.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a cross-section view of the apple that shows its inner flesh texture and seeds?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a cross-section of the apple, revealing the inner flesh and seeds, which is not visible in Image A that shows only a whole apple.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image contain a top view that clearly displays the apple's stem structure and calyx area?",
    "explanation": "Both the cross-section and the whole apple views in Image B do not provide a top-down perspective that clearly shows the stem's structure and the calyx area, as they are shot from a straightforward angle.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the current front view of the apple remained unchanged compared to the original image?",
    "explanation": "The view of the full apple in Image B appears unchanged compared to Image A; it is still the same perspective or angle, depicting the apple's front view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cross-section of the apple reveal both the flesh texture and seeds accurately?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cross-section view shows the inner details of the apple, including the flesh texture and seeds. This aligns with expectations based on common observations of apple cross-sections, providing an accurate depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
