        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual inspection shows that the word 'Fresh' is indeed placed in the bottom left corner. This placement aligns with typical design practices where text is often placed in the corner to not obstruct the main visual focus, which in this case are the apples. The use of a clean font suggests the intention to convey a modern and appealing message.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Sweet' is prominently displayed at the top right corner. This positioning helps balance the composition of the image and typically serves to attract attention without overshadowing the primary focus of the image, which are the apples. The choice of a clean font and discreet placement indicates an intention for a professional and uncluttered presentation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are stylized with a simple, sans-serif font that maintains a minimalist aesthetic. This design choice aims to appeal to contemporary branding styles that often favor straightforward and clean text to communicate product attributes effectively. Minimalism is popular in advertising as it provides clarity and focuses the viewer's attention on the product itself.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison between Image A and Image B shows that the primary visual elements—the apples and their environmental setting—remain consistent. There are no modifications in terms of lighting, color grading, or positioning of the apples. The only differences observed are the added text elements 'Fresh' and 'Sweet', indicating that the core visual components are unchanged.",

      "question": "Are there any additional changes besides the addition of the words \"Fresh\" and \"Sweet\" in the specified locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B in comparison to Image A, no other alterations are evident except for the inclusion of the words 'Fresh' and 'Sweet'. The apples, the background, and lighting remain identical, which implies that the sole modifications were the insertion of the text. This would suggest a focus on enhancing the image with thematic text without altering its original visual integrity.",
