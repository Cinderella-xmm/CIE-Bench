      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged into a tidy pile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar pages are spread out in a somewhat haphazard manner, overlapping each other and not arranged neatly atop one another. A tidy pile would imply a well-organized and aligned stack, which is not the case here. Therefore, the arrangement is not tidy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates still present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the notes like 'Birthday,' 'Wedding,' 'No work,' and others are visible and appear to be in the same style and location as in Image A. The highlighted dates also seem to maintain their positions and appearances, suggesting no changes have been made to them.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the calendar pages and desk surface display convincing textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the calendar pages appears to be more realistic and tactile, with the look of a slightly rough paper surface. The desk also displays a wooden texture, which is detailed and believable. This indicates a realistic depiction of textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there evidence of lighting and shadow depth creating a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows lighting effects and shadows that add depth and a three-dimensional feeling to the scene. The shadows cast by the calendar pages vary in intensity and direction, contributing to a lifelike depiction with believable lighting dynamics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the colors and styles of the handwritten notes and highlighted dates been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten notes and the highlighted dates in Image B retain the same color schemes and stylistic elements as those observed in Image A. The consistency in both color and style suggests that they have been preserved without alteration.",
