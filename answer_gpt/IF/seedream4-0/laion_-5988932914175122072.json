      "question": "Has the black handbag been transformed into a human-like female model with a defined body, posture, and facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject is a female model on a runway, wearing a form-fitting black dress. This is indicative of a transformation from the handbag in Image A to a human-like model in Image B, showing a defined body posture. The visual information in Image B suggests that the inanimate handbag has been conceptually transformed or represented by a human model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the model wear a black dress that replicates the pebbled leather texture and curved silhouette of the original handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the model's dress does not visually appear to have the pebbled leather texture seen in the handbag of Image A. However, the dress does mimic the handbag's curvature in its elegant and fitted design. The texture, though, is not pebbled and therefore doesn't fully replicate the handbag's texture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model is adorned in gold jewelry, including a necklace and bracelets, which visually complement the gold hardware of the handbag in Image A. This suggests a thematic consistency in styling between Image A and Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the MK logo is visible as a circular embellishment on the waist area of the model's dress, functioning similarly to a brooch. This aligns with the circular gold logo tag seen on the handbag in Image A.",
