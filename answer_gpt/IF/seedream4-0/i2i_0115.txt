    "Question": "Q2: Is the character's pose and facial expression identical to those in the original image?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B without considering Image A initially, the character's pose appears to be one of surprise or shock, with hands on either side of the head and mouth open.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the new battlefield background integrated seamlessly without abrupt transitions or disruptions around the character?",

Such abrupt transitions can disrupt the visual flow, revealing the edited nature of the background.",
