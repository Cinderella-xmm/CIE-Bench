    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the object now a tall, rectangular glass vessel instead of a soft-sided suitcase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a tall, rectangular vessel made of glass, as indicated by the visible transparency and reflections typical of glass materials, unlike Image A which shows a fabric suitcase. The height and shape are consistent with common glass containers rather than travel luggage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the retractable handle been transformed into a metallic spray nozzle positioned at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a metallic spray nozzle positioned at the top of the vessel, which is different from Image A that features a retractable handle typical of a suitcase. The nozzle suggests a different functionality, likely for dispensing liquid, which aligns with the characteristics of a bottle.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the side and front panels now made of translucent purple-tinted material instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side and front panels of the object in Image B appear to be made of a glass material with a purple tint, evident from the translucent and glossy appearance. In contrast, Image A has dull, opaque fabric panels typical of a suitcase.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original seam lines preserved as embossed linear patterns on the surface of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are embossed linear patterns on the glass surface of the vessel that resemble seam lines. These give a structured and segmented appearance. In Image A, seam lines are part of fabric construction but in a different material context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an etched logo near the top of the glass vessel. This is a common design feature on glass bottles to indicate branding or manufacturer information, compared to the fabric suitcase in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Have the wheels been replaced with decorative caps at the base of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the vessel has decorative caps that replace the functional wheels seen in Image A. These caps do not have the functionality of wheels and appear to be ornamental additions to the glass vessel.",
