    "Question": "Q2: Is the lighthouse inside the globe depicted as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale structure?",
    "explanation": "The lighthouse within the globe in Image B appears as a miniature 3D model, suggested by the scale comparison to the globe size. The scene is entirely contained within the globe, which suggests that all elements inside, including the lighthouse, are miniaturized to fit the dimensions of the globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama visible in the background behind the globe?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a detailed painted background visible through the transparent globe, comprising clouds and a distant mountain panorama. These elements extend beyond the framing of the globe, suggesting they are not part of the globe's miniature scene but serve as a backdrop.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the rocks inside the globe rendered in earthy tones (such as browns, tans, and greens) and the water in vibrant shades of blue?",
    "explanation": "Inside the globe in Image B, the rocks are depicted in earthy tones like browns and tans, consistent with natural rock coloration. The water surrounding the rocks and lighthouse is vividly shown in shades of blue, distinct from the stylized resin appearance of the miniature waves.",
