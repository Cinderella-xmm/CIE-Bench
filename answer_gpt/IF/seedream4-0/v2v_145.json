      "question": "Has the mango been transformed into a whimsical figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is highly stylized with a shiny, smooth surface and exaggerated angles, resembling a toy or cartoon representation rather than a natural fruit. This transformation gives it a whimsical, figurine-like appearance. In contrast, Image A shows a realistic depiction of a fresh mango with natural texture.",

      "question": "Have the cut mango pieces been slightly increased in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango pieces appear to be larger and more pronounced in their cubic shape compared to those in Image A. This is due to the stylized art design, where each cube is well-defined and exaggerated in size, giving the impression of increased size.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mango pieces have a shiny 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mango pieces in Image B are rendered with a glossy finish and reflections, giving them a shiny 3D effect as if made from plastic or a highly polished material. This contrasts with the more matte and natural appearance of the mango pieces in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the lime and chili powder bowl have a cartoon-like design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the lime and the chili powder bowl display cartoon characteristics. The lime shows a winking face, and the bowl has a face with expressive eyes, which are typical of cartoon designs. This is a departure from Image A, where these items have a realistic presentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the setup against a background that resembles a shelf, with visible horizontal surfaces and other items slightly blurred in the background. This contrasts with Image A, where the setup is on a wooden surface without any visible shelf context.",
