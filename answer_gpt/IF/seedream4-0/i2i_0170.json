      "question": "Are the overall lines and contours of the image now clear and well-defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines and contours are drawn in a stylized manner typical of illustrations. The outlines of the figures, the bags, and the mannequins are sharply defined and prominent. This is a common characteristic of vector art or illustrations, where clarity of outline is emphasized to create a clear and recognizable structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the original textures been replaced with soft gradient blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed textures seen in Image A, like fabric textures or the subtle gradients of skin, are no longer present. Instead, the use of flat colors is more prominent, and any color transitions are executed using soft gradients, which replace the original detailed textures to give the image a smoother appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image now exhibit characteristics of a high-end commercial illustration (e.g., refined and sophisticated appearance)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a style typically used in high-end commercial illustrations, with its clean lines, simplified forms, and use of sophisticated color palettes. Such illustrations are often seen in fashion magazines, such as 'Vogue', known for their elegant and polished presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges and boundaries between elements in the image now sharply defined and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each element, like the clothing on the figures, bags, and the mannequins, is distinctly separated by crisp and clear lines. This characteristic is typical of stylized illustrations, where precision in demarcating different elements is vital for a clean and professional look.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do areas previously filled with detailed textures now feature smooth, soft gradients instead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation of Image B, areas that might have had detailed texturing in Image A are transformed into regions of solid colors or subtle gradients. These gradients change softly across the surfaces, replacing the intricate textures with a more uniform and gently transitioning color scheme.",
