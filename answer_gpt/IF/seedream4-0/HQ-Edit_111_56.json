    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the ballerina depicted as a stone sculpture rather than a living person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stone sculpture characterized by its marble texture, and sculpting details that differ from any depiction of a living person. The rigidness and monochromatic color of the structure signify it is a sculpture rather than a living entity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ballerina's garments replaced with intricately folded, draping robes characteristic of classical Greek attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garments in Image B are depicted as intricately folded and draped robes, which are reminiscent of classical Greek clothing. This is evident from the flowing and layered nature that mimics ancient Greek robes, rather than the tutu and tight garments seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a stylized laurel wreath on her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a laurel wreath on the figure’s head, which is a typical accessory in classical ancient Greek depictions, often symbolizing victory or special status. This stylistic element is clear from the visual evidence in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the figure maintaining the same ballet pose (on pointe, arms extended) as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure maintains one leg forward in walking motion rather than being on pointe, and the arms appear to be freely hanging as opposed to being formally extended, which signifies a posture change. Thus, the figure does not retain the ballet position shown in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure’s surface display a marble-like texture with visible chisel marks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a marble-like texture, evident from its pale color and stone appearance, consistent with sculptural art. However, the texture does not show visible chisel marks, which are typically more prominent in unfinished sculptures. The overall surface in Image B appears smooth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there Ionic columns present in the background of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features columns with the recognizable characteristics of Ionic architecture, such as the scroll-like volutes at the top and fluting down the shaft, which are distinctive of this style. The presence of such columns aligns with classical ancient Greek structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the floor beneath the figure composed of a mosaic pattern made of small colored tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a mosaic floor, visible through the arrangement and color variance of tiles that form elaborate geometric and artistic designs. This type of flooring is common in ancient Greek and Roman architecture, represented here by the small colored tiles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the scene include only historically accurate elements consistent with an ancient Greek temple setting, without modern or out-of-place objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B present historically accurate elements such as the marble sculpture, draped clothing, laurel wreath, Ionic columns, and mosaic flooring, all typical of ancient Greek temple architecture. There are no visible modern elements included in the scene.",
