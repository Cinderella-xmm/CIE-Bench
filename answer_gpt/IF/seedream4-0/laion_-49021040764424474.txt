    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, as is evident from the characteristic blocky texture of the pieces. The bricks used are primarily in orange, with black and silver accents, creating the truck's body. This indicates that LEGO bricks have been employed to replicate the truck's structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
    "explanation": "The wheels in Image B appear to be made from circular LEGO pieces with a distinct LEGO texture, taking on a generally gray color. This resembles a construction from LEGO pieces, replacing the standard rubber tire and metal rim typically seen in vehicles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed is created using LEGO bricks with notable studs on top, suggesting a typical LEGO surface rather than a perfectly smooth finish. The presence of visible studs indicates that the truck bed is not covered in completely smooth black LEGO tiles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it above the ground?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO truck resting on what appears to be a plain white, solid base or platform, distinct from the ground setting visible in the background. This suggests that the platform serves as a shelf or stand function to elevate the model.",
