      "question": "Does the teddy bear have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear appears with distinct geometric shapes, such as triangles and polygons, giving it a faceted low-poly look. This appearance contrasts with a smooth or realistic model and aligns with the low-poly style often seen in 3D modeling or gaming graphics.",

      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motorcycle in Image B has been rendered with geometric shapes that create a faceted, low-poly look, similar to that of the teddy bear. This results in a more abstract and stylized version of the original motorcycle design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scenic background rendered in a low-poly style while still being recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has been stylized with a low-poly appearance, where natural elements like the mountain and sky are depicted using flat, geometric shapes. Despite the stylization, the mountain's iconic shape remains identifiable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the teddy bear retained its original pose and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose and position of the teddy bear remain consistent between Image A and Image B. The low-poly editing style does not affect the bear's posture or its relative placement on the motorcycle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite being edited into a low-poly style, the motorcycle in Image B maintains the same design features, such as its shape and structure, and remains in the same position as in Image A.",
