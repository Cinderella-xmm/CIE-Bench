      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate the presence of noticeable brushstrokes across the entire image. These strokes are visible in elements such as the walls, furniture, painting, and other objects. This is characteristic of post-impressionistic painting techniques, which emphasize texture and movement through brushwork. In Image A, the original image portrays a smooth and realistic texture, typical of photography, which contrasts with the brushstroke texture in Image B.",

      "question": "Are there distinct, exaggerated differences between light and dark areas in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases prominent contrasts between light and dark areas, particularly noticeable in the shadows on the wall and the difference between the bright sky and darker landscapes in the painting. Such stark contrast enhances the dynamic feel of the image, which aligns with artistic styles that emphasize dramatic lighting. Comparing this with Image A, where the lighting is more evenly distributed and natural, Image B possesses more intense differences, resulting in a dramatic and artistic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elements within the edited image, such as the sky, clouds, and landscape, display swirling patterns or dynamic lines characteristic of Van Gogh's style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features swirling patterns and dynamic lines, particularly in the wall texture and the sky within the painting, reminiscent of Van Gogh's distinctive style found in works like 'Starry Night'. This style involves energetic and swirling strokes that impart movement and emotion. In contrast, Image A presents these elements with more realism and calmness, without swirling patterns, sticking to a photographic representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are vivid and expressive, significantly diverging from realistic palettes. They exhibit intensity with vibrant blues and yellows throughout the scene, similar to the color usage seen in Van Gogh's paintings. Image A embodies a more subdued and natural coloring typical of a real-life setting. The edited image demonstrates a shift towards a more expressive, artistic color treatment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is styled consistently with the artistic techniques of Van Gogh. The element of visible brushstrokes, swirling patterns, vibrant colors, and stark light contrasts reflect his post-impressionistic style. Compared to Image A, which has a standard realistic appearance, the edited image captures the artistic essence reminiscent of Van Gogh's work throughout its entirety, maintaining coherence with his iconic techniques.",
