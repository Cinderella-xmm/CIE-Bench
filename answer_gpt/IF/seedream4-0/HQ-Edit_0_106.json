      "question": "Is the lion rendered as a high-contrast silhouette with minimal internal detail and strong edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is presented as a silhouette. This means it has been rendered in a single dark color without internal details, only showing its outline with strong, clear edges. This style is consistent with a high-contrast silhouette, where the form of the subject is defined by its edge rather than internal shading or texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an abstract gradient composed of smooth color transitions rather than a realistic savannah landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that lacks the detailed, naturalistic elements of a savannah landscape. Instead, it has smooth transitions and gradients of gray, which suggest an abstract style rather than realistic scenery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are detailed grass textures clearly visible in the foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass is depicted as part of the silhouette-style imagery, without intricate details. The grass appears as a series of lines and shapes with black and white contrast. This confirms that detailed textures are not present; instead, they are represented abstractly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the acacia trees depicted as angular, stylized silhouettes with sharp edges and geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The acacia trees in Image B are shown as silhouettes with angular forms and sharp edges. Their depiction is stylized, lacking the intricate, organic detail they usually possess, instead focusing on geometric forms consistent with silhouette art.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"King of the Wild\" displayed in a dramatic, bold typeface across the upper section of the image without overpowering the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'King of the Wild' is prominently displayed across the upper part of the image. It uses a bold, dramatic typeface that ensures visibility and impact, but it's positioned and sized in a way that doesn't divert attention from the lion, which remains the focal point.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned centrally and visually dominant in the composition, ensuring it remains the primary focus despite other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion occupies a central position within the composition. As a silhouette, it remains visually dominant despite other elements like text and background, ensuring that it is the primary focus of the image.",
