      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly situated within a glass container, which resembles a terrarium. This can be determined by observing the curved, transparent glass walls visible around the entire scene. The presence of reflections and a distortion effect, common in glass objects, further supports the conclusion that the scene is enclosed within a glass terrarium.",

      "question": "Are the snow-capped peaks made of visibly textured and glittering materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-capped peaks have a distinctive glittery appearance, resembling materials like glitter or sequins. The texture is evident from the way the peaks catch and reflect light, adding a synthetic and decorative quality, which is not typical of natural snow but instead suggests a crafted, sparkly material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the landscape feature intricately detailed, fine-brushed foliage instead of natural-looking vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foliage in Image B appears highly detailed and crafted, similar to miniature models or dioramas. Each tree and shrub has a precise, stylized appearance that suggests they were individually crafted, likely using fine-brush techniques. This level of detail and artistic expression is different from what is usually observed in natural vegetation, which is less uniform and more irregular.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lake represented by a reflective, translucent resin-like surface with a synthetic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B has a surface that looks smooth, glossy, and highly reflective, similar to resin or acrylic surfaces used in crafting and modeling. The uniform reflection and the way the light interacts with this surface give it a synthetic appearance rather than a naturally occurring water body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed chalet figurines placed along the shoreline of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small chalet-like structures along the lake's shoreline. These look like miniature models or figurines, each with detailed elements such as roofs and windows. Their deliberate arrangement and attention to detail indicate they are intended to represent chalets in a scaled-down landscape scene.",
