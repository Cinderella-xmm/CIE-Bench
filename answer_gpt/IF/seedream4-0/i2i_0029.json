      "question": "Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes extend into the ground, forming a continuous pattern that resembles the zebra's natural stripes. Analyzing the image, the grass appears to intertwine within the stripes, giving the impression of a seamless extension of the zebra's stripes into the surrounding environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the grassland rendered in a black-and-white striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground where the zebra stands features a distinct black-and-white striped pattern that resembles the zebra's stripes. This pattern is not typical of natural grassland and represents a creative and artistic rendering, persuading that the ground itself is designed as a continuation of the zebra's stripe motif.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image creates a visual merger of the zebra's stripes with the ground, transforming the normal grassland into a continuation of the zebra's markings. This blending of the animal with its environment in such a stylized and imaginative manner typifies surrealistic imagery, which adds an artistic and creative element to the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the transition between the zebra's stripes and the patterned ground appears smooth and continuous. The blending of the stripes into the ground does not show any interruptions or breaks, suggesting a deliberate artistic integration rather than an abrupt shift.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the zebra's original body proportion been maintained despite the extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the zebra retains its natural body proportion, despite the creative alteration of the environment in Image B. The zebra's shape and size remain consistent, showing that the changes only affect the background rather than altering its physical structure.",
