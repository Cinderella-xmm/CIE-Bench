    "Question": "Q1: Is the ballet dancer's pose represented as two distinct sticker versions in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two sticker versions of the ballet dancer, each seemingly identical in pose but differing in size.

    "Question": "Q2: Does one of the stickers use a pastel color scheme with soft gradients and gentle tones to convey grace?",
    "explanation": "Both stickers in Image B exhibit a soft color palette dominated by muted pinks, whites, and light purples. However, they do not employ soft gradients or a tone transition typical of pastel color schemes; instead, they use flat colors. This suggests a more uniform appearance rather than the soft illuminative quality associated with pastel colors.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are there visible detachable or segmented sections around the dancer's leg in at least one of the stickers to enable dynamic layering?",

    "answer": "No"
