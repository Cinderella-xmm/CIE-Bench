      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The models in the travel case diorama, visible in Image B, display characteristics of detailed craftsmanship typical of miniatures.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground covering in the diorama appears to mimic grass, yet it has a distinct textured appearance that reflects light differently from natural grass, suggesting a resin-like or synthetic finishâ€”a common technique used in dioramas for durability and artistic effect.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of an acacia tree in Image B provides visual scale within the diorama alongside the elephant. This tree, positioned on the right side within the case, assists in establishing a balanced miniature environment often used in such scaled models to create an authentic savannah scene.",
