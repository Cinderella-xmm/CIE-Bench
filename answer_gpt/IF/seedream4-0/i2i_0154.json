      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are multiple viewpoints of the same car presented. The image includes a side view at two angles and a top view, which are typically part of a car blueprint or design presentation. There is no visible front view included. Based on the typical interpretation of different car views, a front view would showcase the car from directly ahead, displaying features like the grille and headlights, which are not present in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are two depictions of the car showcasing its lateral or side profile. These side view images clearly display the vehicle's length, door, side mirrors, and wheels, which are characteristic of side views in automotive design presentations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) includes a depiction of the sports car from an overhead perspective. This top view illustrates the outline of the car, including the roof, the front hood, and the silhouette of the windshield, which is typical in vehicle blueprints or layout designs for accurate representation of the vehicle's roof and body structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) incorporates different views of the car, specifically the side and top views, into one single layout. A front view is absent, but the side and top views are presented alongside each other within the same image, which is a common format for design layouts or technical drawings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays the car from various angles, clearly and with attention to scale, which makes the details of the vehicle easily discernible. The presentation of multiple views in a cohesive and precise manner suggests a professional attempt at showcasing the car, likely suitable for design reviews or educational purposes. The clarity and arrangement reflect an understanding of automotive design presentation standards.",
