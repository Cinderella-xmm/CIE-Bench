        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects that seem to resemble perfume bottles are gold-finished and are in a seated posture.

The details, such as the smooth surfaces and the metallic finish, are indicative of perfume bottles rather than traditional figures.",
