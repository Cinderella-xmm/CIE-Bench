      "question": "Are the topiary structures transformed into sentient plant creatures with visible facial features or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the topiary structures are transformed into figures resembling sentient plant creatures. They appear to have human-like forms intertwined with foliage, though their facial features are not defined, leaving it more to imagination whether they exhibit a human-like appearance. However, the overall transformation from topiary to creature-like figures with plant elements is evident.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
