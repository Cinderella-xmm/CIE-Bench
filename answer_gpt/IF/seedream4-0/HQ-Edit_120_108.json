      "question": "Are cogs and gears visibly integrated into the armature of the brass lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armature of the brass lamp showcases visible cogs and gears, aligning with a steampunk aesthetic. This observation is drawn from the visible mechanical components integrated into the lamp's design, which contrasts with traditional lamp designs. The edited image displays these features prominently, suggesting an intentional enhancement for thematic purposes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pages of the open book show detailed designs resembling mechanical schematics, including diagrams and shapes akin to cogs and gears. This indicates a departure from typical text or illustration-heavy pages, emphasizing a steampunk or mechanical design theme. The presence of such designs is visually evident when observed closely.",

      "question": "Are rivet patterns present on the floral wallpaper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, rivet patterns are visible not on the floral wallpaper itself but rather on the border or frame surrounding the setting. These rivets contribute to the steampunk design theme by introducing industrial visual elements without altering the floral wallpaper directly.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly features warm tones, including brass, brown, and amber, consistent with a vintage aesthetic. These tones are visible in the lamp, book, and the surrounding environment, creating a cohesive color palette that aligns with themes of antiquity and leather-and-brass style. This palette is intentional to enhance the thematic representation of the edited image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the lamp casts a focused beam of light directly onto the open book, illuminating the pages effectively. This setup ensures that the focal point of the light remains consistent, suggesting the maintained integrity of the original design's intention regarding lighting.",
