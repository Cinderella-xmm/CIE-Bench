      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presentation consists of soft colors with a mix of light washes, characteristic of watercolor painting.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman in the foreground maintains a clearer form with evident detail in texture and garment patterns, while the background figures and objects are depicted with lighter washes and less detail. This prioritizes the foreground, creating a sense of focus on her.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background figures in Image B are outlined softly and filled with gentle washes, lacking intricate detail, which contrasts with the more precise depiction of the foreground woman. This artistic choice emphasizes the watercolor style further, where backgrounds are often less detailed.",
