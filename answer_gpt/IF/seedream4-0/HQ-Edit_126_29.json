      "question": "Is the room visually transformed into a thematic infographic with Victorian literature elements, including layout and design consistent with an educational or narrative display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the room is transformed with textual and visual elements consistent with Victorian literature themes. The layout includes a large book cover illustration, text snippets, and a headline 'Secrets of Time', which suggest an educational or narrative theme. These additions create a thematic infographic appearance, characteristic of presentations focused on storytelling or conveying information.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the clock face been replaced with a visual representation of a book with animated or implied page-turning motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is overshadowed by an illustration of an open book resting on top of it, which implies the act of reading or narrating a story but does not appear to show an animated or implied motion of page-turning. Instead, the presence of the open book is a static addition to the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible text snippets on the wallpaper that detail historical milestones in timekeeping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are text snippets visible across the wallpaper area to the left of the clock, beneath the headline, and alongside the book. While these text snippets are present, it cannot definitively be determined from the image alone that they describe historical milestones in timekeeping, as they appear more decorative without clear readable historical content.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the framed artwork above the fireplace now display an image of an ancient sundial instead of a landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the framed artwork has been edited to display an image resembling an ancient sundial, replacing the original serene landscape scene. The circular design with lines is indicative of a sundial, aligning with the theme modifications towards timekeeping.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock hands visibly designed as stylized pens, incorporated into the book cover illustration on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face does not exhibit designs transforming the clock hands into stylized pens. Instead, there is a large book illustration placed in front of the original clock, which features pens as part of its design. However, these pens are a part of the book cover and do not act as clock hands, as the clock itself is obscured.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there captions visible in the room using elegant serif fonts with art-nouveau stylistic elements such as flourishes or organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are numerous captions and text in elegant serif fonts visible across the layout, particularly around the book and beneath the headline. These text additions incorporate stylistic elegance reminiscent of art-nouveau, with curves and flourishes suggesting an artistic and refined presentation.",
