    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky exhibits features typical of a plush toy: a simplified and stylized design, soft and smooth textures, and distinctively rounded limbs that lack articulation similar to those in stuffed animals. World knowledge about plush toys suggests they are designed for softness, often with exaggerated features to emphasize cuteness or approachability.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paws in Image B are rounded, disproportionately large compared to the body, and lack the detail and individual definition found in live animals, suggesting a design choice typical for plush toys to enhance cuteness and handling comfort.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture in Image B appears uniformly smooth and velvety, characteristic of fabric used in plush toys, instead of the varied, realistic fur texture seen in live animals. This matches the design where plush toys are usually made with smooth fabric for touch comfort.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and other facial features appear simplified and stylized, similar to embroidery or sewn-on details, rather than the intricate, expressive features of a real animal. This approach is common in plush toys to maintain durability and a friendly appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the husky plush toy seated on a flat, wooden surface, which resembles a shelf. The clean and unadorned presentation is typical of display or storage shelves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background minimalist, without any natural elements like snow, trees, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is plain and lacks any elements such as snow, trees, or sky. This minimalist setting draws attention solely to the plush toy, which is further emphasized on an indoor, simple wooden surface.",
