      "question": "Does the edited version contain exactly three distinct art postcards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays three separate postcards, each with unique imagery and borders. The top two postcards feature detailed imagery of the woman and colorful borders, while the third one at the bottom presents a silhouetted figure against a landscape. All these observations indicate that there are exactly three distinct postcards in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a postcard showing the woman leaning against a straw hut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top left postcard depicts the woman standing in front of what appears to be a straw structure. The visual similarity to a hut is drawn from the straw texture and structure behind the woman, which is typical of huts in certain cultures. This indicates that the postcard features the woman in relation to a straw hut.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a postcard where the woman's beaded jewelry is represented in an abstract, non-realistic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top right postcard in Image B shows the woman's jewelry in a highly stylized and vibrant manner, focusing on colors and patterns rather than realistic detail. This representation aligns with an abstract, non-realistic art style, emphasizing artistic interpretation rather than photographic accuracy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom postcard in Image B shows the silhouette of a woman set against a background that appears to be a digitally created grassy landscape, identifiable by bright and unnatural colors, as well as pixelated details typical of digital rendering. These elements confirm the presence of a digitally rendered grassy landscape.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each postcard in Image B features very bright and vivid color schemes. Additionally, they all have geometric borders, which can be observed in the form of colored shapes encircling each image. These features consistently appear across all three postcards.",
