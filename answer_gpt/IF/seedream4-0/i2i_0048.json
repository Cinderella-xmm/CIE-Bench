        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the contrast appears to be noticeably enhanced. The zebra in the foreground displays sharper and more distinct black and white stripes, and the metallic appearance suggests a high-contrast manipulation. Additionally, the grass has a vividness that suggests increased contrast compared to typical natural scenery. These visual cues indicate a likely enhancement in contrast.",

      "question": "Is there visible improvement in the sharpness of zebras and the grassy ground in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras show enhanced sharpness, especially evident in the metallic appearance of the zebra on the left. The distinct lines and reflections on the zebra suggest that not just contrast but also sharpness might have been improved. However, since the metallic texture is artificially introduced, it is hard to attribute the sharpness accurately. For the grassy ground, it does not look significantly sharper than typical due to the natural texture being less defined further back but improved compared to the fuzzy background.",

      "question": "Are the natural textures of the zebras' stripes and the grassland detailed and clear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are clear, but they appear metallic rather than natural, which means there is a change in texture representation. The use of a metal-like surface changes how light and details are perceived, affecting the perception of 'natural' textures. The grassland retains a reasonably natural look but is not as detailed as the foreground zebra image. Therefore, the natural textures of the zebra are not detailed and clear in a typical sense.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows structures resembling buildings in the distance, which were not a feature in grassland contexts typically associated with wildlife photography. These buildings may suggest an urban environment. Thus, it seems urban elements have been added to the scene, supporting a city life aesthetic.",

      "question": "Has the original composition of the zebras in the grassland been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the basic composition of the zebras in the grassland has been preserved, as they occupy a similar position relative to one another and the environment. While there are alterations to textures and contrast in Image B, the spatial arrangement of elements remains unchanged from a compositional standpoint.",
