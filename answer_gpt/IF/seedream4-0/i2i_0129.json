      "question": "Has the surfboard been replaced with a giant manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is clearly still standing on a traditional surfboard situated on a wave. A giant manta ray is flying above the surfer, but it has not replaced the surfboard. Therefore, the surfboard's presence remains unaltered and visible as part of the image composition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfer in Image B maintains the same posture as in Image A, still balancing on the surfboard amidst the waves. The manta ray is a new addition and appears above the surfer, leaving the original surfing posture and interaction with the surfboard unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features visual elements that contribute to a dreamy atmosphere, such as the soft, glowing edges around the manta ray and the overall gentle lighting, which add a surreal quality to the scene. These effects create a more ethereal ambience compared to the straightforward look of Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the manta ray is portrayed as an enormous creature soaring above the surfer, not beneath. It occupies a substantial portion of the sky, contributing to the surreal nature of the scene. The depiction emphasizes the manta ray's size compared to the surfer, but it is not below the surfer.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the addition of dreamy effects, both the surfer and the manta ray are clearly visible and identifiable. The surfer maintains a distinct silhouette against the ocean backdrop, and the manta ray's shape and details are prominent against the sky, making both figures easily recognizable.",
