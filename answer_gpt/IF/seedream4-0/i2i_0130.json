        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment features stone walls, a gothic-style vaulted ceiling, and ornate stone carvings around the fireplace, which are characteristic elements of a medieval castle hall. In comparison, Image A depicts a modern, cozy library with bookshelves and wooden paneling. These distinct differences, especially the use of heavy stone materials and decorative details typical of medieval architecture in Image B, indicate that the setting has been changed to resemble a medieval castle hall.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace is surrounded by elaborate stone carvings and has a more monumental and decorative design, which is grander than the simple, traditional wooden mantel found in Image A.
