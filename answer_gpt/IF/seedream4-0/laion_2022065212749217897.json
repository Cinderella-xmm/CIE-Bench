      "question": "Is the character's head significantly larger than the body, consistent with chibi-style proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the character is noticeably larger in proportion to the body, which is a hallmark of chibi-style illustrations.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the facial features are not visible due to the pixelation, we can infer from typical chibi representations that if it were visible, the features would be exaggerated. However, the analysis based on Image B alone does not allow for confirmation without the visibility of these features.",
