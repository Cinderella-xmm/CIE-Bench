        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is clearly drawn in a cartoon style characterized by simplified and exaggerated features, such as large eyes and a simplified hand with the fingers grasping the guitar in a stylized manner.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
