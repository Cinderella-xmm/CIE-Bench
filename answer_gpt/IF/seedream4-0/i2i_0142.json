      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top left section shows a view looking directly down into the glove with the baseball inside. This viewpoint is considered a top view because it captures the layout and design of the glove's interior, which can only be seen from above.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom right section of the image shows the baseball glove from the side, capturing its width and the shape of its opening. This view, focused on the glove's side profile, is a classic side view.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a sectional view that would typically show an internal cut-away to reveal the internal structure of the objects. All views are external, showing distinct parts but not any cross-sectional cuts.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The views in Image B provide clear details of the glove's construction and the baseball's surface, using well-defined visuals that are typical for product presentations. However, the text is not legible, which is a common requirement for catalogs to provide product details.",
