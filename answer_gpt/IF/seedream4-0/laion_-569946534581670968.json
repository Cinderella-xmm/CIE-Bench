      "question": "Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects that would ordinarily be recognized as chicken wings are shaped similarly to real chicken wings but possess a distinctly fabric-like appearance, particularly a soft and fluffy look consistent with plush toys. The fabric is golden-brown, matching the color of traditional fried chicken wings, but lacks any indication of true crunchy texture as exhibited in real food. This implies a focus on plush material rather than an actual crunchy feeling.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sauce replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object located in the area where one would expect sauce resembles a square-shaped plush item, characterized by its soft and padded appearance. The color is bright orange, which suggests an intentional design to mimic a sauce's typical hue, but the form and texture are emblematic of a soft pillow. Visually, it is more akin to a small cushion than any edible substance.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene set on a smooth, light-colored wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the table or background surface is smooth and light wood-toned. This visual familiarity aligns with common wooden surfaces, which are typically characterized by a light, even finish, likely to create an aesthetic and neutral backdrop for the food or items in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the plush wings and the orange pillow arranged in the same spatial configuration as the original chicken wings and sauce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the arrangement in Image B to that of Image A, both configurations maintain a similar orientation and spatial relationship among the components. The plush plush wings closely mimic the positions and layout of the chicken wings, and the orange pillow occupies the place where the sauce resided, thus following the same overall arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the plush wings and pillow clearly appear as fabric-based toys rather than real food items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual consistency suggests that what resembles chicken wings and sauce in form, instead appear expressly like stuffed or plush objects, characterized by their soft, fabric textures and structured forms that are not found in real food items. These visual cues unambiguously indicate they are fabric-based toys rather than any form of edible material.",
