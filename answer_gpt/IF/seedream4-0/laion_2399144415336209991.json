        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple is illustrated with cartoon-like features. Cartoons often employ simplified and exaggerated forms that include oversized heads, large eyes, and generalized body shapes. The cleaned lines and flat colors further reinforce this cartoon style. Therefore, the depiction in Image B indeed aligns with cartoon-style exaggeration.",
