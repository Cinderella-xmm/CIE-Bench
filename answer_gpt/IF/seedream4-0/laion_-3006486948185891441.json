      "question": "Is the horse sculpture enclosed in a transparent box that allows full visibility of its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse sculpture is shown inside a transparent box with clear sides, allowing the form of the sculpture to be fully visible. This is evident through the clarity of the image where no parts of the sculpture are obscured. The transparent material of the box provides an unobstructed view of the entire sculpture.",

      "question": "Are there visible gold-colored decorative elements or trim on the transparent showcase box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the corners and other elements of the transparent box are accentuated with gold-colored trim. These decorative elements are prominently visible and provide an element of elegance to the showcase, contrasting against the transparent material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a modern and elegantly designed brand logo visible on the black base stand beneath the showcase box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a brand logo is visible on the surface of the transparent box rather than the base stand, which might lead to confusion. However, there isn't a discernible logo on the black base specifically that invokes the modern and elegant design criteria directly stated in the question.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the transparent box in Image B, there is a golden textured backdrop featuring intricate patterns that resemble traditional Chinese motifs. This backdrop gives a decorative context to the sculpture, reinforcing the cultural aesthetics of ancient Chinese art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the box appears to be neatly assembled, there are visible gold-colored corner elements that suggest a decorative trim and may also function as part of a closure mechanism. There is no explicit evidence of a magnetic closure as opposed to visible latching mechanisms.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
