      "question": "Are the collectibles depicted as exquisitely detailed 3D-rendered figures of a bee and a flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee and flower figures are presented within a box and appear to be three-dimensional, with notable details and finishes. The bee has sparkling wings and glossy stripes, while the flower has an intricate design and texture, suggesting a 3D-rendered appearance. By utilizing common knowledge about collectible figures often aiming for realism and high detail, the figures are indeed depicted in a detailed manner. Comparing this with Image A, the figures are stylized pins on a card, which are less detailed and flat.",

      "question": "Is the display box pastel-colored with a soft cream finish and delicate gold trims?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a box that is light-colored with a creamy appearance, consistent with a pastel tone. The box features subtle gold trims enhancing the elegance of the presentation. Recognizing world knowledge of pastel tones being soft and muted, the description aligns with the box's appearance in Image B. In contrast, Image A does not feature a box, thus this aspect is unique to Image B.",

      "question": "Are the bee and flower figures arranged side by side within the box, embodying harmony and friendship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the bee and flower collectibles are placed next to each other in the display box, which suggests an intentional placement as often seen with paired objects denoting harmony and companionship. Such arrangements are common in product designs emphasizing unity or complementary characteristics. Image A has the bee and flower pins side by side on a card, although the flat presentation does not convey the same depth of meaning or intentional arrangement as in the box of Image B.",

      "question": "Does the bee figurine have vibrant, glossy yellow and black stripes along with sparkling, semi-translucent wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee collectible is detailed with bright yellow and glossy black stripes. Its wings appear to be semi-translucent and have a sparkling effect, creating a visually vibrant and eye-catching design. This aligns with jewelry or finely crafted collectibles where such effects add allure and realism. Image A shows a bee pin, which has solid color stripes and lacks the sparkling wing effect, offering a flatter appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lid of the box in Image B indeed has the inscription “ETERNITY BLOSSOM” surrounded by delicate stars and floral graphics, which enhances the aesthetic and thematic link to nature and elegance. Such inscribed designs are typical of luxury or themed packaging. Image A presents the phrase on a card with straightforward lines and lacks additional designs, showing basic branding without embellishment.",
