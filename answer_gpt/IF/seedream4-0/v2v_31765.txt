    "Question": "Q1: Have the vegetables and knife been broken down into geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables and knife appear to be stylized using geometric shapes such as cubes and polygons. This geometric abstraction is evident from the faceted, angular appearance of the objects rather than smooth or rounded edges. This suggests the intention to break down the natural forms into simplified geometrical components, consistent with certain artistic styles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the vegetables and knife organized in a manner that emphasizes geometric forms but maintains the original arrangement as seen in Image A. The abstraction lies in the visual texture and aesthetic, which utilizes geometric shapes, but the arrangement itself is not significantly altered into an abstract form (such as a non-representational composition).",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?",
    "explanation": "Despite the abstraction in Image B, the forms of the carrots, celery, onions, and the knife are still distinguishable. The colors, positioning, and general shape are retained well enough to recognize these items as vegetables and a knife. This recognition is aided by common visual cues like size, relative positioning, and color that correspond to the items' everyday presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains a full color palette similar to Image A, with the vibrant colors of the vegetables intact. Cubist styles often involve a more limited, monochromatic palette to emphasize form over color, but Image B does not demonstrate this characteristic simplification of color.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?",
    "explanation": "Image B, while using geometric abstraction, does not exhibit the typical Cubist features of overlapping planes or multiple perspectives. The objects remain in a single coherent perspective, without showing different angles or intersecting planes. This indicates a geometric abstraction more aligned with stylistic features rather than the complex interplay of perspectives seen in Cubism.",
    "answer": "No"
