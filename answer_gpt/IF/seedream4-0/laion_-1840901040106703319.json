      "question": "Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a structure composed of geometric, transparent surfaces akin to a faceted crystal, which contrasts with the log cabin seen in Image A. Given the clear disparity between a conventional wooden log cabin and a modern, geometric crystal design, the answer reflects the significant transformation in structure style and material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a structure with exterior surfaces made of transparent, faceted planes that visibly reflect or refract light in blue and green hues. This is understood through visual cues where light interactions create colorful reflections on the surface, showcasing a spectrum much different than the wooden exterior in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it becomes clear that the wooden beams and supports characteristic of a log cabin are absent and instead replaced by crystal edges. This conclusion is drawn by noticing the absence of any typical wooden structures and the presence of crystal surfaces and angles that mimic structural support.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the geometric crystal structure placed upon a flat, white marble platform, discernible through the distinct texture and color associated with marble. Marble is a common material used for aesthetic platforms and the coherent white surface seen underneath the structure supports the conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small crystal formations present as decorative accents along the base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, alongside the larger crystal structure, several smaller crystal formations are present along its base, adding decorative elements which are visually noticeable. This analysis stems from recognizing patterns akin to decorations used in modern architecture using crystal-like materials differing from the wooden elements in Image A.",
