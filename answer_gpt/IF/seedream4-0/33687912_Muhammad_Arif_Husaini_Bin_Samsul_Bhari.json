    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the silhouetted boat and riders replaced by a mythical ocean guardian creature that is clearly distinguishable from a regular boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large and vividly colored creature floating above the water with a shell-like body and appendages, which is unlike any traditional boat form. Image A shows only a boat with riders silhouetted against the sunset. The presence of a fantasy creature indicates a distinct difference from the original boat in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the creature feature a shell-like body composed of sunset-colored hues (orange, red, yellow)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's body is prominently shell-like and exhibits colors that blend with the surrounding sunset, with dominant orange, red, and yellow hues. This aligns closely with the color scheme typically found in sunsets.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there coral-like spires visibly extending along the back of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has distinct protrusions or structures on its back that visually resemble coral spires. These features extend upward, adding a more intricate and fantastical element to the creature's design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the riders been replaced with glowing, spirit-like figures that emit light and resemble sea guardians?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, atop the creature's shell, there are bright, luminous figures that do not resemble typical human riders but rather take on an ethereal, glowing appearance. They resemble mythical guardians more than regular people, which is unlike the silhouettes seen in Image A.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the water trail been replaced with glowing, wave-like patterns that match the color gradient of the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water shows iridescent, glowing patterns that mimic the fluidity of waves and reflect the colors seen in the sunset. The original Image A contained no such luminous patterns, indicating an enhancement in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the mythical creature positioned in the same location as the original boat, near the center of the lower half of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show a central object located near the horizon and relatively central in the composition. Image A has the boat in this position, while Image B has the creature placed in a similar location, suggesting intentional alignment with the original composition.",
