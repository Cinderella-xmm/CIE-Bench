      "question": "Does the figurine appear to be made of polished wood, with visible wood grain and a smooth, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine distinctly appears to be made from wood. This is evidenced by the visible wood grain patterns throughout its body, suggesting a natural wooden material. The surface seems smooth and exhibits a sheen typical of polished wood. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge of polished wood characteristics, confirm that the material is indeed wood, with its reflective qualities indicating a polished finish.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black and white areas of the dog's fur represented using contrasting natural wood tones (dark vs. light)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine exhibits areas of contrasting tones. The darker areas of the dog's 'fur' are represented by a deep, rich wood color, possibly simulating black, while the lighter fur sections are portrayed with a much paler wood tone, simulating white. This deliberate choice in wood tones effectively mimics the contrast seen in black and white fur, translating the original coloration into a wooden context.",

      "question": "Do the figurine’s contours appear smooth and rounded, avoiding sharp or angular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the contours of the figurine are notably smooth and rounded. The transitions between different parts of the figurine, such as ears, face, and body, are without sharp angles, which aligns with the typical characteristics of carved wooden figures meant to convey a more organic, cohesive form. This design choice ensures that the figure maintains a soft and approachable appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth enhanced with visible fine carved lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are rendered with distinct finesse. However, the smooth wooden texture and the craftsmanship style do not emphasize fine carved lines for the facial features but instead rely on the inherent shadows and wood grain to add depth and definition to these areas. Hence, the enhancement doesn't come from fine lines but from the natural characteristics of wood and shading practices.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figurine placed on a minimalist wooden platform that matches the carving style and material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the figurine on a wooden platform that complements the figurine's material and aesthetic. The platform itself displays a simple, minimalist design, with a wood texture that harmonizes with the figurine’s material. This setup emphasizes uniformity in style and further enhances the visual presentation of the figurine as a discrete art piece.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image emphasize craftsmanship through natural wood textures, subtle lighting, and a muted color palette compared to the original bright appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B collectively highlight the craftsmanship through the natural wood textures, which are visible and dominant. The lighting is subtle, casting soft shadows that accentuate the finely carved wood, and the color palette remains muted, focusing on natural wood hues rather than vibrant colors that characterized the original image. This shift places emphasis on the artistry of the woodcraft in the figurine, celebrating its materials and craftsmanship over the previous cartoonish, colorful expression.",
