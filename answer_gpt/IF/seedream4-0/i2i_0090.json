      "question": "Does the edited image show the stapler from both the front and rear views side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two identical staplers positioned next to each other. The left one is facing forward, showing the front view, while the right one is facing backward, showing the rear view. This side-by-side positioning confirms that both views are shown.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two staplers are positioned side by side, with their front and rear views horizontally aligned. They are presented on the same plane, supporting the horizontal alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all parts of the stapler visible in both the front and rear views without any truncation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the front and rear views of the stapler appear fully visible. The entire shape and structure of each stapler are exhibited without any parts cut off or located outside the frame, ensuring no truncation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the front and rear staplers share the same blue color and design details, such as the smooth surfaces and metallic elements. They appear to be identical models displayed from different angles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is consistent across both views of the stapler. The same smooth, green cylindrical surface is visible in both instances. No additional elements are introduced, maintaining a uniform background.",
