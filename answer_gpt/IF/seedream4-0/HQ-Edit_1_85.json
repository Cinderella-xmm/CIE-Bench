      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a series of separate postcard-sized panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the image depicts a single continuous scene with elements rendered in a paper-cut style. There are no visible separations or borders that suggest multiple panels or postcard-sized divisions. This observation indicates a coherent and unified presentation rather than separate panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the girl’s blouse feature intricate lace details rendered in a paper-cut style with sharp, layered edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse of the girl indeed features intricate lace details. These details are rendered in a style mimicking paper-cut art, with clear, sharp, and layered edges that are characteristic of this technique. The depiction uses visual depth and layering to create an intricate and three-dimensional lace effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the violin been enlarged in size relative to the girl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In assessing Image B, the violin appears proportionate to the girl’s body, similar to expected dimensions within real-life scenarios. There are no indications of it being disproportionately large compared to common violin sizes relative to a player's arm and torso.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the girl’s pose show an enhanced sense of musical expression through refined hand placement, posture, or facial focus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the edited image style is distinct and stylistically focused on a paper-cut aesthetic, there is no overt enhancement in the girl's posture or hand placement that indicates an exaggerated sense of musical expression beyond what is already depicted. The hands and posture are consistent with playing a violin but do not suggest additional refinement specifically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image have a visual appearance consistent with being printed on textured cream stock (e.g., warm off-white tone, soft matte finish)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an appearance that aligns with traditional paper art, with a warm off-white tone that resembles textured cream stock. The matte finish and soft colors contribute to this effect, commonly associated with such printed materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible representation of the backside of any postcards, as the image is not divided into postcard panels. Additionally, there are no visible motifs or designs suggesting music sheet patterns on separate postcard backs.",
