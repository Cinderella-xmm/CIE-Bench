    "Question": "Q1: Is the perfume bottle constructed entirely out of Lego bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top portion of the perfume bottle, including the cap and part of the neck, is modified using Lego bricks, which is evident from the distinct shape and color typical of Lego pieces. However, the main body of the bottle, which is clear and faceted, remains unchanged from Image A and is not made from Lego. This indicates only parts of the bottle are constructed using Lego bricks, not the entire bottle.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the fabric background recreated using Lego bricks?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be a combination of Lego bricks and the original fabric's visual texture. The Lego bricks are evident at the bottom, with their distinct characteristic shapes. However, the overall background retains a fabric-like appearance, which suggests that not all of it is replaced by Lego bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image maintain the original composition and positioning of the perfume bottle and fabric?",
    "explanation": "In both images, the perfume bottle is centrally placed, and the fabric (or its Lego representation) maintains a similar positioning relative to the bottle. The primary change in Image B is the introduction of Lego bricks rather than a change in the composition or positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the details of the perfume bottle, including the cap and spray mechanism, accurately represented using Lego bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cap and part of the spray mechanism have been customized using Lego bricks, as evidenced by the visible stacked blocks. However, these Lego components aim to replicate the original design with attention to detail, maintaining the look of the cap and nozzle, although through stylized Lego representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the stop-motion diorama style consistently applied to both the perfume bottle and the fabric background?",
    "explanation": "The style in Image B integrates Lego elements in specific parts rather than consistently applying a diorama style throughout. The fabric background maintains its original soft, flowing look, while the bottle employs Lego elements selectively. This suggests an integration rather than a uniform Lego diorama approach across both elements.",
    "answer": "No"
