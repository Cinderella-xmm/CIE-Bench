        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the packaging is styled like a typical Funko Pop box, which often features an isometric view to showcase the figure inside along with the product design on the side.

        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure inside the box in Image B appears to be a chibi version of a child, represented with exaggerated features typical of chibi styles. The figure is depicted sitting cross-legged, holding a tablet, and dressed in casual attire, much like the setting of the child outside the box, which is common in collectible figures to highlight specific characters or themes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure outside the box in Image B is not shown in a realistic rendering with lifelike textures and lighting. Instead, it shares the same chibi and stylized features as the figure inside the packaging, and both do not represent photorealistic qualities. The textures and lighting used are consistent with artistic styling rather than realistic representation.",
