      "question": "Do the dolls have bold calligraphic outlines around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are stylized with distinct, bold outlines reminiscent of calligraphic art, which is often characterized by dark, thick strokes. This artistic choice highlights and defines the edges of the subjects clearly, consistent with calligraphic styles. In contrast, Image A does not exhibit such stylization and shows a more realistic photographic representation without thick outlines.",

      "question": "Are the dolls' clothing and hair depicted using flat planes of color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls' clothing and hair are illustrated using flat, uniform colors without gradients or textural details, characteristic of certain artistic and graphic design styles that rely on flat color fields for simplicity and visual impact. This approach differs from Image A, where variations in lighting create depth and texture in the depiction of clothing and hair.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the store environment been replaced with a subtly patterned, simplified background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed environment of the original store visible in Image A has been replaced with a more abstract, simplified background featuring calligraphic elements and muted tones. This change removes the visual complexity of the store setting and focuses attention on the main subjects by providing a less detailed backdrop.",

      "question": "Is the doll in the foreground still striking a ballet pose with a light-colored tutu?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main doll in Image B continues to strike a ballet pose, similar to Image A, with arms positioned outward and legs in a standing ballet posture. Both images show the doll wearing a light-colored tutu, maintaining the thematic costume, indicating no change in this aspect of the figure's presentation between both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seated doll in Image B retains its position sitting on a fuchsia mat while wearing a pink top, just as seen in Image A. This consistency indicates that the doll's position and attire have not been altered despite the changes elsewhere in the image through artistic reinterpretation.",
