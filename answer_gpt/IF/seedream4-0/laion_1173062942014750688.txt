    "Question": "Q1: Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a single, continuous serpent-like form is visible. The structure is not a collection of individual beads but instead appears as a cohesive shape, constructed to mimic a serpent motif. This is inferred from the smooth, flowing nature of the figure compared to Image A, where beads are presented in clusters or strands.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a serpent figure with alternating red and yellow patterns that simulate a scaly texture. This is visible from the distinct scale-like segmentation along the snake’s body, a common representation for reptiles like snakes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the serpent have two blue circular features positioned as eyes at its head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, at the head of the serpent, two distinct blue circular features are positioned where eyes would typically be. These blue features stand out and are visually aligned to represent the serpent's eyes, drawing from common reptile representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the black motifs arranged as detailed, tribal-style patterns along the serpent’s body?",
    "explanation": "Black motifs can be seen arranged in patterned lines and shapes along the serpent's body in Image B. These motifs have a stylized, tribal appearance due to their geometric and repeated nature, which suggests intention in design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the serpent’s tail extend into a long, thin, flowing form with small, dangling bead-like tips?",
    "explanation": "At the end of the serpent in Image B, the tail transitions into a long, slender form with what appears to be bead-like extensions at its tip. This transformation from a solid form to a flowing tail enhances the serpent-like depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are only the original colors (red, yellow, blue, black) used in the serpent, with no additional or unrelated colors introduced?",
    "explanation": "The edited image contains the same original colors: red, yellow, blue, and black, as seen in the beads of Image A. No additional colors are introduced in the serpent, maintaining visual consistency in color usage.",
    "answer": "Yes"
