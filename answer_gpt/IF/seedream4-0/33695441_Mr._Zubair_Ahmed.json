    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the railing of the staircase has been transformed to resemble a serpent's body, with scales and a continuous organic texture along the spiral path. This visual cue, combined with the common knowledge of how serpents look, suggests that the staircase has been artistically modified to represent a serpent creature rather than a typical architectural structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the surface of the steps remains smooth and consistent with marble or stone, typical of standard staircases. The concept of segmented scales is only applied to the railing, not the steps themselves. Thus, the steps do not appear as segmented scales.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The railing in the edited image resembles the scales and texture of a serpent, with patterns consistent with reptilian skin. While there is a transformation, there are no elements that resemble a spine or bone-like segments; thus, the transformation does not correspond to a spine-like structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image's railing shows a scaly texture reminiscent of a serpent's body, but there are no indications of wooden patterns or skeletal framework integrated within these scales, as the focus is on replicating reptilian skin.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a textured surface on the railing that resembles scales or stone-like ridges, adding to the appearance of a serpent-like quality. This visual effect creates a rocky texture along the serpent body, as observed from the scaly transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the natural spiral of the staircase but enhances its appearance to mimic the coiling of a serpent. This enhancement creates an effect of graceful, continuous coils through the modification of the railing into a seamless serpentine form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent creature exhibit visual traits suggesting antiquity and natural grandeur (such as weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the railing's scaly texture and design give it an antique and organic appearance, with forms that mimic nature and earthy tones. These visual traits contribute to a sense of antiquity and natural grandeur, often associated with serpents and mythical creatures.",
