      "question": "Is the object now shaped like a modern energy drink can instead of a sneaker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object being held has a distinct cylindrical shape typical of a modern energy drink can, with a pop-top lid characteristic of such cans. In contrast, in Image A, the object is clearly a sneaker with a standard shape associated with footwear. This transformation from a sneaker to a can shape is clear due to the differences in structure and design elements recognizable by combining visual cues with common world knowledge of these objects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior of the object retains the navy blue mesh pattern from the original sneaker design. This pattern is evident on the side areas of the can's shape, demonstrating continuity from the sneaker's visual texture while altering the overall object shape.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo, which includes a circular emblem with red and blue sections, is visible on the side of the can, similar to its placement on the original sneaker in Image A.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laces from the original sneaker have been represented as a textured, raised element wrapping around the can, creating the effect of embossed detail. This is a creative adaptation of the original sneaker's design feature into a different shape, integrating familiar lace aesthetics onto the cylindrical form of a can.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three navy blue stripes from the original sneaker's sole can be seen as an integral design feature on the lower half of the can. These stripes create a cohesive design adaptation, maintaining the original's style while re-contextualizing it onto the new can shape.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
