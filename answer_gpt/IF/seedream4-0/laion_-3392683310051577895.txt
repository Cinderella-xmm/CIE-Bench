    "Question": "Q1: Are the armrests of the sofa transformed into curled horn-like structures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests of the sofa have been visually altered to resemble curled horn-like structures. This conclusion is drawn from the clear visual cues of spiraling, textured shapes on both sides of the sofa, which are reminiscent of horns. Combining this observation with common knowledge about horn shapes, it is evident that these are indeed intended to look like animal horns.",

    "Question": "Q2: Have the tufted patterns on the sofa been replaced with bark-textured scales?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture of the sofa is significantly different from typical tufted patterns. Instead, the texture resembles bark, characterized by a rough and uneven surface. This texture mimics natural bark, rather than any fabric tufting, suggesting that the tufted patterns have been replaced with a more natural, bark-like appearance.",
