      "question": "Are the snowy mountain peaks visibly reshaped into jagged, wing-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks are visibly altered to appear jagged and spiky, resembling wing-like structures. This can be deduced from the sharp, upward-pointing formations that deviate from the smoother lines typically associated with natural mountain ranges. Such features are not present in Image A, where the mountain peaks maintain a traditional snowy and smooth appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the foreground lake display a pattern of reflective, scale-like textures across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground lake maintains a flat and reflective surface typical of a body of water, without any indication of scale-like textures appearing on its surface. The reflection is natural and doesn't simulate a pattern that would resemble scales.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the winding peninsula reshaped into a long, curving, sinewy tail structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The winding peninsula in Image B retains its natural landmass shape and alignment. It doesn’t transform into a structure that resembles a tail, which would require more dynamic curvature and sculpting to deviate from a land formation to a sinewy appendage.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant houses reconfigured into a continuous, segmented metallic spine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the houses in the distance maintain their structure and positioning, with no transformation into a spine-like formation. Such a change would require altering the continuity and alignment of the buildings into a segmented structure, which is not visually evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there distinct, swirling cloud formations in the sky that resemble eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cloud formations in Image B are typical of natural clouds, and while they are substantial and fluffy, they do not specifically resemble eyes. To depict eye-like formations, there would have to be a more defined pattern and shape within the clouds that suggest such imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the grassland area show directional, windswept textures resembling fur covering the creature’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassland area maintains its natural texture without any noticeable shift towards a fur-like texture. This analysis can be supported by the distinct separation in the textures of the creature’s body and the earth, where the earthy tones and weeds remain typical of a grassland expanse.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all modified elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, eyes, fur) integrate seamlessly into a single, coherent mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are some altered elements such as the jagged mountain peaks resembling wings; however, not all elements listed, such as scales on water, tail, spine, and eye-like clouds, are modified. Therefore, the integration into a coherent mythical beast as described is not complete based on these changes alone.",
