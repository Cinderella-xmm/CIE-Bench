    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the teapot is visibly made of glass, discernible by its transparency and the way light interacts with it. The typical characteristics of glass include a smooth surface and a clear appearance, which are evident here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the teapot transparent, allowing visibility through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the body of the teapot is transparent, as you can see the frosted patterns on one side and their reflection through the glass. Transparency is a definitive characteristic of glass used in objects like teapots.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has frosted floral patterns that closely resemble the engraved rose and leaves from Image A. The design elements are similar in style, featuring the same floral motifs, which shows that the edit retained the original floral designs in a frosted form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the handle and spout made of tinted amber glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle and the spout of the teapot appear to be made from tinted amber glass, evident by their warm, amber color. Glass handles often demonstrate a tint like this, made more visible by the light reflection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored surface showing a clear reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot on a surface that reflects its image. The clarity of the reflection suggests that the surface is indeed a mirrored surface, which is common for showcasing items to highlight their designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the teapot retain the same level of detail and design as the original engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B retains the floral patterns, the detail is different due to the frosted glass technique. Frosting typically creates softer, less sharply defined designs compared to engravings, resulting in a reduced level of detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original shape and proportions of the original metallic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image B with Image A, the teapot retains its overall shape and proportions regarding the body, spout, lid, and handle. Despite changes in material, the fundamental design and geometry remain consistent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
