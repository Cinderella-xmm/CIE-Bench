      "question": "Are bold, graphic lines used to delineate the outline and major features of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cat uses bold and graphic lines to clearly outline and define its shape and features, which is a characteristic often seen in illustrative or cartoon styles. These lines serve to separate different parts of the image distinctly and are visually prominent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses depicted in a flat, vibrant orange color without gradients or shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses appear with a flat, vibrant orange color. There is no evidence of gradients or shading present, which is indicative of a more stylized, graphic approach often seen in pop art or minimalistic illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beach background composed of simplified, abstract color blocks rather than realistic scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of simplified and abstract color blocks, with large, distinct areas of solid color rather than detailing, shading, or texture that would be present in a realistic depiction. This abstract representation is aligned with styles that prioritize bold color fields over realistic portrayals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the harness and the shadow under the cat replaced with gradient fills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness and the shadow under the cat lack the natural texture and detail of Image A. Instead, they feature smooth transitions in color, indicative of gradient fills rather than realistic textures or patterns. This approach fits with the overall graphic style of the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are red, blue, and yellow prominently used as flat, high-contrast colors throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition largely uses primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—in a flat, highly saturated manner. These colors are applied in large blocks and contribute to the high-contrast, vivid quality of the image, which is a common trait in certain artistic movements like pop art or graphic design.",
