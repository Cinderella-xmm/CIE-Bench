    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly enclosed within a glass dome. The dome is indicated by its curved shape encapsulating the ship and the visible seams at the bottom where it meets the base, suggesting a traditional glass dome diorama.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails have distinct shadows, layered edges, and creases that imitate paper's qualities. This is identified by the two-dimensional appearance and the way light interacts with the material, suggesting a papercraft design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a layer beneath the ship appearing as blue resin, with a shimmering quality and wave-like texture. The resin-like transparency and reflections enhance the illusion of water, aligning with diorama techniques.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the seagulls are present, but there are no visible wires. They appear to be floating in air rather than being suspended, without any indicators of wire support.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ship in Image B maintains its original details, such as the hull's shape, masts, and rigging, but is presented in a smaller scale to fit within the diorama. This is evident from the comparability in design structure but reduced overall size.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue layer under the ship in Image B has a translucent quality and a texture that reflects light in a way that resembles flowing water. This is typical of resin used in dioramas to mimic water's reflective and dynamic nature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the curved glass dome visibly present with clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curved glass dome is distinct with clearly defined boundaries, visible at the bottom and sides where the light refraction creates a slight distortion effect, typical of light interacting with curved glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
