      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror and faucet positioning appears identical to Image A. Both images feature a centrally placed, rectangular mirror with rounded edges situated above the countertop, and directly below a centrally positioned faucet above the sink. The layout has not shifted or been resized, indicating the original arrangement is unchanged.",

      "question": "Have the wall materials been changed to reflect classical Roman architectural aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases walls covered in marble with decorative moldings and intricate designs, aligning with classical Roman architecture elements, including ornate embellishments. Image A features a simple, dark-colored wall with a modern appearance, lacking any ornamental features matching Roman aesthetics. This signifies a clear change to reflect classical Roman architectural aesthetics in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting now includes ornate wall sconces resembling torches, which are consistent with Roman architectural aesthetics that often featured elaborate lighting fixtures. In contrast, Image A features simple, modern pendant lights. The transition to torch-like sconces in Image B demonstrates a change made to evoke Roman aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a plant placed in a decorative urn-like vase, which is similar to the style seen in classical Roman decor, where urns and pottery were commonly used for plants. In Image A, the plant is in a plain, dark vase with a minimalist design. This change in plant holder style to a more ornate, classic look reflects an adjustment to match Roman aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B introduces features like marble walls and decorative sconces that suggest a Roman-inspired style, it lacks explicitly typical Roman-style bathhouse elements such as columns, arches, or frescoes, which are hallmark features. Thus, these specific classical Roman architectural elements are not present in the scene.",
