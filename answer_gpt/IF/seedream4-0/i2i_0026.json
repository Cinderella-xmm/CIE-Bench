      "question": "Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a sequence of actions depicted in four separate frames. Each frame illustrates different stages of a tennis swing sequence: starting from a preparatory stance, moving through the swing action, the ball contact (hit), and what appears to be a follow-through motion. This progression aligns with typical depictions of a sports instructional sequence, where actions are broken down step-by-step.",

      "question": "Is the illustration drawn in clean line art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features illustrations with distinct outlines and minimal shading, indicative of a clean line art style. The characters and objects are delineated with solid lines, without intricate details or textures, focusing more on form and action representation. This is characteristic of clean line art style, which emphasizes simplicity and clarity.",

      "question": "Does the illustration use monochrome color fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various colors are utilized to fill different elements in the illustration, such as the red shirt, black shorts, and the gray background. Monochrome typically means the use of only one color in varying shades or an overall hue. Here, multiple distinct colors are present, contradicting the idea of a monochrome color fill.",

      "question": "Has the background been completely removed from the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is notably simplistic, consisting of a uniform gray color that serves as a contrast to the outlined figures. While the background is minimalistic, it has not been completely removed. Such a background provides context to the action without any complex elements or details.",

      "question": "Is the 4-frame illustration arranged in a horizontal format as an instructional strip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the frames stacked vertically, not horizontally. The sequence of four frames is presented one above the other, which is typical of instructional sequences designed to guide the viewer step-by-step through a process or action. Hence, the arrangement is vertical.",
