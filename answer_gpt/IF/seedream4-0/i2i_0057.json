      "question": "Is the central figure in the edited image now a robot horse rather than a biological horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal has a clearly robotic appearance with mechanical components, indicating it is not a biological horse. This is evident from the metallic exterior and the design elements that are typical of fictional biomechanical creatures, which differ from natural animal forms. Additionally, the alterations made to resemble robotic features point towards it being a robot rather than a biological entity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image maintain the same posture as the original horse, with its head lowered as if grazing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the robotic cow stands upright with its head held high, which contrasts with a grazing posture. In Image A, the original cow is walking without its head lowered to graze, reflecting a straightforward posture in both images. Thus, the stance of the biomechanical creature does not mimic a grazing posture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have a silver-white metallic shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a biomechanical cow with a silver-white metallic shell, which can be identified from the shiny and reflective surface typical of metal. These elements suggest the artificial nature of the creature, aligning with common representations of robotic materials.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exposed joint mechanisms visible on the biomechanical horse in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the edited image, the robotic cow displays various exposed joint mechanisms. These joints resemble typical mechanical structures found in robots, with visible components like pistons or hinges that are characteristic of robotics, differing greatly from natural joints found in biological animals.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have glowing red sensor eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the biomechanical cow in Image B are visibly glowing red, which suggests sensor functionality or a stylized element for effect. Such red glowing eyes are a common trope in science fiction for robots and convey a sense that these are technological devices rather than natural ocular structures.",
