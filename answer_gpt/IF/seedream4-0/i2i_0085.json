    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the painting visibly extend beyond its frame to create a 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame of the painting has some orange-red foliage extending beyond it, suggesting a 3D effect. This creates an illusion as if parts of the painting, particularly the foliage, are coming out of the frame, enhancing the dimensionality.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elements from the painting visually merge into the room environment, such as appearing on the wall or floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange-red foliage from the painting extends onto the wall beyond the frame's border. While it does not appear on the floor, the extension onto the wall suggests a blending of the painting into the room's environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transitions between the painting and the room environment smooth without any abrupt edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition of the painting's elements, specifically the foliage, onto the wall in Image B appears smooth and deliberate. The foliage seems to naturally extend onto the wall without harsh lines or abrupt changes, creating a cohesive flow from painting to the room.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original elements of the painting, such as trees, water, and the sun, still identifiable in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the added 3D elements in Image B, the original elements like the trees, water, and sun remain intact and clearly identifiable. The focus of the scene and its key components are preserved even with the decorative additions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows in the extended portions of the painting match those in the actual room environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D parts of the painting, primarily the foliage, in Image B reflect consistent lighting with the existing room environment. The shadows seem coherent with the light source, maintaining the room's visual harmony and preventing any dissonance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
