      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are office desks with computers, chairs, and individuals sitting and interacting at a table. These visual elements typically depict a front view of an office setup because we can see the face of the desk and the chairs in perspective as if viewed from the front. Such cues indicate a frontal depiction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows individuals seated at desks, interacting with computer screens that are visible from a straightforward angle.
