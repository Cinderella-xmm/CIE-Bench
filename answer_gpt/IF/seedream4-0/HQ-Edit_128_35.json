      "question": "Is the typewriter now depicted as part of a notebook cover, with the overall shape resembling a closed book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presentation shows a typewriter on a surface that appears to be part of a cover, with the surrounding structure resembling the shape typical of a closed book. This, combined with the visual cue of a textured spine on one side, suggests that the object is indeed being presented as part of a notebook cover. The overall dimensions and aspect ratio also suggest this is not a flat image like in Image A, but rather a three-dimensional object resembling a book.",
