      "question": "Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown as a 3D rendering, prominently displaying the upper body, arms, and shield. The use of lighting, shadow, and detail in the suit and shield emphasizes a three-dimensional form. This depiction aligns with the characteristics of a 3D half-body figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character seemingly coming out from a television, as indicated by the character's position partly outside the TV frame, creating the illusion of breaking the fourth wall. The angle and setup suggest an intended action of emerging from the screen.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted holding a shield in front of the body, similar to defensive posturing often seen in comic books or movies. The arm positioning and grip lend the appearance of readiness for defense.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image simulate an augmented reality display effect through lighting, shadows, and spatial realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B achieves an augmented reality effect with realistic lighting and shadows that contribute to the illusion of depth and space. The character's partial emergence from the screen, combined with digital interface elements visible on the TV, enhances the simulated AR experience.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the character's original appearance and posture been maintained while implementing the new effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character retains core elements of the original appearance, such as the suit design and shield, while adopting the new 3D and augmented reality effects, and the posture does not deviate significantly from expectations in terms of expressive function and depiction style.",
