      "question": "Does the edited image show a left-side 90-degree view of the sofa alongside the front view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the sofa is important to assess. The sofa is arranged in an 'L' shape, providing both a front view and a partial side view. However, it is not a precise 90-degree left-side view. Instead, it is slightly angled. The positioning within the room suggests a typical arrangement where one can see both the front and partial side sections of an L-shaped sofa, common in interior design to maximize space and comfort. Thus, the view is more of a combined perspective rather than a strict 90-degree side view.",

      "question": "Are the dimensions of the sofa consistent between the front and left-side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By evaluating Image B solely, the dimensions of the sofa appear consistent between the front and side sections. The cushions, armrests, and seat heights appear uniform and proportional, maintaining visual coherence that suggests the two sections belong to the same sofa piece. This consistency is important for maintaining aesthetic balance in interior design, especially in sectional sofas.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the front and side views of the sofa smooth and coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the transition between the front view and the side view of the sofa appears smooth and coherent. The color, cushion style, and alignment between sections of the sofa are maintained, facilitating a natural visual flow between the connected components of the sofa. This alignment is crucial for the visual appeal and functionality of sectional sofas in home decor.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the sofa consistent in both the front and side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows on the sofa are consistent between the front and side views. The light source, likely natural light from a window, casts shadows that align correctly with the sofa's folds and edges, corresponding accurately to the indicated lighting direction. Such consistency ensures that the scene maintains natural and realistic visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do objects around the sofa (e.g., wall art) appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the combined view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the objects around the sofa, such as the wall art, appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the sofa's combined view. The painting above the sofa is centered and appropriately sized to the wall space and sofa width, following principles of scale and proportion in interior decor. This arrangement ensures balance and enhances the room's aesthetic.",
