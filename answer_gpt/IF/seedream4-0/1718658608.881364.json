      "question": "Is the octopus replaced by a series of curved ceramic sculptures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of an octopus, but it resembles a crafted object rather than a natural creature. The curves and shapes indicate a sculptured form, likely made of ceramic, based on its shape and texture. Hence, the original octopus has been creatively replaced by a ceramic representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces in Image B appear shiny and reflective, indicative of a glazed finish typically found in ceramic objects. This glossy texture mimics that of a glazed ceramic piece, distinguished by its smooth and reflective qualities.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme of the sculptures in Image B includes deep blues, reminiscent of oceanic tones. This choice of color further supports the interpretation of them as ocean-inspired ceramics.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of the sculptures in Image B have a noticeable texture, with patterns resembling scales. This textured surface is similar to the appearance of an octopus's skin, though stylized in the form of a ceramic object.",
