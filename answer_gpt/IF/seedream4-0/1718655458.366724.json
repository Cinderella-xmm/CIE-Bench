    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are clearly LEGO bricks, characterized by their uniform brick shape. They retain the marbled patterns visible in Image A's spheres and cubes, suggesting consistency in pattern despite the shape change. This reflects a replacement of original shapes with LEGO but maintaining the original marbled aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the LEGO bricks have a smooth finish but there are subtle highlights indicating a semi-gloss or shiny surface typical of LEGO bricks, rather than a flat matte texture. Therefore, despite the clean appearance, there's a hint of reflection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts LEGO bricks organized neatly in a structured and stacked formation on a flat wooden shelf. This structured presentation is different from the scattered or disorderly situation and aligns with an orderly arrangement on a shelf.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks display subtle interlocking details such as studs or recessed connectors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, LEGO bricks are depicted with recognizably standard features such as studs for interlocking on the top and recessed areas that allow connection to other bricks. This representation is consistent with typical LEGO designs meant for interlocking functionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background simplified into a clean, uniform, and uncluttered minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B appears to be a plain, light color with no additional objects or textures visible, creating a clean and minimalist aesthetic. This simplicity contrasts with the textured and detailed background observed in Image A. Thus, the background is effectively simplified in the edited image.",
