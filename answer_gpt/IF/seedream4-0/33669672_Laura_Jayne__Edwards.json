      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears with a shiny and reflective texture typical of bronze sculptures, which suggests a metallic surface finish. The figure's outline and the light reflection further reinforce the impression of a sculpture.",

      "question": "Are the limbs visibly elongated compared to natural human proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The limbs of the figure in Image B appear slender and elongated, lacking the natural proportions of a typical human form. When considering art and sculpture, such exaggeration of human features is common to create an aesthetically unique appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's legs are portrayed with smooth, flowing lines that convey a sense of motion and grace. This dynamic stance is often used in sculpture to suggest movement and fluidity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all floral elements been replaced with geometric patterns consistent with Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the figure has floral decorations. In Image B, these floral elements are replaced with geometric, angular patterns on the boots, which align with the Art Deco style known for such designs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rendered in metallic tones while preserving the original color scheme (teal, red, pink)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background retains a teal color but with a metallic sheen indicative of bronze. The red and pink accents from the flowers seem to be morphed into metallic geometric patterns, changing their appearance rather than preserving the original color scheme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a uniform turquoise that complements the metallic look of the sculpture. This consistent color scheme enhances the overall aesthetic by providing a clean, cohesive backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the adornments on the figure composed of symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typical of Art Deco style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The adornments on the figure in Image B consist of structured, repetitive geometric patterns, especially seen on the boots, aligning with the Art Deco style's penchant for symmetrical and angular designs.",
