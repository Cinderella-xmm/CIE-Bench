      "question": "Do the skyscrapers appear as integrated, articulated robotic limbs forming a larger guardian-like figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue of blue neon lines and structures resembling articulated robotic arms are visible, giving the impression of a robotic structure extending from the skyscrapers. Each limb appears connected to central structures, suggesting a deliberate design reminiscent of a guardian figure. Image A features regular skyscrapers with traditional architectural lighting, lacking such constructs. Comparing both, the transformative design in Image B is a deliberate artistic choice to convey a technological or futuristic guardian-like appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible neon circuitry patterns running along the facades of the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one can observe vivid neon blue patterns that resemble circuitry, seamless technological layouts integrated onto the building surfaces. These patterns are typically associated with futuristic and digital influences. Image A does not have these patterns, showcasing regular building lighting. The neon patterns in Image B suggest a visual transformation to convey a high-tech digital theme.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the building facades feature reflective, scale-like panels arranged in an overlapping or segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict reflective, scale-like panels on the buildings; instead, the emphasis is on neon lights and robotic extensions. Image A also lacks such paneling characteristics, featuring smooth and modern glass surfaces common in urban architecture. Evaluation of Image B shows no evidence of reflecting scales or segmented designs, focusing more on the digital transformation of facades.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the expressways depicted as glowing, curving, spine-like structures emitting light and winding through the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows expressways designed with a glowing effect, resembling an illuminated spine with curving pathways highlighted in bright yellowish-orange light. This artistic depiction creates a dynamic, flowing structure that moves through the city. In Image A, the expressways are more realistically lit with standard lighting found in urban environments, highlighting the intentional stylization in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of the buildings feature enhanced, fin-like vertical structures that resemble mechanical protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of buildings highlight enhanced vertical elements accented with neon lights, which may resemble mechanical or fin-like structures due to their enhanced, stylized appearance. Image A reveals usual architectural pinnacles without such enhancements, indicating that the fin-like mechanical portrayal is specific to Image B's transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there rotating holographic elements positioned across the skyline that resemble pulsing, eye-like forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible holographic projections above the city, designed in a manner that resembles rotating, eye-like forms that pulse, integrating well with the futuristic theme. These elements don't exist in Image A, affirming their deliberate addition to enhance Image B's cybernetic cityscape.",
