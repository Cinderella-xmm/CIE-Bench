      "question": "Is only one zebra visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a person skiing, starting their journey at a marked starting line. Since the image involves skiing on snow, we understand that zebras are not depicted in this scenario, as they would not be typically found in such snowy conditions. Thus, there are no zebras visible in the edited image.",

      "question": "Has all the grass been removed from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a snowy landscape with trees in the background, common in winter settings. Grass would normally be absent or covered in snow within such environments; thus no grass was visible to begin with in both images.",

      "question": "Is the grass area replaced by a green gradient plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy ground and blue sky are depicted, which are consistent with a wintry scene. There is no grass nor a green gradient plane visible in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a single person skiing under a clear sky with a forested backdrop. This composition suggests a calm and focused atmosphere, typical of a peaceful day outdoors in a winter setting, without additional distracting elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to show a person skiing. There were no zebras in Image A within this snowy setting either, leading to the understanding that there were no zebra details to preserve in the edited image.",
