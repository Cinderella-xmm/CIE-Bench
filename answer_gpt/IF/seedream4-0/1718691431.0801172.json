      "question": "Are the kimono and fox mask rendered with sharp geometric shapes and angular lines characteristic of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono and fox mask feature sharp geometric shapes and angular lines. The mask has strong linear elements, and the kimono's patterns consist of straight lines and geometric motifs. Art Deco design often includes such geometric and angular elements, reflecting a streamlined and stylized appearance.",

      "question": "Do the outlines and internal details of both the kimono and the fox mask feature prominent bold lines and angular geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono and the fox mask exhibit prominent bold lines and angular geometry. The lines are sharp and well-defined, which gives a structured and angular appearance common in stylized designs. These elements are clearly visible with the lines in the design patterns and the mask details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the floral patterns on the kimono been replaced with simplified, abstract, and stylized motifs rather than realistic flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns from Image A have been replaced with more abstract and simplified motifs. The designs on the kimono in Image B are less realistic and more geometric, echoing a stylized approach typical of abstract art. These motifs are less detailed and more focused on shape and form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a color palette consisting of deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones. The kimono displays rich red hues and subtle pinks, along with metallic-like silvery patterns that contribute to the stylized aesthetic. These are the primary colors visible in the image.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced, with harmonious alignment between the kimono and mask, and do the textures appear refined and unified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition is symmetrically balanced as the kimono and mask are centrally aligned. This symmetry contributes to a harmonious look. The textures appear refined, with smooth transitions and unified style between the mask and kimono, demonstrating careful design coherence.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylistic changes, the silhouette and proportions of the person’s body, kimono, and mask appear preserved. The same general shapes and sizes are maintained, indicating harmony in proportion, aligning with typical garment design principles.",
