        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted with bold outlines, simplified features, and bright colors, which are typical characteristics of cartoon style. The lines are clear and definitive, and the details are not as intricate as they would be in a realistic depiction. This suggests that the rendering style is indeed cartoon-like.",
