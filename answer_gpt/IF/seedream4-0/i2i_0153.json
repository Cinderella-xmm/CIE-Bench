    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the image been converted into a realistic cartoon rendering style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck and the surroundings are drawn in a clear, outlined manner typical of a cartoon style, with flat colors and simplified texture, which is characteristic of a cartoon rendering. This differs significantly from a photographic style and suggests deliberate artistic simplification and stylization into a cartoon form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the truck retain its original structure in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the truck maintains its essential features and proportions, such as the cab shape, chrome elements, and wheel arrangement. These structural characteristics recognize it as the same model depicted in Image A. Despite the stylistic transformation into a cartoon appearance, its original structure remains intact.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lines in the truck bolder compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the truck with distinct, thick outlines around major components like the cab, wheels, and exhaust pipes. These bolder lines are typically absent in realistic images like Image A, which relies on subtle shading and gradients instead. Thus, the lines are indeed bolder in the cartoon rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the colors in the image been made more vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the truck and the background appear to be more vibrant and uniform compared to the realistic and naturally varied hues in Image A. This saturation is a common artistic choice in cartoons to enhance visual appeal and contrast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background in the image simplified compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and sky are rendered with less detail, using flat colors and minimal shading, as opposed to the intricate detail and gradient shading in Image A. This simplification aligns with common cartoon style attributes, where backgrounds are often abstracted to focus attention on the main subject.",
