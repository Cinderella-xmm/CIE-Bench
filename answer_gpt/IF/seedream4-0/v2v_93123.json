      "question": "Has the diffuse, smoky brown background been replaced with an expansive blackboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the person and the pineapple shows a blackboard, which is different from Image A where the background appears to be a smoky brown color. The visual difference in the background is clear, indicating that the diffuse, smoky brown backdrop in Image A has been replaced by a blackboard in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blackboard intricately covered with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blackboard behind the figure and pineapple indeed features multiple chalk writings, including complex mathematical equations and a prominent swirling galactic sketch. The presence of these elements suggests that the board is adorned with intricate details relevant to relativity or cosmic themes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple remain consistent after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the lighting on the visible parts of the person and the pineapple appears warm and consistent. The change in the background from a smoky brown to a blackboard does not seem to affect the lighting quality on the person and the pineapple, maintaining the same soft, warm illumination.",

      "question": "Does the blackboard exhibit an aged appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blackboard shows signs of wear and aging, as seen by the texture and appearance of old chalk markings and the overall vintage look of the board. These details lend an aged appearance to the blackboard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining both images, the positions of the person (modeled after Albert Einstein) and the pineapple are the same in Image A and Image B. The orientation and detailing of both elements have not changed, aside from the alteration in the background.",
