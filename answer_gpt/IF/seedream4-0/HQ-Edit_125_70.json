        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible logo on the handle of the hammer. The logo is placed at the head end of the wooden handle, and it appears to be a small, geometric design. Such logos are often used for branding purposes, especially on high-quality tools, as a way to signify the manufacturer or designer. This was not visible in the original image, implying an addition in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are there elegant, readable typographic elements displayed directly on the wood shavings scattered across the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are elegant typographic elements on the workbench near the wood shavings, spelling out 'Debitoire' in a script-like font. Such typographic elements can add a sense of artistry or branding to a scene, often used in advertising or artistic compositions to blend text naturally into the environment. This type of intervention was not present in Image A, indicating a clear addition.",

      "question": "Is there a horizontal rustic textured banner positioned at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a distinctive horizontal banner across the top that resembles rustic or vintage parchment texture. This element serves as a decorative framing or as a space for potential text or branding, which was not present in Image A, indicating it is an intentional edit for stylistic purpose.",

      "question": "Is the pegboard in grayscale with visible copper-colored accents on tools or hardware?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pegboard has a neutral, perhaps grayscale appearance, with various tools hanging on it. However, upon examining closely, there are visible copper-colored accents on the tools, particularly the heads or handles that have a metallic sheen. It is common in tool design to use copper or copper-like finishes to add aesthetic value and sometimes indicate durability.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a sleek, minimalist business card visible behind the tools on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a business card is tucked behind the pegboard tools discretely. It follows a minimalist design, typically featuring simple text and layout. In professional and artisanal environments, such cards serve dual purposes of contact sharing and branding. This card was not visible in Image A and is an addition made in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are all original tools visible and retained in their original positions on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image A and Image B, the tools appear to be unchanged and remain in their original configurations and positions on the pegboard. This consistency ensures that the editorial changes focus on other elements like text and logo additions, without altering the basic substantive elements of the pegboard setup.",
