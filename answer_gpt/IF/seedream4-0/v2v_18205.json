      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents both the horse and the elephant with a high degree of detail in their musculature. The horse's muscles are clearly defined, with evident lines and contouring that suggest a strong, well-formed creature. Similarly, the elephant also showcases detailed textures that suggest its skin and muscle structure. This intricate detailing points to a focus on anatomical accuracy and artistic skill.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition is carefully balanced with the horse standing squarely on the platform, and the large mass of the elephant providing a stable base. The artistic arrangement suggests careful consideration of symmetry and proportional balance, ensuring that the horse and elephant appear harmoniously aligned within the frame. This creates a visually pleasing and stable composition.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits characteristics associated with Renaissance art, such as the use of chiaroscuro (light-dark contrast), attention to realistic anatomical detail, and a harmonious composition. The dramatic lighting and detailed depiction of living subjects align with Renaissance themes that focus on realism and the beauty of the natural world, combined with technical skill in form and light.",
