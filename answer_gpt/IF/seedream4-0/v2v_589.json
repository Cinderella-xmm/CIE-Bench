      "question": "Are there exactly five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are arranged linearly on the table. By counting the dolls, it's evident that there are six of them, not five. This is a clear observation from the image, and no cross-reference to Image A is needed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a vibrant lime-green color and texture similar to the shoe and tennis ball in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls indeed have a vibrant lime-green color, similar to the shoe and tennis ball depicted in Image A. The color is bright and matches the tone of the items in the original image. However, the texture of the nesting dolls appears smooth, which is different from the texture observed on the tennis ball and shoe. The tennis ball has a fuzzy exterior, and the shoe has a leather-like texture. Therefore, while the color is similar, the texture is not.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from largest to smallest in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the nesting dolls lined up from left to right in decreasing size order, starting with the largest on the left and ending with the smallest on the right, which is a common way to display nesting dolls for visual effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the nesting dolls are placed on a table with visible wood grain and decorative carvings, which suggest it is a wooden table of a sophisticated, possibly antique, style. This combines visual observations with common knowledge of wooden furniture characteristics.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image subtle and non-distracting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is a simple, neutral color without any patterns or distracting elements. This subtlety ensures focus remains on the nesting dolls and the table, aligning with the definition of a non-distracting background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image orientation appears to be horizontal, and a visual estimation suggests a 3:2 aspect ratio. This can be deduced by comparing the width and height; the proportionality seen aligns with the characteristics of a 3:2 ratio, which is common for landscape images.",
