      "question": "Is the image formatted as a magazine cover with a clear layout resembling a vintage sports publication?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it features a layout typical of magazine covers with a prominent title at the top, a subheading, and a main header at the bottom. The combination of elements such as bold text and a distinct cover image set against a themed graphic style evoke the aesthetic of vintage sports magazines, which often employ these elements to attract attention.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is a visible textured grain overlay applied uniformly across the image to simulate a vintage print effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an observable textured grain effect over the image, especially noticeable in the faded edges and throughout the image surface. This is typical in recreating a vintage print look, as older printed materials often feature similar visual textures due to the printing processes of the time.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the reds (e.g., jersey stripes, socks) and greens (e.g., field) significantly more vibrant and saturated than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image B shows enhanced vibrancy in colors, particularly noticeable in the red stripes of the jersey and the green field. This increased saturation is likely intended to draw viewer attention and is a common technique used in print design for emphasis and a sense of liveliness.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the text '1962 Champions' prominently at the top in large, bold lettering. Below it, 'Inside: The Game Changers' appears in a slightly smaller yet still readable font. Placement, size, and legibility contribute to their function as effective headlines typical of a magazine cover.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the houses and trees retain their detail, with recognizable architectural features and foliage. They are not reduced to silhouettes, maintaining the original level of detail seen in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom of Image B prominently features the text 'FOOTY LEGENDS' in a large, bold serif font, spanning the width of the image in uppercase letters. This design choice emphasizes the importance of the title, typical for main focus text on covers.",
