      "question": "Has the portrait been reimagined in a dynamic Xieyi style Chinese ink wash painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrait utilizes elements typical of the Xieyi style, such as expressive, free-flowing brushstrokes to convey the form of the subject, particularly with the use of black ink strokes for outlining and shading, and the soft use of blue and grey washes. These characteristics are consistent with the Xieyi style of Chinese ink wash painting, which is known for its dynamic and spontaneous portrayal of subjects.",

      "question": "Are the texture of the dark hair and the form of the blue coat conveyed using bold, spontaneous black ink strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark hair and blue coat are primarily rendered with broad and swift black ink strokes that suggest movement and texture, characteristic of a spontaneous and bold technique often employed in expressive ink wash paintings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features and cravat articulated using softer, graded grey washes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailing around the facial features and cravat areas appear softer and more nuanced, achieved with a subtle gradation of grey washes, which provides a delicate contrast to the bold black lines used elsewhere in the portrait. This softer approach helps define these features without harsh outlines.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the portrait on a surface that appears to have a slightly textured and antique patina, typical of traditional Asian papers that are often used in ink wash paintings to enhance the depth and character of the washes and strokes applied on them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, there is a detailed wooden frame surrounding the portrait, but in Image B, this has been reduced to minimalistic, suggestive ink outlines instead of a full pattern, reflecting a shift towards simplicity in line with ink wash painting styles.",
