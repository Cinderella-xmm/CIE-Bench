      "question": "Is the entire cat composed of crystal materials with no visible fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual characteristics of the cat show that its body is made up of multiple faceted, light-reflective surfaces, indicating the use of a crystal-like material. There are no natural textures or indications of individual fur strands, as one would expect in a typical furry appearance. The entire structure of the cat has a uniform crystalline appearance, suggesting it is indeed composed solely of crystal materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body parts of the cat constructed primarily from clear and smoky quartz crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the cat in Image B is made from an array of gemstone-like facets, showing transparency and slightly opaque regions. This aligns with the characteristics of clear and smoky quartz, which commonly feature both clear and slightly colored or smoky areas. The cat's crystalline appearance is consistent with these types of quartz crystals.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are brown and black obsidian accents used to represent the calico pattern on the cat’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinctly darker areas creating a color pattern on the cat, which fits the role of the calico pattern visible in a real cat. These areas are probably crafted using an obsidian-like material, considering their deep color and shine, which is typical of polished obsidian.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cat’s eyes crafted from vibrant green emerald crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the cat in Image B appear as two bright, vibrant green elements set within the crystalline structure of the head. This color and the way light plays through them are characteristic of emeralds, suggesting that green emerald-like crystals have been used for the eyes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cat seated on a plain, polished wooden block with no added decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the cat is positioned on what appears to be a natural wooden block. The wood shows natural knots and grain patterns, and the surface does not exhibit any artificial polish or smooth finish typically associated with polished wood. Moreover, there are natural elements such as leaves around it, indicating that it is not decorated with any manmade elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the wooden block appear natural and polished, providing a clear contrast to the crystalline cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden block holds a natural appearance with visible texture and grain, and while it shows its natural wood characteristics, it does not seem artificially polished. However, this natural look indeed provides a contrast due to the smooth and reflective nature of the crystalline cat sitting on top of it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the cat maintained its original seated posture with paws forward and tail curved behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cat maintains a posture with its paws forward and its tail curved, similar to its portrayal in Image A. This consistency in posture suggests that the transformation into a crystalline form did not alter its position or overall pose.",
