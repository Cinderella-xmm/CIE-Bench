      "question": "Does the edited image depict the medieval structure as a colossal stone golem with a humanoid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is depicted as a large, humanoid figure resembling a stone golem. This is evident from its overall shape, which includes limbs and a torso, giving it a giant humanoid appearance. The head features resemble a crown, enhancing this perception. This differs from a medieval structure, which typically includes architectural elements like towers and archways, seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the archways visibly transformed into articulated limbs resembling arms or legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure’s architectural elements have been transformed into limbs that resemble arms and legs of a humanoid figure. This transformation gives the appearance of articulated limbs, turning the structure into a golem-like entity. In contrast, Image A features static archways as part of the architectural design.",

      "question": "Do the battlements at the top of the structure resemble a crown-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the structure is designed to resemble a crown on the humanoid figure’s head, which is a departure from the functional battlements used for defense in medieval constructions as seen in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the giant stone golem in Image B is covered with glowing glyphs, which replace the original wall texture found in Image A. These glyphs contribute to the mystical and ancient atmosphere of the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone golem is prominently silhouetted against the sky, with areas that emit a mystical aura, enhancing its fantastical nature. This aura is not present in Image A, which shows a solid medieval wall without such effects.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small human figure walking with a dog is replaced by a luminous, ethereal entity. This entity appears wisp-like and contributes to the otherworldly atmosphere of the image. In Image A, the human figure is distinct and grounded.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
