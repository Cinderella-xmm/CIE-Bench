      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the vase and bouquet been transformed into a 3D printed display model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects, including the vase and bouquet, have a uniform color and texture consistent with 3D printed materials. The design features solid colors and lacks the complexity of natural objects, suggesting the transformation into a 3D model. Visual characteristics such as the absence of individual flower textures support this interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D printed model appear to be made of matte material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the 3D printed model in Image B lacks shine or gloss, which are properties of matte materials. This finish is typically seen in displays to reduce reflection and focus on form over texture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a display plaque added at the base of the 3D printed model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A plaque can be seen on the base of the 3D printed model in Image B, indicating additional information or a label for the display. This is commonly used in exhibitions and showcases to provide context or details about the object.",

      "question": "Has the background been set as a tech expo booth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows elements typical of a tech expo, including branding banners, people engaged in discussions, and technology setups. These visual cues align with common characteristics of tech expo environments, such as booths with company names and technological displays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the 3D printed model maintain the design of the original vase and bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the 3D model in Image B replicates the general shape and arrangement of a vase and bouquet, the intricate design is simplified, evoking a stylized version rather than maintaining the fine detail of natural objects. Image A features real flowers and a more complex setting.",
