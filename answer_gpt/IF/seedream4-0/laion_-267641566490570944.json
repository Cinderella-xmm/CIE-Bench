      "question": "Are the jagged mountain peaks transformed into ancient dragon spirits with distinct dragon-like features such as heads, limbs, and tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a dragon with distinct dragon-like features, such as a head, scales, and a long sinuous body, is integrated into the mountainous landscape, replacing the original mountain peaks. By observing the dragon's clear head, distinct horns, and layered scales, it's evident that the transformation includes these specific features, making it appear as an ancient dragon spirit built into the natural terrain.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays surfaces within the dragon structure that resemble scales characteristic of dragon skin. The texture appears rock-like, merging aspects of the natural mountain surface with the fantastical elements of dragon scales, a distinct feature visible on the dragon's body, which mimics a natural mountain texture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body, specifically along the spine and other elevated areas, is adorned with vegetation that resembles moss. This greenery appears to grow along the scales of the dragon, suggesting a connection to the natural, mountainous form it emulates.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dragon's head with distinct features such as crystal-like horns and serpentine eyes, replacing what might have been one of the tallest mountain peaks. The horns and eyes are clearly visible and provide a fantastical element that is consistent with the question's description.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the dragon's body as a long, sinuous, snake-like extension below the dragon's head. These extensions blend into the mist and curve in a way similar to coiled limbs or tails, consistent with the question's description.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of the dragon-like structures into the misty, mountainous environment is smooth without abrupt or jarring visual transitions. The mist envelops both the dragon form and the surrounding landscape seamlessly, preserving a natural flow.",
