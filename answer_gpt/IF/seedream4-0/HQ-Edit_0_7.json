      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly shown to be enclosed within a transparent dome, as evidenced by the reflection and outline of the glass. This is a common way to display dioramas, allowing the viewer to see the contents inside while protecting them from dust or damage. The glass dome creates a contained environment for the elements inside, an indication used material or sometimes plastic in display items.",

      "question": "Is the parrot depicted in a chibi style with a large head and simplified body proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot is depicted in a chibi style characterized by a disproportionately large head and simple, rounded body features. Chibi style often emphasizes cuteness, which is achieved here by simplifying the anatomy and exaggerating certain features like the head. The parrot's head is notably larger compared to its body, consistent with chibi proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaves surrounding the parrot significantly larger than normal scale and vibrant in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves surrounding the parrot are notably large relative to the size of a typical parrot, which is a common feature in stylized or fantastical representations. The vibrant colors of the leaves are enhanced to create a visually striking and lively composition. This exaggerated scaling and coloring contribute to the whimsical nature of the diorama inside the dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, shiny, crystal-like beads visible on the surface of the leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves have multiple small, shiny, crystal-like beads on them. These beads resemble water droplets or decorative crystals, adding to the aesthetic appeal and texture of the scene. Such elements enrich the visual experience by providing a sense of detail and dimension to the depicted environment.",

      "question": "Is there a tiny human figure on a different branch, holding a sketchbook or drawing tool and facing the parrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tiny human figure is present on a branch within the dome. This figure appears to be holding a sketchbook or drawing instrument and is seated towards the top of the branch, facing the chibi-style parrot. The presence of such miniature human figures often adds an element of storytelling to dioramas, indicating an interaction with the environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the glass dome has a distinct wooden texture with artistic carved or etched tribal patterns. This design choice adds to the aesthetic quality of the diorama, providing an earthy, natural feel which is consistent with the rainforest theme implied by the lively foliage and exotic parrot.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the diorama include visual elements such as dense foliage, mist, or warm ambient lighting that suggest a rainforest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diorama includes lush, large leaves and vibrant colors indicative of dense foliage, closely associated with rainforest environments. Though mist is not discernible, the bright and vibrant presentation combined with these elements creates an illusion of a warm, rainforest-like ambiance, a common setting for showcasing exotic wildlife like parrots.",
