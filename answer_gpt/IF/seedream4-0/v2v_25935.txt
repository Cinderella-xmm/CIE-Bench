    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image maintain the original composition and perspective of the urban street scene?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the composition and perspective, Image B mirrors Image A's original urban street scene with a similar angle and layout. Image A shows the back of a man walking down an urban street with a cobblestone path and buildings lined on either side. Image B replicates this setup using Lego, preserving the same back view of the figure strolling down a similarly cobbled path with Lego buildings aligning the street. This suggests that the edited image maintains the original composition and perspective.",
