      "question": "Have the three sheep been converted into chibi characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three sheep visible in Image A have been transformed into chibi-style characters. Chibi is a style of drawing that often features characters with exaggerated facial features and smaller bodies to convey cuteness. The sheep in the edited image display these characteristics, with large heads and minimal details consistent with chibi art, confirming the transformation.",

      "question": "Do the chibi characters have scarves, earmuffs, and gloves added as winter accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are depicted wearing accessories such as scarves, earmuffs, and gloves. These items signal winter apparel, contributing to the wintry environment shown in the background. This appropriately dresses the characters for a winter setting, which is an artistic addition not present on the real sheep in Image A.",

      "question": "Has the interaction pose of the chibi characters by the railing been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi characters maintain a similar interaction pose to that of the sheep in Image A. The orientation of the chibi characters aligns with the railing, resembling how the sheep are positioned in the original, suggesting the pose has been preserved in the conversion to a cartoon style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chibi characters depicted in a flat, cartoonish style with thick outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows chibi characters drawn in a cartoonish style that employs flat colors and thick outlines. This style is typical of a simplified cartoon aesthetic, focusing on clear, bold shapes and lines to emphasize the characters' form over realism, distinguishing it significantly from the more realistic depiction in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image transparent for sticker use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, signs point to the background being transparent, such as the presence of a faint checkerboard overlay often used to indicate transparency in image editing. This implies the image is designed for sticker usage or overlaying on different backgrounds.",
