      "question": "Is the background changed to a matte solid gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a uniform, solid gray without any visible texture or variations, indicating that it is a matte finish. This is in contrast to any background details that might have been present in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the absence of depth or darkness around the elephant and the rock surface suggests there are no visible shadows. Shadows typically indicate the direction of light and add dimensionality, which appears to be lacking here.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the banana shape and metal stand curves highlighted effectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The notable curves in the image are related to the elephant's body and trunk rather than any banana shape or metal stand. The detail of these curves is highlighted but doesn't specifically relate to a banana or metal stand. If compared with Image A, similar shapes are still visible but not specifically highlighted to emphasize those features.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is prominently centered with a solid gray background, indicating a focus on minimalism by removing distractions and emphasizing the subject. This design approach aligns with minimalistic principles.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "The image has a clean, solid background that draws attention to the elephant without any clutter or additional objects, fulfilling the expectations of minimalistic design standards, which prioritize simplicity and focus.",
