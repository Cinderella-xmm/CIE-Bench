      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the shoe now rendered as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a fabric and rubber athletic shoe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe's material appears hard and resembles wood, with an emphasis on texture that mimics natural wood grain. This suggests that the shoe is depicted as a wooden sculpture rather than an athletic shoe made of fabric and rubber.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe is presented in a uniform light brown tone typical of wood, without the use of varying dark and light tones. Therefore, it does not mimic the original black and gray colors found in Image A.",
