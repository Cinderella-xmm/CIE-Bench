      "question": "Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sock is composed of multiple interlocking LEGO-style bricks, which is evident from the recognizable shape and texture of the blocks that make up the structure. The bricks fit together in the typical LEGO fashion, creating a pixelated representation of the original sock shape. This aligns with world knowledge of how LEGO constructions appear, confirming the analysis that the sock is fully constructed from these interlocking bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black, gray, and white patterns seen in Image A have been recreated using the LEGO bricks' colors. The patterns match the original sock's design, but the use of the blocky LEGO shapes results in a pixelated version of these patterns. This demonstrates the retention of the original color scheme through the constraints of the LEGO form.",

      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B shows a construction where LEGO bricks are aligned in a way to create a three-dimensional form. However, each brick layer seems to have uniform height, typical of LEGO structures, which doesn't explicitly vary in height for creating depth, only in shape for the sock form. Hence, while it is a three-dimensional object, the varying heights for depth are not pronounced.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top end of the sock, there is an orange piece, visibly distinct in shape and style that adheres to the structure of a LEGO block. Recognizing the common LEGO color and form is consistent with the construction pattern of the entire sock sculpture.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sock sculpture is displayed on a white pedestal in a spacious environment with bare walls and minimal exterior elements, reflecting characteristics of a gallery-like space. The background is free from clutter or any distracting elements, creating a clear focus on the sculpture itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B is made of rows of LEGO bricks that are aligned to form a clear and intentional structural shape of a sock. The edges are defined, and the bricks are systematically arranged to maintain the form and patterns of the original sock. The architecture of the piece reflects careful attention to detail to accurately represent the sock's form.",
