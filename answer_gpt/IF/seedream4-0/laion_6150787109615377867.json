      "question": "Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop is adorned with gear-like teeth around the perimeter and features intricate engravings, distinct from a typical flat table surface. This design evokes the aesthetic of mechanical precision and artistry, common in steampunk imagery. In contrast, Image A depicts a plain, smooth tabletop with a simple metallic pattern. Therefore, comparing these descriptions, it is evident that the tabletop has been replaced in Image B with a gear-shaped component detailed with engravings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the table legs been morphed into articulated, piston-driven limbs with visible joints and brass or copper-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the supporting structure consists of complex, articulated limbs that resemble mechanical pistons, complete with visible joints and components that showcase copper and brass tones. This transformation is aligned with the steampunk aesthetic of mechanical intricacy. Image A, on the other hand, displays straightforward, static legs with a polished metal finish devoid of such mechanical complexity. The contrast between the two images confirms that the table legs have indeed been morphed into limb-like structures with mechanical joints and metallic accents in Image B.",

      "question": "Are there visible steam vents placed along the central column of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows steam emanating from vents positioned along the table's central column, aligning with the steampunk theme of steam-powered machinery. This is a stark departure from Image A's plain, single-support column that lacks any such steam vent features. Comparing these observations confirms that Image B includes steam vents along the central column, emphasizing the visual theme.",

      "question": "Does the base feature intricate cog patterns and at least one rotating dial or gauge element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of Image B is adorned with a complex array of cogwheels and multiple gauge elements, which adds to the steampunk machinery aesthetic. These elements suggest functionality and mechanical depth. In contrast, Image A features a simple, featureless table base without any such patterns or dials. The differences highlight that the base in Image B embraces intricate cog designs and includes rotating gauges, contributing to the mechanized look.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table has been aesthetically and functionally transformed into a steampunk-style entity, complete with moving parts, articulated limbs, gears, and steam vents that suggest a living mechanical creature. These elements are consistent with the fantasy of machines that mimic organic life, typical in steampunk design. Image A, on the other hand, lacks these characteristics, simply presenting a utilitarian table without any anthropomorphic or mechanical enhancements. Thus, the transformation in Image B into a steampunk mechanized form is clear.",
