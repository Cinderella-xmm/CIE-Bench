      "question": "Is the basketball player depicted in a stylized cartoon form with exaggerated muscles and dynamic pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player is clearly depicted in a stylized cartoon form. The muscles are exaggerated, especially around the arms and legs, which is common in cartoon illustrations to emphasize the physicality and dynamism of the character. The stance and pose are dynamic, suggesting movement and athleticism. This transformation from the more realistic portrayal in Image A indicates a deliberate choice to enhance the cartoon-like appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the basketball player's outfit and surroundings in neon tones that complement the vibrant graffiti background. The colors are saturated and bold, creating a cohesive and visually striking appearance that matches the bright and colorful street art scene. In contrast, Image A employs more muted and realistic colors, indicating an intentional use of neon tones in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is there a blank graffiti-style text area present on the side of the image suitable for adding custom messages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable blank white rectangular area on the side of the image. This space resembles a canvas or a section of graffiti, indicating an area designed for customization or adding messages, commonly found in street art where artists might leave room for text or signatures. Image A lacks any such designated text area, showcasing the added element in the edited version.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image feature visual elements such as spray-paint textures, graffiti fonts, or vibrant contrast that enhance the street art vibe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly emphasizes visual elements associated with street art, including vibrant contrasts and the graffiti art style on the wall. The textures and styles resemble those typical of spray-paint artwork, enhancing the urban and street art vibe that permeates the scene. Image A offers a realistic representation without the added enhancements of the edited version, which clearly utilizes these artistic techniques.",

      "question": "Is the basketball player clearly identifiable in a basketball setting with a hoop and court, even after the stylistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, despite its cartoon transformation, maintains clear references to a basketball setting. The player is positioned on a court, with the visible hoop in the background, directly associating the setting with the sport. This clarity sustains the basketball theme, similar to Image A, where these elements are straightforwardly depicted.",
