    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the overall shape of the sofa been transformed into a fantastical cloud creature with plush, pillow-like formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape resembles a cloud creature with cloudy, fluffy textures. The visual impression is that of a soft, ethereal formation rather than a solid furniture item. The transformation is significant as the original rigid, structured form typical of a sofa is replaced with an organic, cloud-like shape.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the leather texture been replaced with soft, swirling cloud-like textures throughout the cushioned areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface texture in Image B communicates a change from the original leather to a swirling, soft cloud-like texture. Instead of the smooth, shiny surface associated with leather, there are swirling patterns resembling cloud formations, indicating a complete transformation of texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the wooden legs and armrests been transformed into branching, wind-like structures that resemble gusts of air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows elements that seem to be branching out from the cloud creature, resembling tree branches more than wind or air. These branches do not reflect the structure or appearance of wooden sofa legs and arms, thus they do not specifically resemble gusts of air.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there whimsical eyes visibly placed on the cushions of the cloud creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains black circular forms that appear to be eyes embedded in the cloud-like structure, giving the creature a whimsical and animated appearance. These elements strongly suggest the presence of eyes on the cloud creature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flowing mist trail extending from the back of the cloud creature, giving the impression of ethereal flight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is a visual element rising from the back of the cloud creature resembling mist or smoke, suggesting movement or flight. This feature contributes to the fantastical notion of the creature being in motion or possibly hovering, aligning with the concept of ethereal flight.",
