      "question": "Has the central structure been replaced with a digital billboard featuring luminous panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure appears as a large digital billboard with luminous panels emitting bright neon colors, notably blue and pink. This indicates a thematic shift towards digital or cyberpunk design, differing from what one might expect in a more natural or traditional setting. Thus, the visual evidence clearly suggests that the structure has been transformed into a digital billboard.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic neon animations on the digital billboard surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the billboard in Image B shows bright neon colors and patterns, suggesting movement or dynamic changes typical of neon animations. This dynamic visual presence implies that there are indeed animations on the billboard's surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the natural overgrowth been replaced with synthetic, glowing foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the areas around the base of the billboard have foliage that emits a neon-like glow, indicating a synthetic quality. This luminescent characteristic is different from typical natural growth, pointing to an artificial transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original architectural angles and structural geometry preserved in the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the central structure has been converted into a digital billboard, the overall angular shape and geometry of its base and frame are maintained, suggesting an underlying continuity in architecture despite the visual transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the surrounding buildings feature metallic facades and visible augmented reality elements such as holograms or digital overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding buildings do not visibly present metallic facades or holographic elements despite the visual transformation of the central structure. The buildings appear similar to typical urban architecture without distinct digital overlays, indicating that they lack augmented reality features.",
