      "question": "Is the background of the image now a flat white studio background instead of a sandy beach?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be uniformly white and featureless, consistent with a studio setup where subjects are often photographed against a plain backdrop to eliminate distractions. This contrasts with varied textures and gradients expected in a natural setting like a sandy beach. Using common knowledge, studio backgrounds are often white to isolate the subject, further confirming this observation.",
