      "question": "Is the spaceship visually transformed into a style resembling a Greek amphora painting, with flat, stylized forms and decorative borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spaceship seems to have been replaced entirely by a Greek amphora. The amphora is consistent with ancient pottery styles, featuring flat, stylized forms and decorative painted borders typical of Greek designs. The transformation does indeed mirror the style of Greek amphora painting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible stylized circular motifs incorporated into the design of the spaceship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a Greek amphora instead of the spaceship, with visible circular motifs as part of its design. These circular motifs are consistent with the patterns often seen on ancient Greek pottery. Thus, the stylized circular motifs are present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spaceship include intricate meander patterns as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Greek amphora replaces the spaceship, with visible meander patterns on the body of the amphora. This is a common decorative element in Greek pottery, known for its detailed meander designs. Therefore, intricate meander patterns are part of the new design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the landscape below been transformed into elongated abstract waveforms rather than realistic terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape beneath the amphora has been stylized into elongated and abstract waveforms. Unlike realistic terrain, these waveforms have a fluid, artistic representation, evocative of artistic renditions found in stylized illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the color palette of the landscape composed primarily of muted earth tones consistent with ancient pottery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette of the landscape is composed of muted earth tones, which complement the Greek amphora theme. These tones are consistent with those typically used in ancient pottery, providing an overall harmonious and thematic visual presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original spaceship is replaced by a Greek amphora. However, the spatial relationship between the object (amphora) and the stylized landscape remains visually consistent, maintaining a similar orientation and depth relationship as seen with the spaceship in Image A.",
