        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the container is cylindrical in shape, distinct from the curved and complex conventional teapot shape. This transformation into a cylindrical shape is visually clear, indicating a major design change. The reasoning is based on the visual cues that show a shift from a traditional rounded to a cylindrical form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a metallic screw cap instead of the conventional hinged lid that would typically be found on a teapot. This can be deduced from the image showing a thread-like structure under the cap and its cylindrical design, implying a screw mechanism.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the screw cap does not exhibit intricate tea leaf patterns around its circumference. The visual cues show a plain surface, leading to the conclusion that there are no tea leaf patterns embossed on the cap.",
