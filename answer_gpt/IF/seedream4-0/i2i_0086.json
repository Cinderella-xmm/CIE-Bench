      "question": "Has a butterfly been added above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a butterfly is visible above the center of the mirror. This conclusion is drawn from observing the reflection and placement of objects within the scene.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B appears to have a golden hue, which can be determined by examining the color and reflective qualities of the butterfly's wings. This perception of color matches the golden appearance associated with bright, metallic-like tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly is situated above the mirror as evident in Image B. This is determined by assessing the relative positioning within the image, where the butterfly is clearly placed at the top portion of the mirror, not to the sides or bottom.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's golden coloration complements the warm lighting that surrounds the mirror, creating visual harmony. This blending is logical since both share warm tones, suggesting a cohesive integration of the butterfly into the lighting environment.",
