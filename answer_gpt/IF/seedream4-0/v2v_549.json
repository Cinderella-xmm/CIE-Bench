      "question": "Is the Funko Pop-style box shown in an isometric view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the Funko Pop-style box is shown in an isometric view, we examine the perspective and angles visible in the image. An isometric view typically presents the object at an angle where the sides are all visible and parallel lines do not converge. In the edited image (Image B), the box is presented in such a manner, as we can see three sides (front, top, and one side) clearly, and the lines appear parallel rather than converging. This suggests an isometric view.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure of the baseball player hold a bat and wear a helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure of the baseball player is depicted standing outside the box. The figure is holding a bat with one hand and is wearing a helmet, which are clear indicators of typical baseball attire and equipment. This aligns with the common portrayal of baseball players in chibi or toy style.",

      "question": "Are a ball and glove included as signature elements accompanying the chibi-style figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we see the chibi-style figure with a baseball bat in hand, as well as the presence of a baseball beside the figure's feet. These are signature elements often associated with baseball. The glove is not visible in the image. Therefore, while there is a ball present, the glove is not included as an accompanying element in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is depicted outside of the box, but it's presented in a stylized and simplified manner typical of chibi figures, with smooth surfaces and exaggerated features. The figure does not have realistic textures or details that mimic reality; instead, it remains within the stylized art form with basic shading and highlights.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title on the packaging in Image B is clearly visible and reads 'BASEBALL LEGEND.' This text is prominently displayed on the front of the box, indicating it as the product name or title, which is typical in toy packaging.",
