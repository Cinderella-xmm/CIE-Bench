      "question": "Are the mountains visibly reimagined as a stone-carved body with moss forming distinct fur-like patterns across their surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original mountain peaks have been transformed into a fantastical stone-carved creature. The appearance resembles a mythological animal or beast, with a large body, and moss is strategically placed to give an impression of fur across its surface. This reimagining deviates significantly from natural mountains and clearly shows a creative transformation into a stone-carved body with fur-like moss patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lake appear as a reflective surface mirroring the sky, with visible mystical symbols embedded within its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror-like reflection is visible on the centerpiece of the creature, not the lake, so the lake retains its natural appearance without mystical symbols. The question seems to confuse the creature's mirror with the lake's surface. Thus, the lake does not have embedded mystical symbols in its reflection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are twisted rock horns visibly present atop the mountain peaks, distinct from the original rock formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the stone-carved creature with two distinct, twisted rock horns protruding from its head. This is a clear artistic addition, as such formations are not typical in natural mountain peaks and were not present in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the original pathways appear as glowing, luminescent lines running across the terrain, resembling veins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathways or lines originally seen in the landscape have been transformed into glowing, luminescent lines that resemble veins. This artistic edit gives them an otherworldly appearance compared to the natural trails in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grassy slopes replaced with textured, shimmering scales that exhibit a celestial or iridescent hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy slopes have been transformed into scales that cover the creature, exhibiting a shimmering and iridescent quality, which is reflective of celestial or otherworldly themes. This is a drastic change from the grassy appearance in Image A.",
