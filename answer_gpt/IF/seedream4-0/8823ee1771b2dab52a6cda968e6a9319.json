      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the figurine in Image B, with an arm resting on a column, mirrors the figure's original pose in Image A. This consistency suggests the same intent was translated into the ceramic rendition.",

    },
    {
