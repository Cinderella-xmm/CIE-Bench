      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a 3D chibi-style figure emerging from the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can see a small figure with exaggerated and cute features sitting inside the kayak. This style is often referred to as 'chibi,' which is a common style in Japanese animation and involves characters with large heads and small bodies. The presence of this figure suggests that it is emerging or has been placed in the kayak.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure appear to be crossing the kayakâ€™s edge and stepping into the real-world environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is seated entirely within the kayak, holding a paddle, and does not appear to be crossing over its edge or interacting with the environment outside of the kayak. Therefore, it remains inside the photograph, not crossing into the real world.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scene framed within a Polaroid photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the kayak and skateboard scene captured within a white-bordered square, reminiscent of a real-world Polaroid photo. This apparent framing suggests that the scene has been captured in a manner typical of instant film photography.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible human hand holding the white-bordered photograph featuring the kayak and skateboard. This interaction suggests that the Polaroid is part of a larger scene, with the hand bringing the photograph into context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, both the yellow kayak and the skateboard remain in the same positions and are easily recognizable. Despite the addition of the chibi-style figure, the original objects have not been altered or removed.",
