    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser is clearly constructed using LEGO bricks, as evidenced by the characteristic small brick shapes and seams typical of LEGO construction. The primary colors visible are shades of brown for the main body and gold for the decorative accents. This analysis is based on the visible interlocking pieces and the color scheme, which align with common LEGO brick colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?",
    "explanation": "The decorative patterns on the front of the dresser in Image B appear to be constructed using small, interlocking LEGO pieces. The shapes and outlines mimic ornate designs, and the texture confirms the use of LEGO bricks. This observation is made by noting the jagged edges and intricate pattern, consistent with LEGO assembly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the curved sides and legs of the dresser constructed using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the dresser mimics curves, it is constructed using standard LEGO bricks, which traditionally have a block-like, stepped appearance rather than smooth curves. Although some sloped bricks may be used, the typical LEGO construction results in a more angular and less smooth appearance than a non-LEGO object.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Has the marble top been replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the top of the dresser is composed of gray flat LEGO tiles, which replace the original marble top seen in Image A. The texture is consistent with the flat, studded surface of LEGO plates.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the dresser placed on a neutral, plain background that does not distract from the LEGO structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a simple, neutral beige color that keeps focus on the LEGO dresser without introducing any distracting elements. This aids in highlighting the structure itself clearly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the LEGO dresser maintain the original two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs around each drawer?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO dresser in Image B replicates the two-drawer layout with ornate design elements around each drawer using LEGO bricks. The ornate frames mimic the shapes seen in the original dresser design, suggesting an attempt to maintain the original look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all surfaces of the dresser visibly composed of LEGO bricks, with no realistic wood or metal textures?",
    "explanation": "All visible surfaces in Image B are composed of LEGO bricks, displaying the distinct texture and appearance of LEGO pieces. There is no depiction of realistic wood or metal textures, confirming the exclusive use of LEGO material for the dresser's construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
