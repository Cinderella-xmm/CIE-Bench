      "question": "Is the warrior statue composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with visible brick-like elements forming its body, limbs, and head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is clearly constructed using LEGO bricks, evidenced by the visible brick-like elements and the interlocking nature of the components. The entire figure, including the body, limbs, and head, displays the familiar appearance of LEGO construction with distinct brick shapes and seams, indicating a complete transformation into a LEGO composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the primary colors used in the statue limited to shades of brown and tan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features colors within the brown and tan spectrum. These colors are consistently present across the different parts of the LEGO statue, which includes the body, armor, and accessories. The lack of any other prominent color suggests a deliberate choice to maintain a palette limited to these shades, likely to mimic a wooden or earthy appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armor sections (such as chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards) made of smooth LEGO bricks without surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the armor sections of the LEGO statue, such as the chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards, which are made from standard LEGO bricks known for their smooth surfaces. Unlike sculpted materials with detailed textures, LEGO bricks typically have a uniform, smooth finish due to their plastic construction.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental details such as the headdress, necklace, and carvings on the torso created using textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details, including the headdress, necklace, and torso carvings, are fashioned from typical LEGO bricks that lack texture and visible patterns seen in traditionally carved details. Instead, these elements depend on the arrangement and color variation of regular, smooth LEGO bricks to imply detail, as LEGO generally does not have textured surfaces.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO statue positioned on a plain white pedestal with no decorative elements, located in a gallery environment with framed artworks on the walls and track lighting overhead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO statue is indeed placed on a plain white pedestal with no additional decorative elements. The surrounding environment is a gallery space, evidenced by the framed artworks hanging on the walls and the presence of track lighting on the ceiling, which is common in exhibition settings.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO statue retain the same standing posture, facial expression, and proportional dimensions as the original wooden warrior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparison of Image B with Image A, the LEGO statue maintains the same basic standing posture and general proportions as the original wooden statue. The position of the limbs and body structure is replicated, although the facial expression is not discernible due to the lack of facial detail typical of LEGO figures. However, the overall posture and proportions are faithfully maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the statue visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, with no continuous surfaces resembling carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the statue constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, marked by visible seams where the bricks connect, typical of LEGO construction. This contrasts with the continuous, seamless surfaces typical of carved wood seen in traditional sculptures. The bricks' outlines and the distinct LEGO appearance confirm the interlocking brick nature of the construction.",
