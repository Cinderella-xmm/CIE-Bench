        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase and sunflowers are positioned centrally and prominently, drawing the viewer's eye. Their vivid colors and scale relative to other elements in the image help maintain them as the focal point. This emphasizes that they remain the primary focus.",
