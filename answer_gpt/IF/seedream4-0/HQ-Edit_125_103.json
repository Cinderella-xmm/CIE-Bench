      "question": "Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main object is no longer a traditional rounded teapot like in Image A, but rather a tall, cylindrical container. This is evident from the straight sides and uniform circular shape, which is characteristic of a cylinder, in contrast to the original rounded teapot shape seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are floral patterns embossed in golden foil on the surface of the teapot container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical container is covered in a golden foil, and floral patterns are visibly embossed onto its surface. The gold can be identified through the shiny, metallic appearance, which is not present in Image A as that showcases a teapot with painted floral designs rather than embossed ones.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the teacups redesigned as nested stackable units, each with a decorative lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three teacups are shown stacked upon each other, which indicates that they are designed to be stackable. Additionally, the topmost unit features a decorative lid, suggesting the redesign to include this functionality, unlike the traditional single teacups seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there Japanese calligraphy displayed across the top of the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cylindrical container with a top that showcases Japanese calligraphy. This can be recognized by the presence of Japanese characters on the lid, which is a common feature in traditional Japanese packaging design for tea, differing from Image A, which does not have such inscriptions on its teapot.",

      "question": "Is a bamboo motif visible along the side of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side of the cylindrical container has a noticeable bamboo motif, recognized by the depiction of bamboo stalks and leaves, aligning with traditional Asian aesthetic themes. In comparison, Image A has a floral design without the inclusion of bamboo motifs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire tea set packaging presented on a flat white surface with no other background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the tea set packaging on a plain flat white surface, which is clearly visible due to the absence of additional background elements. This contrasts with Image A, where the teapot is set against a textured background typical of traditional Japanese settings, such as tatami mats.",
