      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is text overlay at the bottom of the image which appears to be a poetic description. This addition is seen on the branch where the bird is perched.

The choice of font does not distract from the visual subject but rather complements it, providing a balance between the visual elements and the text.",
