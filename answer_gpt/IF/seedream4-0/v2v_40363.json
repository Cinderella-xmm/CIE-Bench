      "question": "Is the entire image composed of small, distinct mosaic tiles with visible grout lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each element of the image is divided into small, distinct units that resemble mosaic tiles. These tiles have visible grout lines between them. This is typical of mosaic art, where small pieces of colored material are used to create a larger image. The presence of grout lines and the uniformity of the tiles supports the analysis that they are indeed mosaic tiles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vivid and saturated, particularly the red heart balloon and the child's features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors appear bold and well-defined. The red heart balloon and other parts of the image such as the blue and yellow background are vivid and highly saturated, typical of ceramic mosaics. This suggests an intentional use of vibrant colors to make the image stand out.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the heart balloon and the child clearly defined and emphasized in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct outlines around the heart balloon and the child's form. The mosaic style enhances these outlines in a pronounced manner with strong contour lines created by black grout. This feature is common in mosaics, where outlines are often used to define and differentiate various elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and all essential elements from the original image been maintained in the mosaic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition mirrors Image A closely. The heart balloon, the child, and their positions and orientations are kept consistent in the mosaic interpretation. All major elements, including the child's arm reaching for the balloon, are preserved effectively, showcasing similarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the material of the artwork reflect the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles, such as a glossy or matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual pieces have a textured finish suggestive of ceramic materials, which often have a glossy or matte surface. The reflection and finish observed in the tiles imply a texture consistent with ceramic mosaic tiles.",
