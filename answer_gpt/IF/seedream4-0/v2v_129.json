      "question": "Are the stickers arranged in a neat 3x3 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stickers are clearly arranged in three rows and three columns, forming a 3x3 grid. The consistent alignment and spacing between the stickers suggest a deliberate and neat arrangement. This is a straightforward visual observation that doesn't require additional world knowledge.",

      "question": "Is the background of the stickers transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B appear to be placed on a transparent background as indicated by the checkerboard pattern surrounding them. The checkerboard pattern is commonly used to represent transparency in image editing software. This conclusion is drawn from recognizing this pattern through world knowledge.",

      "question": "Do all stickers maintain a square, 1:1 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon visual inspection, each sticker in Image B seems to have equal width and height, forming a square shape. This consistency across all stickers suggests a uniform aspect ratio of 1:1, which is common for sticker designs. This observation is made by assessing the visual symmetry and shape uniformity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker in Image B depicts a character engaged in different activities, such as painting or drawing, along with varying facial expressions indicative of different emotions and artistic themes. This conclusion is based on recognizing the variety of depicted actions, expressions, and the artistic context inherent in the illustrations.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stickers that each have a consistent white border around them, enhancing their prominence on the transparent background. This uniform outline is observable across all stickers, indicating a standardized design choice often used for stickers to enhance visibility and separation from backgrounds.",
