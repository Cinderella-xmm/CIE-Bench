      "question": "Does the edited image feature bold black outlines around figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited version, the figures and objects such as the kimono, trees, and pathway elements are surrounded by prominent black outlines. This style is reminiscent of traditional Japanese woodblock prints (ukiyo-e), where bold outlines are characteristic to define shapes and forms clearly and distinctively.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors on the kimono appear flat and uniform, lacking the intricate gradients and realistic shading that are present in Image A. This flat coloring style is typical of ukiyo-e prints, where patterns are often applied with a consistent tone without the illusion of depth created by shading.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted with simplified shapes and muted pink hues rather than vibrant or detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are illustrated using simplified forms and muted pink tones, contrasting with the vibrant, detailed renderings in Image A. This approach aligns with the style of traditional ukiyo-e, where nature is often depicted using stylized and simplified shapes instead of high realism.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays path stones and poles with visible textured patterns that appear reminiscent of hand-carved designs often found in woodblock prints. This texture differentiates them from Image Aâ€™s realistic depiction and suggests a traditional art influence.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant hills are drawn in a stylized and simplified manner, consistent with ukiyo-e compositions. This cultural art style often features exaggerated forms and uniform color palettes, focusing more on aesthetic representation than realistic detail.",
