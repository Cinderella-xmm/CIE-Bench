        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skirt appears fuller and reaches closer to the edges of the image, indicating a size enlargement. The length and width of the dress exceed those in Image A, showing more volume and extending longer. This is evident from the added fabric and lace at the bottom. Considering the visuality, the skirt’s end extends further, giving the impression of larger size.",
