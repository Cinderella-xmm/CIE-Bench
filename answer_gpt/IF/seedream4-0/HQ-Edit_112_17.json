      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools have a glossy, smooth appearance that resembles enamel. This is a significant change from the more rustic and worn look in Image A.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "The textured linen background in Image B provides a soft and neutral base that sets off the glossy, colorful appearance of the enamel tools. This contrast enhances the enamel's visual appeal, creating a harmonious composition that highlights the tools' bright, smooth surfaces.",
