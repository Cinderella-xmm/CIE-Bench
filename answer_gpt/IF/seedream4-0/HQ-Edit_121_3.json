    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the butterfly been transformed into a creature that visually resembles a floral being, with no recognizable insectoid body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original butterfly's body structure is no longer evident. Instead, it has been artistically transformed into a floral appearance with wings resembling flower petals and a body that imitates a plant stalk. Traditional insect features like segmented bodies or rigid wings are absent, reinforcing its floral essence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings appear folded into distinct, vibrant petal-like structures instead of flat, membranous insect wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are transformed into what appear to be folded and layered structures that mimic the texture and color variations of flower petals, in contrast to the flat, membrane-like appearance typical of insect wings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the butterfly's body now resemble a thin, upright flower stalk rather than an insectâ€™s segmented torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central body in Image B no longer replicates the segmented and bulbous form customary of butterfly torsos. Instead, it imitates an elongated plant stem, adding to the overall floral motif of the edited creature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original wing patterns replaced with detailed, naturalistic leaf designs across the entire surface of the wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are embellished with leaf patterns that traverse their entire surface. These replace the geometric and spotty wing patterns found on butterfly wings, opting for a naturalistic leaf motif instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible tendril-like structures extending from the tips of the butterfly's antennae?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antennae in Image B are transformed into curling, tendril-like structures that resemble plant tendrils rather than the straight or modestly curved antennae seen on insects. These suggest plant-like growth, aligning with the overall floral theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small blossoms visibly attached to the edges of the wings and at the foot/lowest part of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Small blossoms are carefully integrated into the design in Image B, positioned at the edges of the wings and the base of the creature. These additions further the floral aesthetic by complementing the leaf and petal elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background identical to the original image, featuring the same meadow with pink coneflowers, golden grasses, and blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B matches that of Image A, showcasing a consistent setting of meadowland equipped with pink coneflowers, golden grasses, and a bluish sky, maintaining continuity in the natural environment.",
