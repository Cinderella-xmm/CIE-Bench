      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle is clearly situated inside a glass dome.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle has distinct textures and lines that indicate it is a sculpture. The material has a glossy, polished look typical of crafted objects, and the details on the eagle's body, such as the sharp lines and textures on the feathers, suggest it has been sculpted. This matches the description of a 3D stylized sculpture.",
