        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image clearly shows a wall sticker that replicates the core visual elements of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' as seen in Image A. The swirling patterns, star shapes, and general composition reflect the original painting, which suggests that the sticker has been designed to maintain the main motifs of the artwork.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wall sticker with certain areas, particularly the stars and moon, appearing to be more luminous, akin to a glow-in-the-dark effect. This suggests that these areas are designed to emit light, indicating their functionality to glow in darkness.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the wall sticker on a textured wall above a bed with pillows, flanked by bedside lamps. This setting is typical of a bedroom, and the placement of the art piece above the bed on the wall is consistent with a feature wall d√©cor in such a setting.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
