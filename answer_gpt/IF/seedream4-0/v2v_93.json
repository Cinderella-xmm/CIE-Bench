      "question": "Is the thermometer depicted in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the thermometer features a glossy, rounded appearance, with exaggerated dimensions for parts like the needle and a bulbous end, which are stylistic features often found in 3D cartoon representations. The overall design conveys a sense of playfulness, which aligns with the 3D cartoon aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] clearly incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, there is a clearly defined banner that reads 'Precision Thermal Gauge'. The banner is styled to catch attention at the top of the gauge, making it immediately noticeable as a part of the thermometer's presentation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a designated area at the bottom that functions as a nameplate, providing specific details about the thermometer’s capabilities, including stats like 'Temperature Range +200'. This inclusion acts as a textual identifier for the item.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B consists of soft, bluish tones, which are often associated with professionalism, technical environments, and scientific settings. These hues complement the content by conveying a sense of precision and clarity.",
