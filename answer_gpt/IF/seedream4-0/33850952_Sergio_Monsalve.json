      "question": "Does the building facade now appear as an organic, alien-like structure rather than a conventional architectural design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the building has been transformed to appear more organic and alien-like. The introduction of tentacle-like appendages and scale-like patterns suggests a departure from conventional architectural designs, giving an impression of an alien or biological structure. The use of iridescent surfaces further enhances this perception by mimicking features often associated with exotic or sci-fi elements. This transformation signifies a shift from a simple architectural facade to a more complex, imaginative design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the curved elements of the building transformed into distinct tentacle-like appendages extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the curved elements of the building altered to resemble tentacle-like appendages. These extensions resemble organic limbs, promoting a sense of movement and life that is atypical for architectural elements, indicating a stylistic change towards an organic appearance. In this case, common architectural structures are replaced by designs that trigger associations with creatures featuring tentacles or other similar limb arrangements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are fibrous, strand-like textures visibly applied across sections of the buildingâ€™s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior of the building is adorned with fibrous, strand-like textures, introducing an element of disarray and organic complexity that contrasts with typical architectural surfaces. These textures add depth and bring an organic feel, suggesting materials like moss or external growth. This texture alteration is characteristic of designs aiming to blend structural entities with natural or alien aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all window surfaces been replaced with translucent, membrane-like panels that appear soft and non-rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does feature significant alterations to the building's exterior, the window surfaces largely retain their clear, glass-like characteristic rather than being entirely replaced by membrane-like panels. The translucency present does not fully evoke the softness or non-rigid quality typically of bio-membrane materials. Thus, the basic visual characteristics of the windows themselves remain unchanged in terms of their perceived material properties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal surface detailed with overlapping, iridescent scale-like patterns that reflect multiple colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the building's metal surface covered in overlapping, scale-like patterns that display iridescence. These scales appear reflective and vary in color when viewed from different angles, contributing to the building's transformed characteristics. Such designs are reminiscent of fish scales or reptilian skin, enhancing the alien or fantasy-oriented transformation presented in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there glowing, bio-luminescent lines along the edges of the structure that emit an eerie, unnatural light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the building structure do indeed exhibit glowing lines, which appear to emit a soft, bio-luminescent light. The emitted glow adds to the perception of an unnatural, organic presence against the more solid structure, suggesting a transformation inspired by marine or extraterrestrial biology known for bioluminescence as witnessed in certain sea creatures. These glowing lines break from traditional architectural lighting, favoring a more mythical or sci-fi aesthetic.",
