      "question": "Is the title \"The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior\" displayed prominently in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the phrase 'The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior' is not displayed clearly or prominently. The visibility of the text is compromised, with parts being cut off or distorted. This indicates that the title is not effectively presented in a prominent manner.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich have bread armor and a leafy lettuce cape as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the central sandwich does not visually include elements that resemble 'armor made of bread' or a 'leafy lettuce cape.'

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, there is a series of small circular illustrations, possibly showing sequences or events, positioned at the bottom. These appear to reflect a form of timeline with related visuals. The style is whimsical and hand-drawn, adding a playful storytelling aspect to the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the narrative texts are rendered in an inconsistent, distorted font that does not fit the typical bold, comic-style font associated with clear storytelling. The text appears misaligned and stretched, undermining clarity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, vibrant and contrasting colors are effectively utilized to emphasize different elements such as the bread knight character, the ribbon across the sandwich, and the action icons. These bright colors help differentiate components within the image, drawing attention to various visual details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains circular icons that dynamically depict action scenes, likely intended as part of the narrative surrounding the bread warrior character. The placement of these icons adds visual interest and storytelling elements, confirming the design choice.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents various components such as the character of the bread knight, a central sandwich with the title text, and a timeline sequence at the bottom. Despite the distortions in the title text, these sections are meant to separate different narrative elements and story parts.",
