      "question": "Is the image formatted as an educational infographic with structured layout elements such as titles, labels, and text boxes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed as an educational infographic, which is evident from the presence of structured elements such as a prominent title at the top, labels pointing to different parts of the butterfly, and text boxes providing additional information. These are typical features of an infographic, aimed at educating the viewer on a specific topic.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'Butterfly Biology Basics' is prominently positioned at the top of Image B, representing the primary subject of the infographic. This placement is standard for titles within such layouts, ensuring it is immediately noticeable to viewers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax) labeled with monochrome line-drawing overlays on the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is overlaid with a monochrome line drawing that includes labels pointing to specific anatomical parts like antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax. This is in line with the goal of educational infographics to clearly identify and explain components of the subject matter.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are pink flower petals included in the image to represent the butterfly’s feeding preference?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the pink flower petals seen in the original image (Image A). While these petals remain present, in the context of an infographic, they likely suggest the depiction of the butterfly's natural environment or feeding habits.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains text boxes with information placed near the butterfly. While the exact content is illegible, the presence of these text boxes in an educational infographic format suggests they would include information on topics relevant to butterfly biology, such as pollination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, even with the overlay of the monochrome diagram and labels, maintains a delicate and aesthetically pleasing style. However, the vibrant blue of the original butterfly in Image A is mostly obscured by the line drawing, indicating that the color is not emphasized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original butterfly's form is largely covered by a monochrome line drawing. This means that while the shape and position of the butterfly are retained, its vibrant blue coloring and details are not clearly visible or intact, as they are obscured by the overlay.",
