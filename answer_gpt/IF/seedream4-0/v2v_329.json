      "question": "Are the bicycles depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles have a distinctly stylized and exaggerated appearance with simplified and rounded features, characteristic of the chibi style seen often in 3D animation and toy designs. The use of vibrant colors and the absence of fine detailing typical of real-world objects further support this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the bicycles retained their original arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the bicycles is visually similar to the structured layout seen in Image A, with each bicycle parallel and arranged from left to right. World knowledge about symmetrical and orderly compositions supports the analysis that the basic arrangement remains unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the bicycles identical to those in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles sport bold and playful shades of red, blue, yellow, and black, closely mirroring the colors in Image A. However, the tonal richness and nuances present in Image A give way to simplified and more saturated hues, aligning with the chibi style. Despite this, the basic color scheme remains intact between the images.",

      "question": "Do the bicycles retain their original design details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the bicycles maintain the basic frame shapes, the intricate parts, mechanical elements, and realistic detailing seen in Image A are simplified or absent, replaced by smoother, rounded edges and a more toy-like appearance, typical of chibi representations. This denotes a loss of the original design details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B depict bicycles inside a room with light streaming through a grid window, creating a reflection on a polished floor. While the chibi style in Image B affects the objects, the general scene composition—including the lighting similarity with soft shadows and warm window light, and the window's prominent framing—remains consistent with Image A.",
