    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented as a three-dimensional shadow box diorama with visible depth created by layered components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is designed to resemble a three-dimensional diorama, as evidenced by the layered effect achieved through various paper-like cut-outs. This technique provides a sense of depth, indicative of a shadow box style. This conclusion is drawn from the visual representation of elements at different planes within the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the skyline and foreground elements visibly separated into multiple layered paper cut-out sections to simulate depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the skyline and foreground appear to be divided into distinct sections that resemble paper cut-outs, creating a multi-layered, three-dimensional effect. This is evident from the way the elements stack upon one another, enhancing the perception of depth within the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the grassy lawn area been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface that shows reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassy lawn area in Image B still appears as grassy, with no indication of it being replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface. The reflections seen in water features do not apply to any grassy spots.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there numerous small, detailed, three-dimensional-looking pedestrian figures scattered throughout the scene, particularly on pathways and near the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes small figures that, while stylized and simplified to match the paper-cut motif, resemble pedestrians scattered across the scene. They add a sense of scale and detail in a three-dimensional context through their positioning and shadowing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene framed by a dark border with visible metallic edges, consistent with a shadow box enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is indeed outlined by a dark border that has metallic-like edges, mimicking the appearance of a shadow box. These edges give the impression of a framed display, distinct from the interior layers of the diorama.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are city names and geographic coordinates visibly engraved along the outer edge of the frame in fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, engraved details such as city names and coordinates are visible along the outer frame. These engravings lend an authentic touch, contributing to the perception of a meticulously crafted diorama.",
