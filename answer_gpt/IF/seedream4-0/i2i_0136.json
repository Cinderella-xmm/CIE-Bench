      "question": "Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object on the plate resembles an orange but appears to be made of a smooth, shiny material typically associated with plastic or rubber. It has an unnatural uniformity and gloss that is characteristic of manufactured items rather than natural produce. This suggests that it is likely a rubber keychain designed to resemble an orange.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the item has a small, green protrusion at the top which resembles the stem of a fruit. However, this stem is idealized and plastic-like, differing from the natural stem seen in real fruit. This indicates that it is a representation rather than the original natural stem.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain has a very glossy and smooth surface, typical for plastic items. Image A shows a natural orange with some gloss, but Image B's object has a more exaggerated and consistent shininess prevalent in synthetic materials, suggesting a more noticeable gloss is present in the keychain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the keychain visually recognizable as a citrus fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite being a synthetic object, the overall shape, size, and color scheme are reminiscent of an orange. The use of orange color and the presence of a green stem-like object aid in identifying it as a representation of a citrus fruit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain include a visible attachment point like a ring or clip for keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a metallic component on the top of the orange-like object, which is recognizable as a keyring or attachment clip for keys. This metal loop is typical in keychains for attaching keys, confirming its function as a keychain.",
