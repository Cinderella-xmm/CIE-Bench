      "question": "Is the bowl made of a transparent glass-like material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl appears to be made of a transparent material that resembles glass. This conclusion is drawn from the visible reflections and refractions that can be seen on the bowl’s surface, which are indicative of glass-like properties. The transparency also allows some light to pass through the bowl, contributing to its glass-like appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vegetables have a fresh and slightly damp surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots and cauliflower exhibit a surface texture that suggests freshness. This can be inferred from the presence of visible moisture droplets on the carrots, indicating a damp surface. The perceived gloss of the vegetables also contributes to the impression of a fresh state.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image show angled lighting from above with soft ambient fill, creating highlights and soft shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows lighting that seems to come from above, creating distinct highlights on the bowl and vegetables. The presence of soft shadows indicates the use of ambient fill lighting, which helps in providing depth and dimension without harsh contrasts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a neutral gray with a subtle vignette gradient and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is predominantly gray with a smooth texture. However, there is no clear evidence of a vignette gradient as the color doesn’t visibly transition towards the edges. The background seems uniformly gray without any discernible gradient effect.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the vegetables naturally vibrant with a soft glow effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the vegetables are quite vibrant, particularly the bright orange of the carrots. The presence of moisture, as conveyed by tiny water droplets, and the lighting contribute to a soft glow effect around the vegetables, enhancing their natural vibrancy.",
