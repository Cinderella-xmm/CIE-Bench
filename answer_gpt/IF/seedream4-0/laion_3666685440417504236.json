      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the architectural ensemble rendered as a scaled-down 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements, such as the dome and the arches, appear highly detailed and miniaturized relative to their surroundings. This is suggestive of a 3D model because in real life, such structures would be much larger. The visual cues like proportion and the way the structure is contained support the conclusion that this is a model rather than a life-sized representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 3D architectural model contained within a spherical ceramic globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the architectural model within a structure that has the shape of a partially open sphere with visible thickness at the cut. The interior of this structure hosts the model like a showcase, indicative of a spherical containment. This suggests the model is inside a ceramic globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the turquoise dome and ornate arches visibly enhanced with golden highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The turquoise dome and arches are present, and around them, there are golden highlights on the architectural details. The use of gold is not only in the arches but also subtly enhances the definition of these elements, contrasting sharply with the traditional stone or ceramic material typical in full-sized architecture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there miniature palm trees visible inside the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the spherical globe-like structure in Image B, there are several palm trees that appear to be of a proportion that matches the miniaturized scale of the model. Their size and arrangement are consistent with what would be expected in a model setting rather than a real landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a cobblestone path leading to the grand entrance inside the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A leading path is visible in front of the architectural model within the globe, comprised of what look like cobblestones consistent with typical design cues for a pathway leading to grand entrances. This detail aligns with traditional aesthetics in exterior architecture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the exterior of the ceramic globe decorated with intricate Persian patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible edge of the globe in Image B is adorned with ornate designs characteristic of Persian pattern styles, marked by their intricate detail and colorful motifs. Such decorations are commonly found in Persian art and are applied here to the ceramic surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the final composition present a visually cohesive blend of historical architecture and artistic design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a fusion of historically inspired architecture and artistic design elements. The model and the globe are seamlessly integrated, with the historical architecture appearing within an artistically stylized ceramic globe. This blend of miniaturized architectural design with decorative art fulfills criteria for visual cohesion.",
