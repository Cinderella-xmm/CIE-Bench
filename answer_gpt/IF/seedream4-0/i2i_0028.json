        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is characterized by soft lines and muted colors, which are indicative of an illustration rather than a realistic photograph. The use of this style often creates a gentle, artistic impression. Based on these visual cues, it is reasonable to conclude that the image is indeed redrawn in a soft illustration style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is clearly depicted sitting on a sofa, and the color can be identified as a light beige tone. Sofas in media and images are often neutral in color to blend into various settings, and the beige color here is typically perceived as neutral and warm. Comparing to Image A, where the sofa's color is similarly light, it confirms the knowledge that beige is a likely choice to describe this hue.",

      "question": "Are there three teddy bears dressed in red shirts with blessing texts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three teddy bears, each wearing a red shirt. On these shirts, there are visible texts with positive messaging or blessings. Such texts are common in gift items like teddy bears to convey friendliness and warmth. My understanding from observing the image is that each bear's shirt contains distinct messages, indicative of blessings or supportive statements. Image A reaffirms this description by showing the same number of bears and similar shirt design.",

      "question": "Is the handwritten text at the top of the image “Some friends come with hugs”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features text at the top, styled in a handwritten font. The phrase 'Some friends come with hugs' is clearly readable and fits the theme of the image, where teddy bears are typically associated with hugs and friendship. The artistic style of the text aligns with the soft illustration theme, aiming to invoke an emotional connection. This conclusion is drawn from directly observing Image B.",

      "question": "Does the image feature warm tones and soft lighting, creating a cozy atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of soft, warm colors contributes to an inviting and cozy atmosphere. Warm tones, such as beiges, soft browns, and the reds of the teddy bears, naturally give a sense of warmth and comfort, which is further enhanced by the soft lighting effect used in the illustration. This creates an overall mood of warmth and comfort, characteristic of cozy environments. These conclusions are drawn from the visual style and color choices in the image itself.",
