      "question": "Are there exactly three distinct postcards visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, there are four distinct rectangular items arranged neatly: 1) an image with an embroidered dress (located at the top left), 2) an image of a silver leaf hairpin (top right), 3) a piece showcasing bamboo embroidery (bottom right), and 4) what seems to be a shiny, silver object that resembles a book cover with various embroidery designs (bottom left). Since there are four items in total, the answer is not exactly three postcards.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bottom left item appears to be a silk-bound book cover with embroidered patterns. However, the set of items, including the postcards, is not presented within this book; rather, it appears as a separate item alongside the postcards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floral and scroll motifs on the garment exhibit stylized paper-cut effects such as sharp edges, layered appearance, and high contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "explanation": "The motifs on the embroidered dress feature intricate designs with smooth flowing lines and a seamless integrated appearance, typical of thread embroidery, rather than the characteristics of paper-cut art. This suggests that they do not possess sharp edges or a layered, high-contrast look typical of paper-cut effects.",
