      "question": "Has the image been transformed into a vintage detective movie poster style with a cinematic and dramatic presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presentation includes serious and dark elements, such as a grainy texture, angular shapes, and muted coloring typical of vintage movie posters. A significant focus on stylistic elements like the classic serif font and strong imagery (cityscape silhouette, magnifying glass) suggests a detective or noir genre. Therefore, the image transformation aligns with the aesthetic of a vintage detective movie poster.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
