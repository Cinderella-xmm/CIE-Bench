    "Question": "Q1: Has the yellow tennis ball been replaced with a flying disc?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a round object near the dog that appears to be a flying disc, commonly known as a frisbee, based on its flat and circular shape. This differs from Image A, where the object is a spherical yellow tennis ball. The disc in Image B replaces the tennis ball seen in Image A, indicating they are not the same.
