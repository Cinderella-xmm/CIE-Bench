      "question": "Are there visible flames gently flickering from the wingtips and tail of the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues show the bird's tail and wings with bright, fiery colors suggesting fire. The typical depiction of flames is characterized by flickering and varied layers of orange, red, and yellow, as seen here. The edges of the wings and tail appear to have a transparent, flame-like structure which aligns with the appearance of gently flickering flames.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the bird's plumage been replaced with iridescent, shimmering scales instead of solid red feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's surface appears textured and reflective, resembling scales more than feathers. Iridescence comes from light reflecting off multiple surfaces, creating a shimmering effect, which is visually represented in the edited image by a multi-colored surface instead of a uniformly red one seen typically on birds like the original cardinal in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there distinct fiery patterns (such as flame-like designs or glowing lines) visible across the bird's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible patterns that resemble swirling flames or glowing lines on the bird's body. These patterns are typically associated with depictions of fire, showing fluctuations in coloration and intensity along the bird's form, indicating designed fiery motifs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bird's eyes appear as glowing embers with a warm, luminous glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the bird have a bright, intense glow reminiscent of hot embers, characterized by the concentrated light and warm colors that suggest inner illumination. These visual elements make the eyes appear as though they are emitting light, akin to glowing embers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the branch now made of twisted, dark, glossy obsidian material instead of natural wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch has a shiny, dark appearance, with a texture indicating polished stone, such as obsidian. This is opposed to the traditional rough texture of natural wood seen in Image A, suggesting a more mystical or non-biological material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the blossoms on the branch depicted as burning or emitting flames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blossoms in Image B show elements indicative of burning, with parts of the flowers engulfed in visually distinct flames. This suggests that instead of natural growth, the flowers now have fiery exteriors, confirming the depiction of burning blossoms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the burning elements (flames, glowing parts) clearly visible in contrast to the falling snowflakes in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the burning elements such as flames and glowing parts are depicted with vibrant colors and intensity that starkly contrast the soft and muted whites of the falling snowflakes. This contrast is particularly evident because bright, fiery colors naturally stand out against pale backgrounds like snow.",
