    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cake feature bold, graphic icing patterns such as geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs instead of realistic frosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake displays graphic patterns made up of repetitive motifs and bright colors, characteristic of a pop art style. These patterns replace the realistic look of frosting with cartoonish designs, which are not present on the visually realistic cake in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloons composed of vivid monochrome dots rather than solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are decorated with monochrome dots, contrasting with the solid colors of the balloons in Image A. This dotted pattern aligns with the pop art style, which uses dots and lines to create texture and visual interest rather than relying on shading or gradients.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the table rendered as a flat, solid color block without texture or gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop is depicted as a flat, solid block of yellow color without any texture or gradient, which is a hallmark of the pop art style. This contrasts with the more textured and natural wood appearance seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase depicted as a solid color block without visible texture or design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is shown as a simple blue color block with no visible texture or detailed design, typical of a pop art representation that favors flat and defined colors. Image A, on the other hand, shows a vase with realistic texture and patterns.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the candle flame have exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candle flame in Image B is illustrated with sharp, bold outlines and vibrant colors, which differ from the natural and delicate flame in Image A. This effect is intentional in pop art to create a dramatic and stylized visual.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit characteristics of pop art, including flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays all the classic characteristics of pop art: flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms replace realistic textures and gradients seen in Image A. These artistic choices create a vibrant, attention-grabbing image typical of the pop art style.",
