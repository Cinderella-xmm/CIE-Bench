      "question": "Is the ceiling fan enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a fan is visible inside a transparent snow globe, resting on a tabletop. The fan inside the snow globe has a small size and cartoonish appearance, unlike a typical ceiling fan. Image A shows a ceiling fan, which hangs from the ceiling and is not enclosed within a snow globe. Comparing the two, Image B features a small, stylized fan inside a globe, rather than a ceiling fan. Thus, the description in question correctly applies to Image B.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest atop a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe with a fan inside, sitting on a tabletop. The lighting is soft, casting gentle reflections. The background is warm and minimalist, with soft tones and simple furnishings, suggesting a cozy and uncluttered space. There is no visible clutter or complex details in the environment, reinforcing the minimalist appearance. Image A, in contrast, simply shows a ceiling with a fan against a plain background, without a tabletop or any specific lighting arrangement. Therefore, the description in the question is consistent with Image B.",

      "question": "Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, you can observe shimmering effects on the tabletop surface near the snow globe, likely caused by light refracting through the transparent globe. The snow globe's structure helps cast these gentle and delicate reflections or light patterns onto the surrounding surfaces. Image A does not depict any such effects, as it only shows a ceiling fan mounted on a ceiling without a transparent surface to refract light. Thus, Image B matches the description given in the question.",

      "question": "Is the fan inside the snow globe depicted in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan inside the snow globe in Image B is presented in a cartoonish, stylized manner with exaggerated features, such as a smiling face, rounded shapes, and soft colors, making it appear playful and designed for a whimsical effect. This 3D design contrasts with the realistic depiction of the ceiling fan in Image A, which has a standard, metallic appearance typical of functional appliances, without any playful characteristics. Hence, the description in the question accurately pertains to Image B.",

      "question": "Are snowflakes visible drifting gently through the air inside the tiny room within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible white shapes resembling snowflakes floating within the globe's airspace, contributing to the snow globe's wintery, magical theme. These elements represent snowflakes commonly associated with snow globes, enhancing the scene's aesthetic. Image A, on the other hand, does not depict any such snowy elements and only features a ceiling fan on a neutral background. Thus, the description of snowflakes applies specifically to Image B.",
