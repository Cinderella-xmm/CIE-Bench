      "question": "Are the two players depicted in a chibi art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows two characters with exaggeratedly large heads and small bodies, which are typical characteristics of the chibi art style. This style often portrays characters in a cute, cartoon-like manner, which is evident in the image with the rounded and simplified features of the two characters. Based on these visual cues and world knowledge of chibi art, it's clear they are depicted in this style.",

      "question": "Do the players retain their original outfits and hairstyles after being chibi-fied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the characters are wearing white tennis outfits, which resemble typical tennis apparel, and have simplistic hair designs characteristic of a chibi representation. Given the chibi style often simplifies complex designs, without being able to compare them directly with Image A, it's reasonable to say they retain the essence of sportswear in this transformation, but specific outfit and hairstyle details may differ due to the stylistic change.",

      "question": "Are both players holding tennis rackets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are clearly depicted holding tennis rackets in their hands. The rackets are drawn with a characteristic oval shape with strings, which is a standard representation of a tennis racket, confirming they are indeed holding tennis rackets.",

      "question": "Are the two players shaking hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the two characters with their arms extended towards each other and their hands joined, which is commonly interpreted as a handshake. This position strongly suggests they are indeed shaking hands.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a semi-transparent court logo visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes lines and shapes that resemble elements of a tennis court, such as the net and baseline, but they are faint and blend into the background. This appearance can be described as semi-transparent. Therefore, there is a semi-transparent court logo in the background.",

      "question": "Has the edited image been output as a sticker image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a white border around the characters, which is typical of sticker designs to highlight and separate the figures from the background surface when adhered. This design choice, along with the simplified and polished illustration style, suggests that the image is intended to be used as a sticker.",
