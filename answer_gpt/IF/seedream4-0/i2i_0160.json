      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is clearly a starry night sky with visible stars, suggesting a night-time setting. This is a stark contrast to the typical colors and lighting of a sunset, which features warm and vibrant hues from the setting sun. As Image A shows a bright, warm background typical of a sunset, the background in Image B has indeed been changed from a sunset to a starry night sky.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible crescent moon in the background, which is consistent with the presence of a new moon. This indicates the depiction of a nighttime sky with celestial bodies such as the moon.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears soft and there are stars creating a serene and otherworldly atmosphere. However, there are no visible faint clouds or other specific dreamy effects beyond the changed lighting conducive to a night setting. The dreaminess is primarily derived from the celestial elements and the shift to a night sky.",
