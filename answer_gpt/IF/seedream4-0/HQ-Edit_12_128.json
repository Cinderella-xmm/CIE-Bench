      "question": "Is the clock's frame made of translucent crystal instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock's frame appears to be made of a clear, shiny material that reflects and refracts light, which is characteristic of crystal. This is in contrast to the more opaque and textured appearance of wood. The visual cues, such as the transparency and reflective quality of the material, combined with common knowledge of the properties of crystal and wood, suggest that the frame in Image B is made of a translucent crystal. Comparing with Image A, where the frame is clearly wooden, reinforces this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ornamental details and frame of the clock crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details and frame of the clock have a frosted, glass-like appearance, indicating they are made from a material akin to crystal. This gives off a shiny, somewhat frosted appearance that is not typical of wood, which would have a more consistent texture and less gloss. Given these observations and comparing to Image A with its carved wood details, it is reasonable to conclude that in Image B, the details are crafted from frosted crystal.",

      "question": "Is the clock face made of smooth, clear crystal with etched Roman numerals instead of a wooden face with painted numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face appears smooth, with a clear, see-through characteristic typical of crystal. The numerals are etched or embedded rather than painted, offering a different texture than wood. Common knowledge suggests that wood would display painted numerals rather than etched, bolstering the case for crystal. Image A shows a wooden face with painted numerals, emphasizing the distinction.",

      "question": "Has the pendulum been replaced with a faceted crystal ornament instead of a solid wooden disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the pendulum appears to be a faceted crystal, reflecting light and exhibiting multiple facets, typical of crystal ornaments. This differs from Image A where the pendulum is a solid wooden disk, which would have a more uniform texture and do not refactor light this way. The sparkling, diamond-like appearance in Image B supports the conclusion that the pendulum has been replaced with a crystal ornament.",

      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a minimalist white marble wall with visible natural veining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a minimalist wall with a smooth white surface, featuring subtle gray lines that are characteristic of natural veining in marble. This texture and coloration are indicative of white marble. Comparing with Image A, where the wall has a different color and texture, supports the notion that in Image B, the clock is indeed mounted on a white marble wall.",
