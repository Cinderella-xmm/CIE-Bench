      "question": "Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle appears to be constructed entirely from LEGO bricks. This can be deduced from the uniform studded texture characteristic of LEGO pieces and the absence of any visible glass or plastic materials. Each surface of the bottle, including the cap, body, and label, displays a pattern and texture consistent with LEGO construction, signifying a complete LEGO design with no realistic glass or plastic components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottle's body and sides in a color resembling green, and the pieces appear to be translucent, which is a characteristic of some LEGO bricks. The translucency provides a sense of depth and mimics the appearance of a real glass bottle to a certain extent, but the conspicuous LEGO studs confirm their construction. This indicates that the bottle's body and sides are indeed made of translucent green LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the label area composed of multicolored LEGO blocks representing the original design elements (logo, text, colors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label area is made up of LEGO bricks of various colors that replicate elements of the original design. The use of different colored bricks to create the label visually mimics the logo, text, and colors found on a bottle's original label, albeit in the blocky, pixelated style resultant from using LEGO bricks. This includes the brand logo and text like 'Bacardi' and 'Mojito,' suggesting the label area is indeed composed of multicolored LEGO blocks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cap made from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks and does it maintain a cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B is constructed of blue LEGO bricks that stack to form a cylindrical shape. The familiar, smooth, circular appearance of LEGO bricks designed for such purposes gives the cap this rounded structure. The visible studs imply that while it's designed to retain the shape of a bottle cap, it's made of blue LEGO pieces arranged to appear cylindrical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral or white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle rests on a simple white shelf with no additional decorative elements present. The background behind the shelf appears to be neutral or white, creating a minimalist setting that doesn't distract from the LEGO bottle itself. This setup emphasizes the LEGO sculpture in its environment, consistent with the minimalist description.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all brand texts (e.g., \"Bacardi,\" \"Mojito,\" \"Classic Cocktails\") visibly rendered in blocky LEGO-style lettering and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key texts like 'Bacardi,' 'Mojito,' and 'Classic Cocktails' are represented using LEGO bricks but they do not appear to retain legibility typical to small text rendered this way. The approximations of letters using LEGO blocks create a blocky style that might hint at the brand and drink names, but the standard LEGO brick size limitations could make them less clearly legible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bottle display clear sculptural features such as defined edges, depth, and 3D form to emphasize its construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the LEGO bottle clearly showcases its construction through visible layers of bricks that add depth and texture. The defined edges, the varying heights of stacked bricks, and the overall three-dimensional form highlight the sculptural quality of the design typical of LEGO creations. These features emphasize the craft involved in building the bottle with LEGO bricks, resulting in a three-dimensional object.",
