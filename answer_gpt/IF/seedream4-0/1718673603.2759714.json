      "question": "Are all structural elements of the Japanese house rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black lead lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited version, the Japanese house is depicted with a stained glass effect. The structural elements such as walls, windows, and roof are illustrated using different colored glass panels, which are bound by black lines that resemble the lead cames used in traditional stained glass art. This method creates the appearance of separated glass pieces, which is characteristic of stained glass designs. This artistic style provides a unique, vibrant, and colored form to the house, ensuring each section appears as if made from individual glass segments.",

      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized floral motifs made of red and green segmented glass pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, while the red trees from Image A have been stylized, they have not been transformed into floral motifs. Instead, they still maintain the shape of trees, constructed from segmented glass pieces of red color, with additional segments in other areas using green and other colors, mimicking the stained glass effect. Thus, the trees maintain their form as trees rather than being replaced by other motifs.",

      "question": "Is the large red moon rendered using multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the large red moon using concentric circles that use varying shades of red, which is a stylistic approach often found in stained glass that incorporates different tones to suggest depth and texture. Instead of being a solid red, these circles create a complex pattern that adds visual interest and aligns with the stained glass aesthetic employed in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all major elements (house, trees, moon) clearly outlined with thick, black, continuous lines resembling lead came in stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the major elements such as the house, trees, and the moon are surrounded by thick, black lines that are continuous, akin to the lead came used to join pieces of stained glass. This stylistic choice defines each shape, emphasizing the boundaries between different colored panels and adhering to the traditional stained glass design principles by using these heavy outlines to compartmentalize the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene maintain the original composition (house centered, trees flanking, moon above, water in foreground) while all elements are styled as stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and the edited Image B have the same core composition: the house is centrally positioned, the trees flanking it on both sides, the prominent moon in the top section, and the water in the foreground reflecting these elements. Edited Image B, while transformed into a stained glass style, preserves this layout, ensuring the scene's structural composition remains consistent with the original image.",
