      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's body is visually distinct with a detailed crystal-like appearance. The material appears to be reflective and has a greenish tint reminiscent of colors found in emerald and jade. The use of facets and reflective surfaces throughout the truck suggests a stylization that mimics gemstones. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge of how gemstones like emerald and jade are cut and polished to enhance their reflective qualities, support the conclusion that the truck is designed to appear as though made of layered, reflective crystals. Therefore, the answer is based on these observations.",

      "question": "Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels appear transparent, lacking any color, and display internal patterns that suggest a crystalline structure. The appearance of transparency and the intricate patterns align with common characteristics of quartz, which is known for its clarity and internal crystalline formations. These visual indicators match the description of quartz wheels, supporting the notion that the wheels are designed to appear as though they are made of quartz with visible patterns.",

      "question": "Is the truck placed on a smooth, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base upon which the truck in Image B rests appears white with a smooth texture and subtle gray veining, characteristic of marble. Given the context and common knowledge of marbleâ€™s appearance and use in displays, the visual evidence corresponds to a marble platform. This inference is drawn from the familiar traits of polished white marble, known for being used in high-end display settings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the truck, particularly on the cabin and body, display a series of angular, faceted planes that mirror the traits of well-cut crystal. These facets create multiple reflections and refractions of light, which are characteristic of crystal surfaces designed to maximize optical play. This is a standard feature in cut gemstones and similar materials, suggesting that these design features were deliberately used to achieve such an effect.",

      "question": "Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing the structural setup of the truck in Image A and Image B, both trucks share the same overall proportions and layout with minimal variance. The position and arrangement of components such as the cab, cargo area, and wheels are consistent between both images. While Image B transforms the material to a crystal-like appearance, it retains the architecture and proportion of the original military truck, suggesting careful adherence to the original structure.",
