      "question": "Has the Tudor-style gown been replaced with a draped Ancient Greek-style garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a woman wearing a garment that has characteristics resembling Ancient Greek clothing: a draped style with distinct geometric borders. This contrasts with the heavily adorned Tudor-style attire in Image A, which featured elaborate patterns and a high collar. The transition from a structured, layered Tudor gown to a simpler, draped Ancient Greek style is evident.",
