      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is shown with large, expressive eyes which are common features in cartoon or chibi characters to emphasize emotions and cuteness.

      "question": "Are the stickers designed with a dimension ratio of 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To analyze the dimension ratio of 9:16, one has to evaluate the general layout and sizing of stickers in Image B. The overall display doesnâ€™t adhere to a vertical ratio like 9:16. Instead, it's arranged in a 2x3 grid manner indicating shorter width relative to height. The orientation does not reflect typical portrait sizes found in dimensions like 9:16.",
