      "question": "Have the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos been transformed into stylized, gleaming golden award statuettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Search for a Star' logo is no longer visible, and the 'Rising Star' logo remains a 2D graphic design positioned atop a wooden base rather than being transformed into a golden statuette. The actual golden statuette present in Image B is a separate object, resembling famous award figures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been changed to a rich, dark velvet curtain, replacing the original green background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is clearly a dark velvet curtain, which contrasts starkly with the bright green background seen in Image A. This suggests a significant change in the backdrop from a simple colored backdrop to a more textured and formal setting in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 'Sumo Digital' logo rendered as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Sumo Digital' logo appears prominently on the wooden plaque under the 'Rising Star' logo, suggesting it has been integrated into the base rather than separately embossed. It is clearly not presented as an embossed seal alongside texture effects typical of such a design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text presented in elegant, engraved silver lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text is presented in a rendered 3D-looking silver text with highlights and shadows that simulate engraved metal, reflecting a more formal and prestigious appearance compared to the flat white text in Image A.",

      "question": "Has the structural integrity of the original image been maintained while applying the specified changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transition from Image A to Image B, various design elements have been altered (e.g., text styling, background and presentation). However, despite these changes, core structural elements like the presence of the 'Rising Star' logo and text have been maintained. The changes have altered the aesthetic significantly rather than altering the entire content structure, ensuring some degree of structural integrity.",
