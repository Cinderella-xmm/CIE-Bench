      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church features bold and clear outlines with flat coloring, typical of cartoon or semi-cartoon styles.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the church maintains its original proportion similar to Image A, but cartoon stylization typically emphasizes certain features. However, without direct evidence of alteration in size or proportion beyond the stylization itself, the church's grandeur and scale do not seem overly exaggerated.",
