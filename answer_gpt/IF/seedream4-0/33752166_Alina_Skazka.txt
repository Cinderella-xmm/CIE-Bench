    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image show the building transformed into a giant mechanical golem with visible articulated limbs and exposed gears?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has clearly been transformed into a robotic form. The building now features articulated limbs that resemble arms and legs, along with visible gears and mechanical components. This transformation resembles a mechanical golem. The visual cues, such as the presence of gears and robotic limbs, indicate a deliberate alteration from a static building to a dynamic robot form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are all original windows replaced with glowing energy panels that emit light?",
    "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows sections of the building with windows that emit bright light, which resembles panels or energy sources rather than traditional windows. This indicates a transformation where many windows have been replaced with panels that give off light, suggesting energy emission.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the balconies been transformed into arm-like mechanical appendages extending from the building?",
    "explanation": "Image B does indeed include balcony structures that now extend as mechanical appendages and contribute to the overall robotic form. These appear to be integral parts of the arms of the mechanical golem, differing significantly from traditional balconies of a building.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there visible intricate circuit patterns covering the surface of the building, resembling electronic wiring or circuits?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates intricate patterns on the surface of the building that resemble circuits and electronic wiring. These decorative elements signify the transformation of the building into a mechanical entity with technological features visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the building's angular edges appear as dynamic or movable mechanical components, such as hinges, pistons, or rotating joints?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the angular edges of the building have been modified to resemble movable mechanical components. These parts are indicative of hinges, pistons, or rotating joints, which are features commonly associated with mechanical constructs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the background still a clear blue sky without any changes or additions?",
    "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the background remains unchanged, featuring a clear blue sky. The transformation focuses on the building itself, leaving the background intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Has the building’s overall size and position within the frame remained consistent with the original image?",
    "explanation": "Upon comparing Image A and Image B, the building’s size and position within the frame remain consistent. Even though its design and features have been modified, its scale and location relative to the frame boundaries do not appear to have shifted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
