        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit is definitely not the traditional monochrome or dark-colored suit typically associated with formal wear. Instead, it is covered with a vibrant, floral pattern featuring colorful flowers, which indicates a more artistic and informal style. This significant change from a typical formal suit is very noticeable and aligns with a change to a floral-patterned design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow tie is characterized by a design that includes bold, striking colors and distinct geometric patterns, differing from the usual single-color or subtly patterned bow tie seen in formal wear.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B showcases a pattern that consists of numerous small, evenly distributed dots, which is a distinct departure from a plain or uniform background.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays multiple pop art characteristics: the suit and bow tie have strong, bold outlines, the colors in these elements are flat and vivid, and there is a high contrast between the colorful attire and the neutral background. These features are typical of pop art, which often emphasizes visual impact and vibrant colors.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the facial features are blurred and thus not assessable in both images, the posture, as discernible from the neck and shoulders in Image B, appears unchanged compared to the typical portrait posture found in formal photography, suggesting that the posture remains the same.",
