        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows only three distinct elements: a girl, a stone platform she is standing on, and a frisbee she is holding. The background is a minimalistic wide expanse of grass and blue sky, which does not add any distractions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the golden ratio is a specific guideline for compositional balance, Image B appears to be well-balanced with the girl centrally positioned, using empty space effectively. However, without exact measurement and more positioning criteria, claiming adherence to the golden ratio is speculative.",
