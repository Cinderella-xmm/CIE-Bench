    "Question": "Q2: Does the right-side skier cast a shadow that suggests depth and closeness to the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow of the right-side skier is noticeable and extends downward and slightly behind them, giving the impression of depth. The shadow is large and prominent, which typically indicates that the object casting it is relatively close to the viewer and the surface it casts upon, suggesting depth and proximity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the right-side skier appear crisp and clear, without evident motion lines or blurring effects. This indicates that no additional effects have been applied to simulate motion or speed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier is positioned closer to the foreground compared to other elements, including the left-side skier and the background. This repositioning makes them visually prominent, standing out more in terms of size and proximity to the viewer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the posture and angle of the right-side skier are such that they appear to be leaning forward into the direction of the slope. This positioning simulates dynamic movement toward the viewer, enhancing the sense of action and immediacy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
