        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiles forming the sausage are larger and more elongated compared to the smaller, more angular tiles used for the lettuce. This size difference is observable and supported by the differing shapes needed for each item depiction.",
