      "question": "Does the cocktail glass appear to be sculpted from clay with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass seems to be made from clay, exhibiting a rough and textured surface characteristic of clay sculptures. Typically, clay sculpted objects have noticeable textures and imperfections due to the handcrafting process. The visual cues such as the unevenness and texture on the glass support this assessment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ice cubes and lime slice depicted with intricate clay textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes and lime slice are depicted with a similar clay texture as the glass, which suggests they were also sculpted from clay. The ice cubes look blocky and uneven, which aligns with the hand-sculpted clay appearance. The lime slice, while colored, also lacks the realism of a freshly cut fruit and instead shows the texture indicative of a clay rendition.",

      "question": "Do the surroundings, including the bar and bottles, exhibit a handcrafted clay appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire environment, including the bar and bottles, seems to be crafted from clay. This is evident from the textured and uniform clay appearance across all objects in the scene, such as the matte finish and lack of sharp details typical of handcrafted clay models.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition maintain an organic, imperfect look characteristic of hand-sculpted clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirety of Image B reflects an organic and imperfect look, synonymous with hand-sculpted clay. This is reinforced by the visible texture and non-uniform structures visible throughout the image, including the main subject and background objects, which suggest handcrafted clay modeling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting and shading adjusted to enhance the clay-like textures and three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shading in Image B are tailored to accentuate the clay texture and three-dimensional form of the objects. The light source creates shadows consistent with the uneven surfaces and adds depth often seen in clay sculptures. This lighting effectively highlights the textures and imperfections of the clay surfaces.",
