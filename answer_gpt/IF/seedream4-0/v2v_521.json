      "question": "Does the image feature a stylized illustration of iconic kitchen items like a cream-hued stove, a retro fridge, and wooden utensils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects depicted include a stove, fridge, and utensils that have a stylized and almost cartoonish illustration style. The stove and fridge both have a distinctive vintage or retro look, characterized by their simple yet exaggerated shapes and colors. The utensils are similarly stylized, primarily depicted in what appears to be a classic, simplified form alone, making them easily recognizable to the viewer. These visual cues combined with general knowledge about vintage appliances and kitchen setups firmly suggest that these items are iconic and meant to evoke nostalgia.",

      "question": "Does the card have a slightly worn paper texture and rounded edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the card features subtle visual details that suggest a worn paper texture. The background appears to have small scratches or discolorations reminiscent of aged paper. Moreover, the edges are visibly rounded, differing from the typical straight edges of most modern cards, suggesting an intentional design choice to replicate a vintage, well-used appearance.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the image muted and earthy, primarily consisting of beige, soft green, and brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is characterized by its muted, earthy tones. The main colors visible are various shades of beige, which dominate the background and many elements, some soft greens visible on the fridge, and brown tones seen throughout, including the text and shadowing. These color choices allude to a vintage aesthetic, often reliant on subdued and natural color schemes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible details along the edges and surface of the card that resemble distress markings, which mimic wear and tear over time as seen with old paper. These include visual anomalies such as scuffs, which contribute to the aged look. Additionally, there are gentle shadows present along the borders, enhancing the perception of texture and depth, further supporting the vintage appearance.",
