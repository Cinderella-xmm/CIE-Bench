      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two towers of the castle now depicted as thick, upright tree trunks with visible, textured bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the prominent objects are two large tree trunks, indicating a transformation from stone towers to natural tree forms. The trunks have textured bark, a common characteristic of mature trees, contrasting the man-made, smooth stone appearance of castle towers. This change suggests a shift to an organic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the stone walls between the towers been replaced with large, spreading branches that extend outward from the tree trunks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of the solid stone walls seen between towers, there is a central trunk with extensive branches spreading outwards, creating a seamless integration with the surrounding environment typical of tree branches. These branches provide a natural, expansive look unlike solid stone structures, suggesting a replacement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the flagpole and flag removed, and replaced with glowing, translucent green leaves that appear to float or flutter above the tree structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible flagpole or flag atop any structure. Instead, there are glowing, translucent green leaves that seem to float or flutter around the tree structure. These leaves replace the function and visual appearance of a flag by adding a mystical, ethereal quality to the image, contrasting the static and opaque nature of a flag.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ground-level plants and roots transformed into visible spirit-like figures, partially transparent and integrated into the root system?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground displays spirit-like figures that appear translucent and present a spectral appearance. These figures are integrated into the root system, suggesting a transformation from simple static plants to dynamic, mystical elements, contributing to the overall ambiance of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire structure now resemble a living, ancient tree sentinel with organic forms replacing all stone elements, and does the scene have a mystical, glowing ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a giant tree with dynamic branches and glowing green elements, replacing all former stone structures. The integration of tree roots and spirit-like figures enhances the mystical feel, creating an ancient sentinel-like presence that reflects life and magic, differing from the static stone castle scene.",
