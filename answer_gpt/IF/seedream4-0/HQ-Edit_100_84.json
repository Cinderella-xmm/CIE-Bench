        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails and the body of the dhow boat are covered with intricate designs that resemble traditional Middle Eastern decorations, including geometric and possibly arabesque patterns.

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there mythical sea creatures (e.g., mermaids, sea serpents, or winged fish) with delicate, detailed features visible around the dhow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two mythical sea creatures are added to the foreground, resembling sea serpents or dragons, which are depicted with an intricate level of detail and stylized features.

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are rich blue tones (in water and sky) and golden hues (in sails, light, and decorations) prominently used to create a strong visual contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clear emphasis on vibrant blue tones in the water and intricate gold patterns on the dhow's sails and decorations. The sky is rendered with warm golden hues, creating a visually striking contrast that enhances the image's mystic and exotic theme, which aligns with common artistic techniques for enhancing visual appeal. Image A has a more subdued color palette without these contrasting tones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the distant sailboats in the background rendered as simple, dark silhouettes without visible sails or structural detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant sailboats appear as dark, simplistic silhouettes set against the bright, glowing background. They lack detailed sails or structural features, which helps maintain focus on the main dhow and adds depth to the scene by contrast. Image A shows similar silhouettes but without the enhanced lighting effects present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the horizon on the right, there is a faint mirage of a structure that resembles an Arabian architectural style, with dome features and geometric patterns. This mirage adds to the mystical quality of the scene and is not evident in Image A, indicating it's a stylistic addition in Image B.",
