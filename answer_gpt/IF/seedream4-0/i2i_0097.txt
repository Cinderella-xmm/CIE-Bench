    "Question": "Q1: Has the image been redesigned into a poster format?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue of a large, prominent text at the top of the image, combined with elements like the plate and spoon, resembles a typical poster presentation. A poster often contains a main visual element and accompanying text that delivers a particular message or theme. The addition of text in Image B suggests a transformation from a simple image to a more informational format, thus aligning with a poster style.",
