      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head is positioned within the frame and does not extend beyond the edges. This conclusion is reached by observing the visual alignment of the cat's head in relation to the boundaries of the image frame. There are no portions of the head or surrounding area that cross over or appear cropped by the frame's edges.",

      "question": "Does the curled tongue show clear spatial depth, giving a 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat's tongue curled in a manner that reveals its thickness and contours, providing a sense of depth. This can be analyzed by looking at the curvature and shading on the tongue, which give it a three-dimensional appearance. The three-dimensionality is further supported by the naturalistic lighting and shadows that highlight the tongue’s form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the position and angle of the cat’s head create a visual illusion of peeking out from the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position and angle of the cat’s head are such that it appears to be comfortably lying on a surface, but there is no impression that it's peeking out of the frame. The head is entirely within the frame with no indication of an extended view or overlapping edges that might create such a visual illusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a natural appearance for the cat, aside from the instructed modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a natural appearance for the cat; the lighting, fur texture, and shading are consistent with a realistic portrayal. The only prominent modification is the tongue's position, which, although notable, does not detract from the otherwise natural look of the cat. The environment and pose appear realistic and coherent.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edits seamlessly integrated with the rest of the image, with no noticeable artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of the tongue and other elements does not exhibit noticeable artifacts or glitches that would indicate artificial manipulation. The lighting, texture, and overall composition are continuous and harmonious, suggesting that any edits performed were done smoothly and with attention to detail to maintain the visual integrity of the image.",
