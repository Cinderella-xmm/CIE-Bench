      "question": "Is the woman depicted in a stylized cartoon form with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is portrayed with smooth lines, flat colors, and stylized proportions, typical of cartoon or animated illustrations. This depiction contrasts with realistic portrayals, which usually have more detail and texture. Image A, for comparison, shows a woman in a realistic form with detailed textures and contours. Thus, Image B clearly represents a simplified and exaggerated form of the woman.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress visibly enlarged and accented with gold highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the dress are prominently illustrated with larger blooms and added gold accents, enhancing their visibility and ornamental appeal. In comparison, Image A features more nuanced floral patterns without the prominent gold highlights, appearing more subtle and intricate. The use of gold in Image B further exaggerates and stylizes the pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit radiant or luminous color tones, such as glowing or highly saturated hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the dress in bright, vivid colors with a luminous quality, typical of an animated or cartoon style. This contrasts with the more subtle and realistic tones in Image A, which lacks the glowing, saturated effect found in Image B. The cartoon style often favors these radiant qualities to create visual impact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are abstract, non-realistic bamboo shadows present in the image to enhance depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates stylized bamboo shadows that appear abstract and exaggerated, contributing to a sense of depth and dimensionality within the illustration. Image A, in contrast, contains realistic shadows consistent with photography, while Image B uses illustrative techniques to create a sense of movement and space.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a blank, bamboo-shaped writing panel framed by soft watercolor bamboo motifs in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly defined blank panel at the top, designed in a bamboo shape, framed by delicate watercolor motifs. This contrasts with Image A, which does not have such a panel. The inclusion of watercolor designs in Image B adds artistic flair and context for text or additional decoration.",
