      "question": "Is the cityscape and car fully enclosed within a transparent, cube-shaped resin casing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a transparent cube with a cityscape and a car inside, which closely resembles a resin casing. The fact that the surroundings are clearly visible and encased within the cube leads to the conclusion that the cityscape and car are indeed fully enclosed within a transparent casing, aligning with the description of a resin.",

      "question": "Does the car feature a sleek, futuristic design with metallic and highly reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car features a modern, streamlined shape with smooth curves and a metallic finish that reflects the light. These aspects are characteristic of a sleek, futuristic design, supporting the conclusion that the car has such a design with reflective surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers visibly reduced in size compared to the original image, enhancing the sense of depth and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image A reveals normal-sized skyscrapers relative to typical city settings. In Image B, the skyscrapers are enclosed in a miniature setting, markedly smaller than their natural representation, contributing to depth and scale perception. The comparison indicates that they are indeed reduced in size.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the skyscrapers have small, distinct points of light resembling micro LEDs on their windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers' windows display tiny, bright points, resembling LEDs or lit windows, suggesting illumination typical of night scenes or detailed miniatures, which confirms the presence of such lights.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, miniature foliage with rich green coloration that contrasts with the surrounding urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees exhibit detailed, small-scale foliage with vibrant green coloring, providing a contrast to the urban buildings. This depiction of the trees as miniatures enhances the contrast between greenery and city infrastructure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the resin cube completely transparent with no visible color distortion or opacity, allowing full view of the interior scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the cube in Image B shows a clear view of the cityscape and the car inside it. The cube's transparency is evident as there are no visible distortions or opaque sections, allowing an unobstructed view of the encased scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in the same relative location on the street as in the original image, maintaining its orientation and alignment with the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the car in Image B is positioned on a miniaturized road within the resin cube, distinctly different from its road position in Image A. Despite sharing a similar orientation, the change in setting indicates a different relative location, leading to the conclusion that the position differs.",
