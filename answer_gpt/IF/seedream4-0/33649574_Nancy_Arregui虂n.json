      "question": "Has the rooster been transformed into a mythical phoenix-like creature with an otherworldly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has been visually altered to resemble a mythical being rather than a natural rooster. The notable features include a majestic shining plumage, ethereal appearance, and mythical elements such as fiery wings and glowing effects. This deviation from the natural rooster's form in Image A suggests a transformation into a phoenix-like entity, which is commonly associated with myths.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the feathers display iridescent, fiery colors with visible shimmering gradients that simulate heat or flame effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an enhanced and stylized depiction of the feathers with vibrant, fiery hues. The colors transition smoothly and are reminiscent of flames, creating a shimmering gradient effect. This striking visual is indicative of an otherworldly, flame-mimicking display, not typically observed in natural roosters as seen in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the rooster’s tail been replaced with long, flowing plumes that transition into wispy, smoke-like tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the creature appears extended and stylized with plumes that transform into smoke-like tendrils, imparting a mystical and fluid quality. This is a stark contrast to the solid, natural tail of the rooster in Image A, indicating a deliberate edit to evoke the image of an ethereal being.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there molten gold accents visibly applied along the edges of the wings and the head crest, resembling liquid metal or glowing gold?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show highlights and outlines along the wings and crest that reflect the appearance of molten gold or liquid metal. These accents provide a luminous, gilded effect that emphasizes the mythical aesthetic of the altered creature, compared to the plain features of the rooster in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the rooster's eyes been replaced or altered to look like flickering flames, with internal motion and glowing orange/yellow tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are noticeably different from those of a regular rooster. They emit a vibrant, fiery glow with an apparent texture that resembles flickering flames, enhancing the creature's supernatural theme. In contrast, Image A shows the ordinary eyes of a rooster without these enhanced features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible ancient rune-like patterns etched or drawn onto the rooster’s talons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays markings on the creature's talons that resemble ancient runes or symbols, which contribute to the mythical and mystical theme. These markings are absent in Image A, pointing to an intentional alteration to imbue the creature with an enigmatic quality.",
