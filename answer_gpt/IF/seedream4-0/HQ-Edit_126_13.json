        "Yes",
        "No"

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text accompanying the diagram in Image B appears to be in a script that resembles a handwritten style. The font looks informal and organic, akin to calligraphy, although it is not ornate or overly stylized. This style matches a handwritten look.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the annotations, lines, and icons in the diagram use a pastel green color. This hue is soft and pastel-like, which complements the neutral and serene color palette of the rest of the image, creating a harmonious visual effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image A and Image B, it is clear that the original objects such as the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with cherry blossoms, and patterned mats remain in their same positions and maintain their initial appearances. The modifications only involve overlaying graphical elements without altering these objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the added diagram avoid overlapping or obscuring any of the original table elements and instead flow naturally around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the annotated lines and icons of the diagram are placed in such a way that they wrap around the original elements without covering or overshadowing them. This indicates that the diagram elements are designed to integrate with the table setup without causing obstructions.",
