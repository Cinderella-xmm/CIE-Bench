        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is surrounded by paper elements like cutouts and a lantern, suggesting a theme of paper craft. The kite itself, with its simple geometric design and clearly defined edges, appears flat and rigid, resembling a paper craft model. This impression is enhanced by the consistent lighting and shadowing, which give it a paper-like quality often seen in paper crafts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the kite is central and prominent, there are several decorative elements around it, including paper cutouts and a red lantern.

      "question": "Are the structural details of the kite, such as its frame and tail, well-defined and clear enough to suggest it could be crafted from paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite's frame and tail are visibly outlined and appear to have a certain rigidity and simplicity that are characteristic of paper constructions. The smooth, consistent lines and edges, along with the simple color palette, contribute to the notion that this kite could be easily crafted from paper, as it lacks intricate details that are typically harder to replicate with paper.",
