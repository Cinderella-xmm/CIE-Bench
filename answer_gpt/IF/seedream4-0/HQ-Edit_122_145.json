      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the characters are depicted with disproportionately large heads and small bodies, which is characteristic of the chibi art style. This style is known for its cute, simplified representation of characters, often with exaggerated facial expressions.

      "question": "Are the floral patterns and bows on the kimono significantly more vibrant and exaggerated in color and size compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the floral patterns and bows appear to be vibrant and stylized with bold colors. In the context of chibi art, details are often exaggerated for visual impact. Image A presents a more realistic and intricate depiction, typical of a traditional kimono. The exaggerated, colorful, and simplified features in Image B suggest a stylized enhancement typical in chibi representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly four separate images of the chibi character, each in a unique pose corresponding to holding a cherry blossom branch, catching petals, gazing at blooming trees, and dancing amidst falling flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features four separate characters. One is holding a cherry blossom branch, another appears to be in an action associated with catching petals, a third holds hands out, and the last seems in a serene pose. These actions align with the description of unique poses. However, the specific pose described as 'gazing at blooming trees' isn't directly identified in the image.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the four images depict a clear and distinct action—holding a branch, catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing—with visible movement or interaction with cherry blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each character in Image B displays distinct poses: one is holding a cherry blossom branch, the second is reaching for petals, the third has a pose with arms open, and the fourth is in a relaxed pose, suggesting dancing or serene joy. The actions generally convey movement or interaction with cherry blossoms. However, none is overtly gazing at trees, which reduces clarity for the 'gazing at trees' action.",

      "question": "Are the four fridge magnets displayed together on a single pastel-colored surface that appears to be a magnetic sheet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the chibi figures as part of a set displayed on a single pastel-colored backing. This arrangement resembles how fridge magnets or decorative stickers are often presented for sale. The pastel background gives a cohesive visual appeal, appearing like a magnetic sheet or display card.",
