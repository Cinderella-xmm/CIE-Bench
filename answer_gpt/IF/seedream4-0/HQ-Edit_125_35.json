      "question": "Is the saxophone transformed into a serpent-like creature with a coiled body and metallic scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the object clearly depicts a serpent-like creature that features a coiled body with distinctly metallic scales. This appearance is synonymous with a transformation from a saxophone structure to a serpent. The body shape and scale texture suggest a serpent and not a musical instrument. Based on the visual cues, it is clear that the saxophone-like object has transformed into a serpent-like creature.",

      "question": "Are the original saxophone keys replaced with gemstones that exhibit a shimmering, reflective quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are no visible saxophone keys that are associated with the musical instrument's mechanics. Instead, the image showcases gemstones set into the serpent's scales that appear shiny and reflective, consistent with jewelry rather than instrument keys. Hence, based on the visual observation and comparison to typical saxophone keys, it suggests that any such elements have been replaced or omitted in favor of gemstones.",

      "question": "Has the bell of the saxophone been transformed into an open maw featuring sharp, stylized fangs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the central feature is a serpent with an open mouth that includes sharp, stylized fangs. The transformation from a saxophone's bell to a serpentine maw is clear through the visual substitution of traditional saxophone parts with serpent anatomy. This indicates a complete change from a musical instrument bell to a serpent's open mouth.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the saxophone’s neck extend into a coiled serpent body decorated with delicate filigree patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the originally saxophone's neck features are no longer evident. Instead, there is a serpent's body that is curved and coiled, with intricate filigree patterns embellishing the scales. This transformation arms the serpent with artistic and decorative elements practical for jewelry, thus creating an aesthetic change from the original saxophone neck.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the reed been transformed into a barbed tongue extending from the serpent’s maw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the serpent in Image B features a barbed tongue emanating from its open mouth, resembling the aggressive adaptation found in predatory animals rather than a traditional saxophone reed. The visual portrayal is suggestive of a tongue, not aligned with any part of a saxophone reed which lacks these features.",

      "question": "Is the saxophone/serpent resting on a red velvet cushion identical in appearance to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the original and the edited images depict the central object (saxophone and serpent, respectively) resting on a plush red velvet cushion. The appearance of this cushion, including its texture, color, and position in the scene, remains consistent between the original and edited images, indicating no change.",

      "question": "Is the lighting still focused on the central subject, producing a spotlight effect similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B continues to focus directly onto the central subject, generating a spotlight effect that draws attention to the serpent, similarly to how the focus was directed towards the saxophone in the original image (Image A). This consistency of lighting technique highlights the central subject similarly in both images.",
