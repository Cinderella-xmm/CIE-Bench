    "Question": "Q1: Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the timer on the left parking meter is still present in its expected location, which is the half-circular gauge at the top part of the meter. However, an additional element, a robotic dog, has been added to the front of the parking meter, near the coin slot. This does not replace the timer but is an addition to the parking meter structure.",
    "answer": "No"
