      "question": "Is the facade of the theater building constructed from visible tan LEGO bricks with brown accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the theater building is depicted using LEGO bricks. The entire structure, including distinctive elements like horizontal lines or designs, appears to be made up of tan LEGO bricks with darker brown bricks utilized for the accents and decorative features. By applying common knowledge of LEGO sets and the visual features of the edited image, it's evident that LEGO bricks have been used to emulate the original building structure with tan and brown coloration.",

      "question": "Are the large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO pieces arranged in a grid pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large arched windows are depicted as being made of translucent LEGO pieces that are arranged in a pattern resembling a grid. This can be discerned by observing the texture and arrangement of the LEGO pieces which mimic the transparency and grid-like design of typical arched windows. This observation suggests a creative use of LEGO pieces to recreate the look of the original arched windows.",

      "question": "Are the marquee signs for \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" rendered using smooth red flat LEGO bricks to form the letters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marquee signs for 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' are represented with red LEGO bricks. However, the letters for these signs appear to be printed or designed on the bricks rather than constructed using flat LEGO bricks specifically to form letters. Thus, the signage resembles LEGO components but doesn't use smooth LEGO bricks to create each letter individually, but rather displays printed or etched lettering on red LEGO elements.",

      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles, one in black and one in purple, with angular, modular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both vintage cars are shown as LEGO-style vehicles, characterized by the recognizable blocky design inherent to LEGO construction. The colors match as one car is black and the other purple, and their shapes consist of angular and modular features typical of LEGO models. This aligns with common LEGO techniques of building vehicles, replicating vintage cars in a simplified, toy-like manner.",

      "question": "Does the entire scene—including the building, cars, and signage—appear as a cohesive, playful, miniature LEGO model with consistent blocky textures and toy-like proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirety of Image B illustrates a scene crafted to resemble a LEGO model. The building, cars, and other elements are all constructed from LEGO bricks, showcasing blocky textures and toy-like proportions, which are hallmarks of LEGO models. This consistent use of LEGO components throughout the scene ensures it appears cohesive and playful, akin to a miniature LEGO creation.",
