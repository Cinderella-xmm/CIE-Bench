      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is characterized by bold outlines, vibrant colors, and a painterly texture, indicating a cartoon-like representation. The brushstrokes and color palette contribute to a stylized depiction, which is typical of a thick-painted cartoon style. This approach simplifies forms and accentuates features in a way that aligns with cartoon aesthetics.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich cross-section clearly emphasized with distinct textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layers of the sandwich, such as lettuce, cheese, and meat, are simplified and stylized with bold colors and simplified textures. While these elements are visually distinct, the focus is more on the artistic representation rather than precise textural detail. The clear separation of sandwich components is evident, but the emphasis on texture is more abstract and less detailed compared to a realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Has the lettuce been simplified into smeared green shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce is depicted through stylized and abstract green forms that resemble smeared shapes. These shapes do not capture the precise details of lettuce leaves but instead present a broad, artistic interpretation using swathes of green paint. This reflects a simplification of the lettuce into general shapes rather than detailed imagery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate includes artistic swirls and strokes of red and green colors, which appear to represent sauce decorations. These embellishments are not present in the original image, suggesting they were added to enhance the visual appeal and align with the artistic style of the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized and vibrant depiction of food, which aligns with contemporary trends in restaurant menu designs that often employ artistic and eye-catching visuals to attract attention. The use of vibrant colors, abstract representation, and added decorative elements like sauce swirls are consistent with modern aesthetics found in menus designed to create a memorable visual impact.",
