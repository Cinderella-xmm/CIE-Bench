    "Question": "Q1: Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases the mango with visible pixelation, a hallmark of 8-bit graphics, where objects are displayed in blocky, square-shaped pixels, without smooth gradients or high detail. Such visual appearance is typical in old-school video games or retro-style digital art known for using 8-bit graphics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the table and napkin exhibit a blocky and pixelated appearance. When analyzing visual elements, such characteristics align with 8-bit graphics, which involve fewer pixels per inch and a more abstract representation compared to the detailed, smooth textures found in higher resolutions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "Image B appears to use a reduced color palette, evident from the use of limited shades and abrupt transitions between different hues on the mango and other elements. Such limitations are a defining feature of 8-bit graphics, which restricts the number of colors used due to technological constraints of early video game systems.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights appear as large, flat color blocks with minimal gradient transitions, which is indicative of flat shading seen in 8-bit graphics. This simplification reduces depth detail and mimics the aesthetic of retro visual styles by using colored planes instead of detailed shading.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B simplifies the composition's textures by focusing on basic geometric forms and pixelated outlines while reducing intricate details. This approach aligns with 8-bit graphics, where the emphasis is on broad shapes and forms due to the limited resolution and graphical capabilities of old systems, prioritizing simplicity over complexity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
