    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image display a soft hand-painted texture characteristic of watercolor illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a soft, diffused appearance with blended edges and muted colors, which are characteristic features of watercolor illustrations. This style often gives a dreamlike quality to the image, lacking the sharp lines and precise details found in more realistic renderings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bedding patterns from the original image preserved in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bedding features distinct star and floral quilt patterns in vibrant colors. Image B maintains these patterns but in a softer, less defined form consistent with watercolor art. The patterns are recognizable but appear less sharp and more fluid, aligning with the watercolor transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the colors in the image exhibit a soft blending typical of watercolor paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in Image B showcases colors that blend into one another seamlessly, without harsh lines or stark contrasts, which is typical of watercolor paintings. This effect is achieved by the watery diffusion and overlapping colors common in watercolor work.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible brush stroke textures or subtle variations in shading throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are variations in shading and areas that resemble light brush strokes, adding to the soft, artistic effect typical of watercolor. These elements indicate the use of a watercolor technique where the brushwork and water control create nuanced textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can detailed designs in the bedding, like the star patterns, still be clearly seen after conversion to the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The star patterns on the bedding in Image B are present but not as clearly defined as in Image A due to the watercolor effect, which tends to soften details. While the basic pattern is still visible, the details are less clear and appear more abstract compared to the original.",
