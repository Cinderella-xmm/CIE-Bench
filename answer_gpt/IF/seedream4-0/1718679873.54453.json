    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the robot now a miniature 3D articulated model instead of a full-sized giant robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot appears small and is positioned within a circular display case, resembling a toy or model. This indicates that it is likely a miniature 3D articulated model and not a real, full-sized robot as depicted in Image A, where the robot dominates the landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robot enclosed within a circular display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot positioned inside a clear circular enclosure, suggesting that it is encased in a protective display case, whereas Image A shows the robot in an open landscape without any encasement around it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are transparent panels on the surface surrounding the robot where tiny gears are visible. This suggests that parts of the display include transparent sections showcasing mechanical components, which is absent in Image A where the robot's surface shows no such details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display positioned on a hexagonal black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the circular display case mounted on a black base that appears to be hexagonal given its geometric edges, providing a stable platform for the display, contrasting with Image A where the robot stands directly on the ground.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the robot’s model number etched in a luminous silver font on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B features the number '1020' etched onto it in a silver font that reflects light, suggesting it is luminous. In Image A, there is no such base or etched number visible, as the robot is standing outside, in a natural terrain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a miniaturized landscape around the display that reflects the original scene’s elements (e.g., trees, terrain, distant city)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes small trees, rocky terrain, and hints of a distant city, mimicking the setting of Image A but on a smaller scale around the hexagonal base. This miniaturization is not present around the robot in Image A, which features a full-scale landscape backdrop.",
