    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot exhibit a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot has a metallic appearance with varying textures, which paired with common representations of robotics suggests a combination of brushed metal and matte finishes. These finishes are common in robot designs to convey durability and advanced technology.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robot displayed inside a hexagonal box labeled \"MECHA VANGUARD\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot standing in a hexagonal base, prominently labeled with 'MECHA VANGUARD' on its front. This aligns with the frequent use of geometric shapes and names emphasizing strength in sci-fi and robotic displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple weapons visible, indicating they are replaceable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed multiple weapons shown, including a sword and a rifle on or around the base, which suggests these items are designed to be interchangeable or accessorized with the robot, in line with the customizable nature of mecha models.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible detailed engravings on the robot's armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are small, precise lines and detailing on the surfaces of the robot's armor, which implies engravings. These engravings are often used in design to enhance the mecha's aesthetics and convey a function or identity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are visible joint articulations present at key limb connections (e.g., shoulders, elbows, hips)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the joints such as those at the shoulders and elbows are prominently visible, consistent with the design logic necessary for a robotic figure to have articulated motion, which is common in action figures and models to show possible movement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dramatic splash screen behind the robot depicting a futuristic cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B showcases a backdrop with a dynamic water splash effect and a futuristic cityscape, adding to the dramatic and immersive presentation. Such backgrounds are often used in sci-fi contexts to enhance the overall theme of advanced technology.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the background cityscape include high-tech elements such as neon lights, flying vehicles, or digital interfaces?",
