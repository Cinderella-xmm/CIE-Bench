      "question": "Does the bag in the manga appear as a lovable, moe-style anime character with cat-like attributes such as ears, whiskers, and a tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is a manga-style depiction, the bag itself does not take on a moe-style anime character appearance. Instead, it remains a bag and does not possess cat-like attributes such as ears, whiskers, or a tail. There is no visual transformation of the bag into a character, but instead, the cat character interacts with it.",

      "question": "Is the white bowl depicted as a lively companion character with a spirited and playful demeanor in the manga?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the manga (Image B), the white bowl is depicted with anthropomorphic features such as eyes and limbs, giving it a character-like quality. Its actions in the panels suggest a spirited and playful demeanor as it moves and interacts with the environment, which aligns with characteristics of a lively companion character.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "In Panel 1, is the bag depicted as happy and confident, grasping its straps, and is the bowl enthusiastic and slightly bouncing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the bag itself is not personified and does not display emotions such as happiness or confidence. It remains a non-living object. The cat character, not the bag, appears happy and is holding the bag's straps. The bowl is shown with legs, suggesting it may be acting characteristically rather than actually bouncing with enthusiasm. The panel illustrates a playful scene, but the bag itself does not show emotions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In Panel 2, is the bag depicted as frustrated and flustered, sweating nervously, and is the bowl rolling on its side, spinning chaotically while laughing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the bag is shown as sweating, which is an anthropomorphic expression indicating flustered or frustrated emotions, even though it remains inanimate. The bowl is depicted with limbs and a facial expression that implies it is rolling on its side, adding to a chaotic spin and suggesting laughter. This visual supports the notion of it being a playful and dynamic character.",

      "question": "Are all written contents in the manga, including text boxes and speech bubbles, presented in a cute handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text content in Image B, including the speech bubbles, appears in a font style that resembles cute, handwritten font, typical of manga intended to convey a playful, light-hearted tone. This aligns with the world knowledge that handwritten fonts are often used in manga to convey emotions and add to the stylistic charm.",
