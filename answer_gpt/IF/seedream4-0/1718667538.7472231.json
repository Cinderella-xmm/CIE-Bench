      "question": "Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiger in Image B appears to have sharp, defined edges with a flat appearance, characteristic of cut-paper art. The lack of realistic shading further supports the conclusion that it is rendered in this style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiger's stripes visibly wider and more stylized than natural tiger markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's stripes are more pronounced and maintain a stylized straightness and uniformity, which differs from the natural, varied pattern seen on live tigers.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows whiskers that are exaggerated in length and thickness compared to typical tiger whiskers. This stylization is consistent with the cut-paper artistic approach.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B is constructed with distinct edges suggesting layered paper pieces, consistent with cut-paper art, giving it a three-dimensional, sculptural quality.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
