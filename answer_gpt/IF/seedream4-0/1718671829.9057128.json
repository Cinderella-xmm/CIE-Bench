    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the structural lines of the cabin composed entirely of geometric shapes with no organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin's structural lines are depicted with sharp, angular lines and geometric shapes typical of Art Deco design, which often favors symmetry and precision over organic, flowing forms. This is evident in the bold, straight lines used throughout the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a glowing, radiant circle with visible light rays or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is illustrated as a perfect circle surrounded by radiant lines emanating from its edges, giving it a glowing appearance with visible light rays. This stylistic choice enhances the moon's prominence in the composition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the plants rendered in symmetrical, patterned arrangements instead of natural growth forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants at the bottom of the image appear to be stylized into symmetrical, geometric patterns, which is common in Art Deco aesthetics where natural forms are often abstracted into repetitive, balanced designs. This differs from the organic, irregular arrangement expected in natural growth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays prominent use of metallic textures and colors, specifically gold and silver, applied to the cabin frame, windows, and decorative motifs. This metallic sheen accentuates the Art Deco style known for its opulent and luxurious visual impact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds depicted in Image B are presented with stylized, geometric contours as opposed to organic, free-form cloud shapes. This abstract representation is consistent with the Art Deco influence seen throughout the image, emphasizing design over realism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window designs are characterized by thick frames and angular divisions lacking in curves or subtlety. These bold features align with the dynamic and structural emphasis typical of Art Deco styling, enhancing their visual impact.",
