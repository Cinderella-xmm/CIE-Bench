      "question": "Do the zebras appear as charming chibi-style 3D figures with oversized, adorable traits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras have features typical of chibi-style design, characterized by exaggerated and oversized heads and small, cute bodies. These traits are evident as the zebras have large eyes, rounded forms, and simplified features, which aligns with the chibi aesthetic.",

      "question": "Do the zebras retain their signature striped coats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras still have the black and white stripes characteristic of their species, even though their overall form has been altered to a chibi style. The stripes are a visual representation of a zebra's coat.",

      "question": "Are the zebras shown in realistic grazing stances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are depicted in a manner consistent with grazing, as they are bending down towards the ground. However, the chibi style transforms these actions into a more stylized form, thus they are not realistically depicted in the grazing stance typical of real zebras.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background such as the green field, trees, and fencing retains a level of realism with natural textures and details similar to the original scene described in Image A. There is no significant stylization or abstraction of these elements.",
