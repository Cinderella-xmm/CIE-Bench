      "question": "Are brass gears and levers visibly integrated into the desk surface or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe brass gears integrated into the desk structure, particularly on the side panels, which are aesthetically consistent with steampunk design elements known for incorporating mechanical components into furniture. These additions were not present in Image A, where the desk exhibited a more traditional design with ornate wood carvings. The presence of these gears and levers adds to the complexity and mechanical theme of the environment.",

      "question": "Do the books in the image emit a visible glow and contain mechanical bookmarks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, some books are shown with a visible glow emanating from their spines and mechanical bookmarks or tags attached to them, suggesting a fusion of literature with advanced technology, typical of a steampunk theme. In contrast, Image A shows a stack of traditional books with no such glowing effects, indicating that this is a change made specifically in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the globe on the screen replaced with a floating, translucent 3D holographic model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the computer screen on the desk displays a 3D architectural model but not a floating holographic model. There is no indication that the model is floating or translucent, rather it seems displayed on the computer monitor. Whereas Image A displayed a world map on the screen. The absence of a floating holographic representation suggests that the edited image does not include such a feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the window frames decorated with bold, intricate patterns characteristic of steampunk design, such as brass detailing or mechanical motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases window frames with elaborate, bold patterns that are indicative of steampunk design. These include mechanical elements and potentially brass detailing, replacing the more traditional and simple framework seen in Image A. This transformation signals the integration of a steampunk aesthetic in the edited image through such decorative enhancements.",

      "question": "Is the image labeled with the title \"The Time Traveler's Study\" in a stylized font appropriate for a Victorian steampunk aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, text reading 'The Time Traveler's Study' appears prominently, rendered in a font consistent with Victorian steampunk aesthetics - typically ornate and reminiscent of the era's stylistic conventions. This title is a new addition when compared to Image A, which lacked any textual labels or titles.",
