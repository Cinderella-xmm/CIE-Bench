      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire lighthouse scene enclosed within a spherical glass or transparent globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse scene is clearly enclosed within a transparent globe, indicated by the reflections and refraction seen on the curved surface, resembling a glass or transparent material. The globe encapsulates the entire scene of rocks, lighthouse, and waves inside it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lighthouse inside the globe depicted as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighthouse within the globe in Image B appears as a miniature 3D model, suggested by the scale comparison to the globe size. The scene is entirely contained within the globe, which suggests that all elements inside, including the lighthouse, are miniaturized to fit the dimensions of the globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves around the lighthouse inside the globe made of translucent blue resin with a stylized appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves inside the transparent globe have a stylized and glossy appearance. The waves are depicted with a distinctly translucent blue quality, resembling blue resin, suggesting a crafted and artistic representation rather than realistic water.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the globe rest on a wooden base with an engraved compass rose pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The globe in Image B rests on a visibly wooden base, identified by its texture and color. Furthermore, the side of this wooden base shows an engraved pattern resembling a compass rose, aligning with the typical nautical decor style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama visible in the background behind the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a detailed painted background visible through the transparent globe, comprising clouds and a distant mountain panorama. These elements extend beyond the framing of the globe, suggesting they are not part of the globe's miniature scene but serve as a backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the rocks inside the globe rendered in earthy tones (such as browns, tans, and greens) and the water in vibrant shades of blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the globe in Image B, the rocks are depicted in earthy tones like browns and tans, consistent with natural rock coloration. The water surrounding the rocks and lighthouse is vividly shown in shades of blue, distinct from the stylized resin appearance of the miniature waves.",
