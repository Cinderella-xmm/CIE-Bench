      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic pop-art comic design throughout the hospital setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues, such as the use of bold outlines, exaggerated texts, and stylized elements resembling comic book illustrations, indicate the presence of a pop-art comic design. The use of artistic elements like onomatopoeia and vibrant lines further emphasize the comic book style. Based on the distinct characteristics of pop-art comic styles, which include these vibrant and bold elements, the observation of such features in Image B confirms the presence of a dynamic pop-art comic design.",

      "question": "Are halftone patterns visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays halftone patterns, which are tiny, dot-like textures typically used in comic book and pop-art styles to create shades and gradations. These patterns are especially noticeable in areas like the clothing and background, where the texture appears dotted, creating a shade and texture effect characteristic of halftone printing techniques. Recognizing these patterns involves understanding their historical use in comic illustrations to produce detailed visual effects with limited printing capabilities.",

      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate striking, vivid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes striking, vivid colors, often found in pop-art and comic styles, which are generally characterized by bold and bright color palettes to attract attention and convey dynamism. The image uses intense blues, reds, and yellows, contributing to an energetic and visually impactful scene. The visual intensity of these colors differentiates the stylized comic representation from more muted, realistic photography.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are bold graphical details apparent as typical of a comic style, including strong outlines that define shapes and forms distinctly. These outlines, combined with simplified yet expressive design elements, contribute to the bold and exaggerated aesthetic prevalent in illustrative styles like comics or graphic novels.",

      "question": "Has the original scene composition been maintained in the edited image despite the style change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image A and Image B, the key elements such as the position of the patient, the IV stand, the screens, and the medical staff have been maintained in their relative positions. Despite the change in artistic style, the composition of the scene—defined by the spatial arrangement of elements—remains consistent between the images. This indicates that while the stylistic representation has changed, the foundational structure of the scene composition has been preserved.",
