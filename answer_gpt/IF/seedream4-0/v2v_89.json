        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handbag in Image B displays textures that are quite similar to those in a brain sculpture, characterized by wavy, layered patterns.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag visibly projects depth and volume, indicative of a three-dimensional object. Its form is not flat; the curvature and shading of the textures contribute to this perception, making it appear solid and tangible.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handbag in Image B integrates well within the organic and intricate design style that defines the brain sculpture. The continuation of wavy patterns and complementary color scheme aids in maintaining aesthetic coherence between the two pieces, suggesting they belong to the same thematic collection.",
