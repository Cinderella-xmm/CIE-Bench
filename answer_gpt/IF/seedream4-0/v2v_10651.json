      "question": "Do the bottle, opener, and glass appear to be modeled out of textured clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects including the bottle, opener, and glass show a rough, matte surface with uneven textures typical of clay models. The visual cues, such as the lack of transparency and glossy finish typically found in glass and metal, indicate the use of a clay-like material. This suggests they are made out of textured clay.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original materials (glass and metal) in Image A feature smooth, reflective surfaces. In Image B, these have been transformed with a rough, matte finish resembling clay. This suggests the original materials have been replaced by a clay-like texture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of objects to a clay-like material and the tactile, hand-sculpted appearance of all elements give the impression typical of claymation scenes. The consistent texture across objects supports the handmade, artistic style reminiscent of claymation.",
