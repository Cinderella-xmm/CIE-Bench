    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the cabin and surrounding landscape rendered with visible, dappled brushstrokes instead of smooth, photorealistic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the cabin and surrounding landscape are depicted with visible brushstrokes, consistent with the style of a painting. The texture of the image appears dappled and rough, characteristic of painted artworks, where brushstrokes create uneven surfaces. This is a contrast to photorealistic images where textures are smooth and closely resemble real-life appearances.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image softened and blended, with reduced contrast and no sharp edges between color areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a painting style with softened and blended colors, typical of impressionistic art. The transition between colors is smooth and gradual, lacking the stark edges and contrast seen in photographs. This style emphasizes an overall harmony and mood rather than distinct, sharp details.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the surrounding fir trees depicted with loose, expressive brushstrokes and enhanced or non-naturalistic coloration compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fir trees are depicted with loose and expressive brushstrokes. The coloration of the trees is vibrant and varied, incorporating colors not typically found in nature, like purples and blues, adding to an artistic, non-realistic effect. This differs from Image A, where the trees are rendered with more realistic color tones and detailed textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the chimney rendered as a soft, blurred plume with indistinct edges, suggesting motion and warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke from the chimney in Image B is depicted with soft, blurred edges, making it appear as a gentle, moving plume. This representation aligns with the painting style's emphasis on motion and atmosphere, contrasting with a sharper, more defined depiction in a photorealistic image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a snow-covered ground with visible snowflakes, maintaining the serene winter ambiance. These elements are essential in conveying the same peaceful, wintry setting as in Image A, blending them into the artistic style without losing the seasonal context.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylistic changes in Image B, the core elements such as the cabin, chimney, trees, and snowy ground are still recognizable. The cohesive style maintains the integrity of the original composition, ensuring that these elements remain identifiable, even though they are rendered in an artistic manner.",
