      "question": "Is the Aquatic warrior rendered as a three-dimensional model rather than a flat 2D image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior appears to have depth, shading, and highlights that suggest a 3D rendering rather than a flat 2D image. The presence of shadows and reflections, along with the transparent dome effect, implies a three-dimensional model. These visual elements are commonly used to portray depth and volume in 3D modeling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior enclosed within a dome that features marine-themed decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior is enclosed in a transparent dome, and the base of this dome has decorations resembling corals, which are marine-themed elements. These decorations are visually distinct and lean towards an oceanic aesthetic, matching common visual depictions of marine life.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the armor of the Aquatic warrior rendered in metallic blue tones with visible reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the armor in a striking metallic blue color. The armor features distinct highlights and reflections that suggest a metallic surface, common in 3D imagery where light interacts with reflective surfaces to create such effects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the trident maintain its large, dominant size and detailed structure relative to the Aquatic warrior's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trident is shown in proportion to the warrior, maintaining a large and dominant size relative to the body, similar to classic depictions where weapons are exaggerated for emphasis. The trident retains a level of detail in its construction, enhancing its prominence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the 3D model placed on a base that resembles a coral reef made of artificial or stylized coral structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B includes structures that resemble coral formations, stylized to fit the marine theme. These elements are crafted to appear like coral, and their arrangement supports the impression of a coral reef setting beneath the dome.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Are there swirling, miniature water currents visible around the figure, suggesting dynamic movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are swirling water-like elements around the base of the Aquatic warrior. These elements look like waves or currents and imply movement, commonly used in artistic depictions to indicate dynamism in static figures.",
