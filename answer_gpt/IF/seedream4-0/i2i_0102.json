      "question": "Is the word “Draft” written in a handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' has a distinct appearance that resembles handwriting rather than a printed font. This is evident through the variations in stroke thickness and slight irregularities, which are characteristic of handwritten text. Handwritten fonts often mimic the fluidity and variations seen in natural handwriting. Therefore, the visual cues suggest that the text closely resembles handwriting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word “Draft” placed on the yellow paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is prominently placed on a yellow paper, as can be determined by the color contrast between the black text and the bright yellow background. This placement on the yellow paper is clear because the text does not overlap or extend beyond this area.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image resemble a design sketch cover focused on presenting the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B highlights the word 'Draft' by positioning it prominently on the yellow paper with a pencil in proximity, suggesting a design or creative context. The blurred background, which includes a laptop, further suggests an office or creative workspace setting. These elements together make the image resemble a design sketch cover with a focus on the word 'Draft' as a key element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is plainly visible and legible. The contrast between the black handwriting and the bright yellow paper enhances readability. Additionally, the size of the lettering is appropriate, making it clear and easy to read at a quick glance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, besides the yellow paper with the word 'Draft,' there is a blue pencil pointing towards the word, and a blurred background that appears to include a laptop. Thus, there are additional elements present within the image composition.",
