      "question": "Are expressive faces and limbs added to the cookies to make them anthropomorphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies have been given expressive faces and limbs, which are not naturally found on cookies. This makes them appear anthropomorphic, as if they have human-like characteristics. This is visually evident as the cookies display expressions and have arm and leg appendages.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one can clearly see different cookies displaying varied expressions: a grinning smile, a pout, and a winking eye. These expressions suggest a playful and anthropomorphized design for each cookie. The visual cues of smiling and winking denote different emotions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an arrangement of miniaturized tea party elements, including a tiny tea table and teacups. This setup is reminiscent of a tea party scene with small chair props, further emphasizing a playful and imaginative scenario. These objects establish the context of an informal setting where the cookies are participants.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cup has not been altered to include architectural details like windows or doors that would make it resemble a clubhouse. It remains a simple cup with added anthropomorphic features to the cookies rather than transforming the cup itself.",
