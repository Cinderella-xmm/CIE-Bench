    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mountains rendered as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces instead of realistic contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted with sharp angles and flat surfaces, which are characteristic of geometric shapes. Unlike natural mountains that typically have smooth, irregular contours, these shapes have defined edges and clean lines, resembling polygonal forms often seen in abstract or stylized art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as geometric forms, such as triangular or stepped shapes, with no realistic leaf details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are represented using simple geometric forms, such as triangles, consistent with a stylized, abstract approach. There is an absence of detailed leaf structures, which diverges from naturalistic portrayals that would include more organic and detailed depictions of foliage.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the river composed of a series of radiating parallel lines rather than a continuous, reflective body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the river in Image B consists of radiating parallel lines, giving it a stylized, linear appearance. This differs from a natural, continuous body of water, which would typically have reflective surfaces and undulating forms corresponding to light and surroundings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all elements in the image outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents all elements with bold, clear outlines and filled with solid colors, rather than gradients or shading. This technique is often used in graphic or vector art styles, providing a flat, clean appearance typical of many forms of modern and abstract art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water does not show a symmetrical and geometrically aligned reflection of the foreground elements. Instead, the river's depiction with radiating lines does not support a mirror image as seen in more realistic or symmetrical reflections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible gradients or soft shading in the sky, mountains, or water, or are all areas filled with flat, solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The areas in Image B, including the sky, mountains, and water, are filled with flat, solid colors without gradients or soft shading. This choice gives the scene a more graphic, abstract appearance, different from more realistic depictions where gradients convey depth and lighting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image use a vibrant, high-contrast color palette typical of Art Deco design, including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a vibrant and high-contrast color palette, featuring bold hues such as red, gold, and blue. This choice is reminiscent of the Art Deco style, known for its use of strong, contrasting colors that create a striking visual impact.",
