      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall scene rendered in a pop art style with bright, flat colors and comic book-like aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is characterized by intense, vivid colors and use of simple, flat color fills which are typical traits of pop art. Additionally, the use of halftone dot patterns and the overall stylized, graphic depiction aligns with comic book aesthetics. This suggests a transformation from realism to an artistic, abstract representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train feature bold primary colors (such as red, blue, or yellow) and halftone dot patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B is distinctly rendered with a pop art influence, using primary colors like red, blue, and yellow. The presence of halftone dot patterns, particularly visible on parts of the train, reinforces the comic book-like stylistic transformation and contributes to the pop art aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the barnâ€™s wooden texture been replaced with stylized geometric shapes instead of realistic wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn's surface lacks realistic wood grain and instead displays flat, geometric patterns and blocks of color. The transformation from realistic texture to stylized shapes matches the theme of abstraction and artistic representation typical of pop art, which discards fine details for bold shapes and visuals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the trees and grass been converted into vibrant, abstract, graphic bursts rather than realistic vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of trees and grass departs from realism and takes on an abstract, vibrant form with graphic intensity. They appear as bright, colorful explosions and stylized patterns rather than detailed, natural foliage, consistent with pop art's vibrant and exaggerated depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image (train, barn, tracks, foliage) outlined with sharp, black lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features sharp, distinct black outlines around the major elements such as the train, barn, tracks, and foliage. This stylistic choice enhances the comic book-like aesthetic by providing clear separation between different sections of the image, reminiscent of pen-and-ink drawing techniques frequently used in pop and comic art.",
