    "Question": "Q1: Is the Aquatic warrior rendered as a three-dimensional model rather than a flat 2D image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior appears to have depth, shading, and highlights that suggest a 3D rendering rather than a flat 2D image. The presence of shadows and reflections, along with the transparent dome effect, implies a three-dimensional model. These visual elements are commonly used to portray depth and volume in 3D modeling.",
