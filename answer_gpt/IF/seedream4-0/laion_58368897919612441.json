      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the historic fortress within a clear glass enclosure.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground surrounding the fortress has a rich, verdant carpet that resembles moss rather than typical grass. The texture shown is uneven and plush, which is characteristic of moss and contrasting with the flat appearance grass usually has.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
