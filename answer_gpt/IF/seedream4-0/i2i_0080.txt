    "Question": "Q1: Does the image include a depiction of the dog from its left side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top two illustrations show the dog facing different directions. The dog's left side would be visible when its tail points to the right side of the image. In the top left illustration of Image B, the dog is shown lying on the bed in such a way that its body is turned towards the viewer, making it possible to see its left side. Therefore, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the dog illustrated from its back view within the image?",
    "explanation": "To have a dog shown from the back view, we would expect to see the dog's tail and little else of its body, as the view would mostly be from behind. In Image B, none of the three illustrations show a view primarily from the back of the dog. Instead, the illustrations show side views of the dog facing different directions. Thus, the answer is no.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are both the left side and back views of the dog combined into a single image?",
    "explanation": "A combined view would entail visible elements of both the left side and the back in the same depiction of the dog. In Image B, individual illustrations are shown with either side perspectives or full-body views, none of which combine the left and back views of the dog in one single image. Therefore, the answer is no.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the dog shown on the bed in both the left side and back views?",
    "explanation": "Both top illustrations in Image B show the dog on a bed, facing in different directions. However, as determined earlier, none of these illustrations show a back view of the dog. They only depict the dog from different side views. Therefore, while the dog is on the bed in side views, there is no back view on the bed. Thus, the answer is no.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the bed and bedsheet appear consistently in both views of the dog?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the top left and top right illustrations show the dog on a small bed with a visible arching headboard and a green bedsheet. The bed and bedsheet appear identical in both instances concerning design, color, and style, suggesting consistency across the illustrations. Thus, the answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
