      "question": "Is the clock tower in the edited image exaggerated and elongated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually represents the clock tower with an exaggerated elongation, as seen through the disproportionately tall and narrow structure, which is not typically natural but rather stylized, likely for artistic or design purposes. Such exaggerations are common in cartoon or stylized renderings to create a distinctive look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited version include a base of colorful geometric flowerbed rings around the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base surrounding the tower clearly contains vibrant colors arranged with geometric shapes, enhancing a playful and decorative appearance. Such arrangements are consistent with stylized or artistic interpretations, suggesting that this is not just decorative but also serving as a design element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the overall structure of the edited image appear as a vertical metal badge with a glossy enamel coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B mimics the appearance of glossy enamel coloring, often associated with metal badges or pins, due to the smooth, outlined design and bright colors that stand out. This stylization, combined with the vertical orientation, supports the perception of a metal badge design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the edited image displayed on a white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower along with its base is set against a stark white background, which emphasizes the graphic and color aspects of the stylized tower. This choice of background is deliberate in designs like badges, where contrast with the background highlights the main graphic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents the clock tower and flowerbed in a simplified and whimsical manner, characteristic of a chibi-style illustration. Such style involves reducing complexity for a cartoonish effect, including exaggerated proportions and bright, bold colors.",
