      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sailboat rendered entirely as a carved walnut wood sculpture, with no metallic, fabric, or realistic marine materials visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sailboat appears to be entirely sculpted from wood, specifically walnut, as evidenced by the consistent wooden texture and coloration seen throughout both the sails and the hull. There are no signs of metallic parts, fabric sails, or other realistic marine materials like ropes or metal fittings typically found on actual boats.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails made of smooth, polished walnut wood featuring visible and intricate grain patterns, rather than fabric or translucent material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B exhibit a uniform wooden appearance with distinct grain patterns typical of polished walnut wood. These characteristics suggest a solid wooden construction rather than fabric, as no translucency or fabric texture is visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hull of the sculpture feature deep, textured carvings that clearly mimic the appearance of wooden planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the sculpture in Image B shows textured carvings and detailing typical of woodwork that resembles planks. These elements indicate a high level of craftsmanship and mimicry of traditional wooden boat construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that elevates it above the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the depiction of Image B, the sculpture is clearly positioned on a pedestal that is both sleek and pale beige in color. The pedestal provides a base that elevates the sculpture slightly above the water, distinct from the rest of the image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the natural wood tones and detailed craftsmanship of the walnut sculpture clearly stand out against the background, without being obscured by similar colors or excessive brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The natural wood tones of the sculpture are in contrast to the somewhat muted and blurred background, allowing the detailed craftsmanship to stand out. There is no excessive brightness from the background to obscure the sculpture's details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water consistent with the wooden sculpture, showing the carved hull and walnut sails, rather than a realistic boat reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection captured in the water seems to align with the structures and contours of the wooden sculpture, including the carved hull and wooden sails. It does not resemble a realistic boat reflection with varied materials, but rather imitates the same walnut wood features.",
