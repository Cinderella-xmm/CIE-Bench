      "question": "Are there exactly four distinct bookmark-shaped objects in the edited image, each resembling one of the skyscrapers from the original cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four bookmark-shaped objects. Each of these bookmarks resembles a stylized skyscraper, but due to artistic design and abstraction, they may not perfectly correspond to the specific skyscrapers in the original cityscape from Image A. Their design is more iconic and simplified than detailed replicas.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
