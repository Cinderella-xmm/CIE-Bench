      "question": "Have the visible cracks and broken areas on the clock tower been restored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the tower still shows visible cracks and broken areas, indicating no restoration work has been carried out to fill these in or repair them. Without referring to Image A, it appears naturally weathered or damaged, likely intentional to create a sense of age or abandonment. Therefore, the damaged state remains unchanged in Image B.",

      "question": "Are there any gaps or missing parts left unfilled on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower exhibits several prominent gaps and missing sections, particularly in the area beneath the clock face where large portions of the structure appear to be absent. These gaps have not been repaired, suggesting an intention to depict the tower in a state of disrepair or ruin.",

      "question": "Do the restored parts match the original texture and color of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no visible restoration in Image B, the question of whether restored parts match the original texture and color is moot. The tower's texture and color appear consistent throughout, suggesting no alterations have taken place. Thus, we conclude that there are no restored parts to match with the original.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clear evidence of damage, but no indication of any restoration work. As a result, the question of maintaining architectural style and details in a restoration context does not apply, as the building's original damaged state persists. The architectural style remains as initially presented due to the lack of modifications.",

      "question": "Is the clock face intact and legible after the restoration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face appears largely intact and legible. There are no visible signs of restoration around the clock face; however, its preservation indicates that this portion of the structure has either withstood the damage or been well-maintained, albeit with natural wear visible in the scratches and minor imperfections, consistent with the overall weathered look.",
