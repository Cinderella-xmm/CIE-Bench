        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van is painted in a vibrant teal and white two-tone color scheme that is easily distinguishable. Teal covers the lower half and the roof, while white is more prominently seen on the upper section. This kind of color scheme is visually appealing and common for retro designs, enhancing its distinct appearance. Given the clear visual cues of two distinct colors forming a vibrant pattern, the conclusion is straightforward.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and color tones suggest a sunny scene. The sky is depicted with clear blue hues, and shadows are soft, typical of sunny environments. However, the colors have a slightly muted, desaturated appearance, presenting a retro or vintage feel. This style enhances the nostalgic aesthetic associated with the image, confirming the use of a sunny, slightly desaturated photographic style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a van that embodies classic design traits reminiscent of the 1970s, such as rounded edges, a two-tone paint job, chrome accents, and a distinctly retro angular body style. The addition of surfboards on a roof rack complements the typical surf culture of that era. These elements collectively capture the essence of a vintage surf van, aligning with the aesthetic trends of the 1970s.",
