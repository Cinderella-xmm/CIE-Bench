    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hat feature distinct geometric patterns such as zigzags, chevrons, or stepped lines typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, we see the hat decorated with bold, angular geometric patterns. These elements are characteristic of the Art Deco style, incorporating zigzags and chevrons, which add to the thematic design of the headwear. The analysis uses the color contrasts and structural lines within the hat's design to identify it within a historical art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible gold-colored accents along the edge or brim of the hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues from Image B show the brim and other sections of the hat featuring gold-colored accents. These sections are notable around the edges and outline the geometric patterns, which are evident in contrast to the turquoise and silver parts of the hat. The use of metallic gold tones enhances the luxurious appearance typical of high-end fashion hats or Art Deco pieces.",

      "question": "Does the hat display prominent sections of turquoise, cream, and silver in its fabric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat's design includes large patches and patterns colored in turquoise, cream, and silver. These colors are emphasized and coordinated together which reflect the elegance and distinctiveness of Art Deco. The presence of these colors is clear and abundant across different sections of the hat, confirming the assessment of its color scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative patterns on the hat symmetrically arranged across the crown and brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The symmetrical arrangement of patterns can be observed in Image B throughout the hat's design, where geometric shapes are consistently placed, mirroring each side across the brim and crown. This symmetry is typical of stylized designs that emphasize balance, a key characteristic of Art Deco design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric or linear patterns on the hat follow or complement the natural wave and direction of the model’s hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of the patterns in Image B reveals that the geometric and linear designs are contained within the hat itself and don't directly correspond with the model's hair waves. The hat's patterns stand independently against the hair, adhering to the hat’s thematic composition rather than interacting with the flow or direction of the model's hair.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the hat still positioned on the head in the same way as in the original image, with no change in angle or fit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image B with Image A, it is evident that despite the changes in design, the hat maintains its original position and fit on the model's head. Analysis of both images shows no alteration in the angle or how the hat is worn, confirming the consistency of the hat's placement across both images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Have the model’s facial features, expression, and skin tone remained unaltered from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ignoring the blurred face in both images, it is implied that the model’s attributes such as facial features, expression, and skin tone were left unchanged based on the editing focus solely being on the hat change. Comparing imagery and context, no alteration in the model's non-blurred features suggests an unaltered expression and skin tone in the context of the original image.",
