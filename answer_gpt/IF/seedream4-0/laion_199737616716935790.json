      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the motorcycle composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is clearly shown to be constructed using LEGO-style bricks in predominantly black and blue colors. This is indicated by the distinct shape and texture typical of LEGO pieces, with consistent color usage of black and blue throughout the motorcycle's frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the angular design features of the original motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature motorcycles with angular designs. Image B replicates the angular aesthetics seen in Image A through the use of blocky, angular LEGO pieces that successfully mimic the sharp lines of a real motorcycle.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wheel rims replaced with intricate cog patterns typical of LEGO mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels of the motorcycle indeed feature cog-like patterns, which are characteristic of LEGO's mechanical part style. This is a departure from the smooth rims seen in Image A, indicating a change in design consistent with LEGO styling.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful decals from Image A appear to be replicated through printed tiles on the LEGO motorcycle. This allows the LEGO model to maintain the visual branding and detail originally present on the motorcycle.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO motorcycle mounted on a smooth gray baseplate which features directional arrows. These details are visible below the motorcycle, providing context for the model's presentation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the blue and black stripes follow the same dynamic flow and positioning as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the blue and black stripes on the vehicles are similarly positioned and designed to convey a sense of motion and style. The LEGO model retains the dynamic nature and positions of these stripes as seen on the original motorcycle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model displayed within a clean, enclosed display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the LEGO model inside a transparent, clean, and enclosed display case. This is deduced from the visible clear boundaries enveloping the model, providing protection and a neat presentation.",
