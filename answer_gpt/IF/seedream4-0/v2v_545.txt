    "Question": "Q1: Is the sparrow depicted in a 3D-rendered form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow has characteristics typical of 3D rendering, such as smooth surfaces, defined contours, and a three-dimensional depth that suggests it is a digitally created model rather than a photograph. The sparrow details are stylized, and the rendering quality makes it look like a 3D object.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the textures on the sparrow and the chair appear polished and detailed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the sparrow and the chair exhibit smooth and refined surfaces, typical of polished digital textures often seen in 3D models. The wood grain texture on the chair and the sparrow's feathers are rendered to appear neat and intricate, contributing to the polished appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
