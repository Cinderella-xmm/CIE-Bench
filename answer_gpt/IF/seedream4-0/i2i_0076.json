        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'warm' is clearly visible at the top left corner of the image.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison between Image A and Image B shows that all original elements like the sofa, cushions, rug, plant, and wall art are still present in Image B. There are no alterations to these elements except for the textual additions in Image B, which are 'warm' and 'freedom'. Thus, the original elements remain unchanged.",

      "question": "Does the image convey a \"home living\" feel with warm tones, soft lighting, and cozy arrangement of furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a neutral-toned sofa, soft cushions, and a strategically placed plant that together create a cozy arrangement typical of a 'home living' feel. The warm tones in the wall art, coupled with soft lighting streaming through the curtains, enhances this atmosphere, establishing a welcoming and lived-in environment.",

      "question": "Is the text placement well-balanced so that it complements the rest of the image without disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'warm' is placed at the top left and 'freedom' at the bottom right, creating a diagonal balance that complements the image. These placements do not cover critical parts of the composition, like the wall art or furniture, which maintains the visual flow and coherence of the interior design, suggesting that the text does not disrupt the overall aesthetic.",
