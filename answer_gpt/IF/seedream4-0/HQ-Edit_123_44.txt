    "Question": "Q1: Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft appears to be encased in a display case, which is indicative of a 3D model rather than a real-life scene. The use of lighting, shadows, and the overall composition suggests a stylized approach rather than photorealism which typically attempts to replicate real-world visuals more precisely.",
