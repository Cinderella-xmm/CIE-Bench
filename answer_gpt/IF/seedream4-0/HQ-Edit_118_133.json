      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object mimics the shape of a teapot but now resembles a candle due to a wick protruding from its top, suggesting its function has shifted towards that of a candle. The presence of the wick is a significant indicator of a candle design.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
