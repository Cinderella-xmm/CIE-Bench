      "question": "Is the image now presented as an Ancient Egyptian relief carving etched onto a weathered limestone slab?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hatted woman portrayed as a revered scribe meticulously preparing a stylus with a device similar to the sharpener?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the scene into one with Egyptian-style elements and textures. Despite this stylization, the woman is seen using a sharpener. Although it's anachronistic for an Egyptian scribe who would use reed pens, the imagery fits the scribe theme through the meticulous action depicted and with the attention to detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the physical presence and posture of the man give him a commanding aura. The Egyptian-themed stylization along with the depiction of tattoos, similar to ancient decorative body art, implies a status of regality or authority, typical in artistic portrayals of noble figures.",

      "question": "Is the distant woman depicted as an attendant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's reserved position and smaller scale relative to the central figures suggest a role of less importance, often seen as an attendant. The positioning behind the main action reinforces the idea of a supporting figure, characteristic of attendants depicted in ancient art.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a stylization similar to that of ancient Egyptian art where figures are often shown in profile with earth-toned coloration to mimic stone carvings. The subtlety of incised details further enhances the historical resemblance, reflecting the traditional artistic style.",
