    "Question": "Q1: Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue of a wooden frame surrounding the scene suggests a boundary enclosing the artwork. The frame features intricate carvings, indicating it is hand-carved. This deduction is based on the visual texture and pattern visible in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the boat, water, and hills suggests a layered construction typical of cutout or diorama-style art, as opposed to a continuous photographic scene. Each element appears distinct, layered, and separated from the others, giving a three-dimensional effect different from a flat image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat is crafted to reflect wood textures like cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces. These details are indicative of wooden materials purposely designed to appear aged or rustic, achieved through detailed rendering of textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hills in the background are displayed in soft, gradient tones of pastel blue. This artistic choice contrasts with the realistic depiction of hills in natural green or gray shades, hinting at a stylized representation rather than realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, small, delicate droplet-like etchings can be seen on what appears to be a transparent layer above the water. These etchings mimic the appearance of ripple effects, contributing to the scene's layered and textured representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground, midground, and background are visually and spatially distinct, creating an effect of depth. The separation into layers is evident in how the elements are structured in the composition, similar to a diorama or layered cutout art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
