      "question": "Has the wooden material been replaced with transparent blue and teal crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is made of a crystalline material that has a transparent, glass-like appearance with blue and teal hues. This material contrasts with the wooden appearance in Image A. The visual cues in Image B, such as the light reflecting through the transparent material and the color palette, indicate a crystalline substance rather than wood.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the facets and angles of the sculpture accurately represent the fish's scales and curved body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sculpture with numerous facets and angles, which mimic the natural texture of fish scales and enhance the curvature of the body structure. The reflections and the way light interacts with these angles emphasize the intricate details that resemble scales. This is consistent with how a fish's body would typically appear.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit glossy, reflective surfaces that suggest water-like fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the sculpture is smooth, glossy, and highly reflective, reminiscent of water or ice. The way light playfully bounces off the surfaces accentuates this fluidity, which is a stark difference from Image A's solid wooden texture. The reflective qualities suggest a dynamic, aquatic feel.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting of Image B is a clean, white gallery space with minimal visible elements other than the sculpture itself, which focuses attention on the artwork. The lack of extraneous decorative elements or clutter supports a minimalist aesthetic, appropriate for art gallery presentations.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is displayed on a pedestal with a glossy, mirrored finish. This pedestal reflects the sculpture, enhancing its visual impact and contributing to the sense of elegance in presentation. The mirrored surface is visible beneath the sculpture, which aligns with the description.",
