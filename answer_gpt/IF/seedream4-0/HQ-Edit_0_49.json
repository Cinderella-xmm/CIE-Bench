      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show the teapot within a transparent glass dome. The dome is shown to be a smooth, curved glass that encapsulates the entire teapot, as evidenced by the reflections and the shape surrounding the teapot, indicating it is within an enclosure.",

      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually depicts the teapot sitting on a base that reflects the teapot and its surroundings, suggesting it is a mirrored surface. This mirrored base is evident through the visible reflections of the teapot and the cups around it.",

      "question": "Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small porcelain cups are present and arranged around the teapot in a circular fashion. These cups are evenly spaced in a ring, creating the appearance of a circle around the reflective base where the teapot rests.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot with ornate engravings, which seem to be consistent with the detailed patterns in Image A. However, there is no indication of additional engravings beyond what is originally present; the visible patterns are alike in complexity and design to those in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear visual indications of faux steam spirals rising from the teapot. These steam trails are depicted as curved and wispy, giving the impression of steam emanating from the teapot spout and lid, further accentuated by their spiral form.",
