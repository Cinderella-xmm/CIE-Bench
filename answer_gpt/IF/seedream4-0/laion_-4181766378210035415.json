      "question": "Is the bed fully constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, including the frame, mattress, and base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed is indeed fully constructed from LEGO bricks. The frame, mattress, and base are composed of interlocking LEGO pieces, which is evident from the uniform brick pattern and the iconic studded surfaces characteristic of LEGO. This design clearly uses LEGO construction throughout all parts of the bed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks used on the bed are not arranged or colored to recreate the specific botanical pattern from Image A. The edited image simply features white bricks for the bed frame and light blue bricks for the mattress and bedding, with no attempt to mimic the floral design seen in the original image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headboard in Image B is constructed with curved LEGO pieces that form a smooth, rounded shape. This is evident from the distinct curvature and continuity of the headboard, which contrasts with the flat design in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows are constructed from stacked smaller LEGO bricks. These bricks are arranged to create a distinct, three-dimensional appearance, showing individuality and depth, unlike the flat texture of real pillows in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
