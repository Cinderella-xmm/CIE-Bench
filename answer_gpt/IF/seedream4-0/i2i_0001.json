    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image showing a close-up view of the keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows the keychain in detail, with the hand holding it as the main focus, indicating a close-up view. A close-up image will typically prioritize one specific object or area in the photo without revealing additional peripheral elements, which aligns with the presentation in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain appear to be made of soft rubber with bold black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B displays characteristics typical of soft rubber materials, such as consistent color and smooth texture. Its bold black outlines also suggest a design often used to define edges in rubber keys, emphasizing the shapes and sections distinctively.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain feature a chibi-style representation of the character shown in the attached image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi style typically involves exaggerated features, such as large eyes and a cute aesthetic. The keychain exhibits these traits—oversized, simplistic eyes and a minimized form—indicative of chibi characterization. This suggests a playful and stylized depiction of the character resembling 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the keychain attached to a small silver keyring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the keychain affixed to a metal hoop appearing silver, characterized by its shiny and metallic texture, typical of keyring components, thereby confirming its attachment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is visually unobtrusive, lacking complex colors or patterns that could detract attention from the foreground. This suggests neutrality to allow focus on the keychain, consistent with backgrounds designed not to interfere with the main subject's depiction.",
