    "Question": "Q1: Is the vase now composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics the original shape?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is visibly made of a clear and faceted material, which is characteristic of crystal. This material is reflective and refracts light, giving it the appearance of being a crystal vase. This new vase retains the same general shape as the vase in Image A, which was made of porcelain with painted designs. Although the material differs, the overall shape seems to mimic or be inspired by the original.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface details of the vase consist of etched designs visible against the smoothness of the crystal structure. These etched patterns appear to be abstract and floral. Image A's vase has painted figures and scenes, which are different from the crystal's etched patterns that emphasize abstract floral motifs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are visibly pastel-colored and translucent, indicative of crystal material. Each blossom shows intricate detailing characteristic of carved crystal, lacking the texture and natural color variability of real flowers seen in Image A. This indicates the transformation of natural flowers into crystal representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the vase on a sleek, reflective surface, which suggests a mirror-like pedestal beneath it. This surface clearly reflects the vase and crystal flower arrangement, enhancing the overall visual effect. In contrast, Image A featured a more ornate table or surface without such reflective properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the crystal vase maintain the same overall shape, size, and structural features (such as handles and foot) as the original ornate vase?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the crystal vase maintains a similar shape, size, and key structural features like handles and the foot, as originally seen in Image A with the porcelain vase. Despite the metamorphosis from porcelain to crystal, the design elements like the vase's overall silhouette and detailing style remain preserved, reflecting the original's ornate nature.",
