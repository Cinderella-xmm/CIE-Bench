      "question": "Does the entire photo exhibit a bright and soft watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the photo has been transformed into what appears to be a watercolor painting. The colors are soft and blended, creating a diffuse, bright appearance characteristic of watercolor art. This style is enhanced by the gentle transitions between colors and the overall luminous quality of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ground depicted using semi-abstract brushstrokes with slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B appears to be painted with watercolor techniques, which typically involve blending and diffusion of colors. This results in an abstract style where details are less defined, and colors appear blurred, suggesting a softer, more artistic interpretation of the ground surface.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background buildings rendered with semi-abstract brushstrokes and slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background buildings in Image B have lost their sharp detail and are portrayed with flowing, blurred brushstrokes and softly mixed colors. This gives them a semi-abstract appearance, which is in line with the watercolor style that favors impression over detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Across Image B, there is a consistent use of watercolor effects which ensure a uniformly bright and soft aesthetic. The colors are light and spread evenly, creating a harmonious look that is characteristic of watercolor paintings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's position and posture, including the arms raised and the stance on what seems to be a skate ramp, remain unchanged from Image A. The alterations focus more on the artistic style rather than the pose or positioning of the character.",
