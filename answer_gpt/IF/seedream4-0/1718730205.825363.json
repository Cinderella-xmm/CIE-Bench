      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire image, including the cosmic vortex and forest landscape, rendered in the style of a stained glass window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex and the forest landscape are rendered with distinct colored panes outlined by thick, dark lines, mimicking lead cames found in stained glass windows. Each section is separated and filled with different hues, typical of stained glass, creating a mosaic appearance that is characteristic of this art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spiral patterns of the cosmic vortex outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines resembling lead cames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spiral patterns in Image B of the cosmic vortex are indeed outlined by thick, dark lines that resemble the traditional lead cames used in stained glass window making. These outlines create distinct sections within the spiral, which is a technique used to separate different pieces of colored glass.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sky and tree canopies depicted using deep, saturated colors such as deep blues, purples, reds, and greens characteristic of jewel tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used for the sky and tree canopies are indeed deep and saturated, including jewel tones like deep blues and purples for the sky, and rich reds and greens for the trees. This use of color is common in stained glass art to enhance vibrancy and luminosity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the stained glass elements (including the spiral and trees) exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures that simulate light refraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B shows a typical representation of stained glass where surfaces are designed to look angular and multi-faceted. These facets help in simulating how light refracts through such glass, giving an illusion of depth and a play of light characteristic of stained glass artworks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature soft, glowing light effects, smooth color transitions, and balanced composition that evoke a sense of calm and serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B uses vibrant, deep colors and distinct sections typical of stained glass, the nature of stained glass art does not typically feature soft, glowing transitions. Instead, it uses segmented color. The stained glass style in the image creates a more vibrant and dynamic feel, differing from the softness or serenity often portrayed through smooth transitions and compositions. Thus, the focus on bold lines and colors does not evoke as much calmness and serenity as smooth color transitions might.",
