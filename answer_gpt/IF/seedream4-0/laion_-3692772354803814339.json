      "question": "Does the bottle appear as a transparent crystal vessel with visible swirling ocean wave patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is indeed designed as a transparent vessel made to look like crystal. It features a distinctive swirling pattern reminiscent of ocean waves, which is visible within the transparent material. This design element is starkly different from any traditional bottle design and aligns with an artistic representation of ocean waves. Combining visual cues with the world knowledge of typical bottle designs that incorporate thematic elements, it is clear that the bottle in Image B is indeed depicted with oceanic wave patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the label replaced with intricate golden maritime symbols instead of the original text and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label on the bottle in Image B has been transformed into a detailed golden design centered around maritime symbols, such as an anchor and other nautical icons. This is a departure from the traditional text and simple label design seen on liquor bottles. Considering the addition of these ornate elements, and how they replace conventional text, the label in Image B clearly features intricate golden maritime symbols.",

      "question": "Has the packaging been transformed into a parchment-like scroll with aged texture and scroll-like edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B appears to be depicted with an aged, parchment-like texture and especially features scroll-like edges. This appearance mimics that of ancient maps or documents and provides a vintage, historical aesthetic. This change is evident when considering traditional packaging which normally has a smooth, consistent surface without the appearance of scroll edges or parchment textures. Therefore, the packaging has indeed been stylized as an aged scroll.",

      "question": "Does the top of the packaging feature a compass rose with metallic-looking directional points set against a parchment background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Atop the packaging in Image B, there is a visible compass rose, complete with metallic-looking directional points. These are set against a background that resembles aged parchment, consistent with the overall theme of the image which evokes a sense of exploration and navigation. The use of a compass rose along with the metallic elements enhances this theme, distinguishing it from ordinary packaging designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bottle and packaging exhibit ethereal qualities such as glowing edges, light refraction, or a mystical aura consistent with an elixir vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B, although artistically styled with ocean waves and gold emblems, doesn't particularly display ethereal properties like glowing edges or a mystical aura typical of fantasy-themed elixirs. The presentation relies more on solid artistic motifs rather than supernatural elements. Thus, the ethereal qualities aren't distinctly exhibited in a way that mimics a mystical aura.",
