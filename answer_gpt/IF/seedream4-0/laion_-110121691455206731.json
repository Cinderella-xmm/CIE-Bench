      "question": "Is the edited image a comic strip consisting of at least two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it can be seen that there are two distinct sections separated by a horizontal line, indicating the presence of two different panels, which is a common feature of comic strips. Each panel also contains unique scenes and dialogue, further confirming that the image is a comic strip with at least two panels.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 show the watch with a face drawn on its dial, seated at a detective desk, and polishing its metal exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the watch is depicted in an anthropomorphic style sitting at a desk with its band acting as a chair and is seen polishing its exterior using its hands, which resemble the character of a detective. However, the watch face does not have any facial features drawn on the dial.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, the dialogue bubble reads 'Time to solve this case, down to the last second!' with some unrecognizable symbols similar to scribbles, not the emoji üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Therefore, the dialogue is missing this specific element.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 visually depicts the watch character (referred to as Chrono) in an office setting with a considerable amount of clutter such as paperwork and various items scattered across the desk. Chrono is holding a magnifying glass as if examining clues, aligning with the description of a detective at work.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing both panels in Image B, there are no visible text or sound effect annotations such as 'tick' or 'tock' around the watch dial, indicating the absence of these sound effect visual cues in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image use a combination of greyscale and shiny silver accents to reflect the original watch's appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a greyscale color scheme throughout both panels, which matches the monochrome aesthetic of traditional comics. The watch, being the central feature, retains shiny silver highlights that reflect its metallic nature, similar to the original watch's appearance in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, particularly the watch dial in each panel, there are no drawn facial expressions or cartoonish features on the dial. The watch face simply displays timekeeping features without anthropomorphic expressions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the dialogue bubble contains the text 'No detail too small for Detective Chrono!' But similar to Panel 1, the emoji üíº is absent, thus missing from the dialogue.",
