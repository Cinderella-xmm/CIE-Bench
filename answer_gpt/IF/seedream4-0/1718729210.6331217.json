      "question": "Is the scarecrow presented within a box-like packaging structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the scarecrow standing on top of a structure that appears to be a box. This box has distinct sides and a base, resembling packaging typically used for retail or storage purposes. This aligns with our common understanding of box-like packaging structures. In Image A, no such structure is present beneath the scarecrow, reaffirming that the appearance of the box is an addition in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a nighttime farm scene with a dark sky, stars, and a field under moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a scene with a dark sky filled with stars, indicative of a nighttime setting. The landscape reveals a field that is lit softly, most likely by moonlight, suggesting it is a farm scene under the night sky. Similarly, in Image A, the background supports the same nighttime farm ambience, confirming consistency in the scene's backdrop.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the scarecrow's body been replaced with glossy, weather-resistant materials instead of natural straw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarecrow in Image B appears to have a glossy exterior, which can be associated with weather-resistant materials such as plastic or vinyl, commonly used for durability purposes. In contrast, Image A depicts a traditional straw structure, which has a more natural, matte appearance. The visual difference indicates a change in materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scarecrow's hat designed with a visible cavity or opening suitable for holding a candle, indicating it is a detachable candle holder?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow's 'hat' functions as a lantern-style structure, complete with a candle inside. This lantern configuration suggests that the hat is designed specifically to hold a candle and possibly detachable for this purpose. In Image A, the scarecrow wears a conventional witch's hat without such functionality.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are LED string lights visibly present in the image, either on or near the scarecrow or packaging, emitting a soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays LED string lights wrapped around the scarecrow, emitting a warm glow, which adds a decorative element to the scene. This element is absent in Image A, indicating the lights are a new addition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a decorative crow figurine placed on top of the box packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a decorative crow figurine is placed on top of the lantern hat of the scarecrow, not on the box packaging itself. Image A features flying birds but no stationary crow on the scarecrow or packaging. Hence, there is no crow placed atop the box.",
