    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the scene (road, sky, trees, poles) fragmented into geometric shapes such as polygons, rectangles, and triangles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene elements including the road, sky, trees, and poles are depicted as fragmented geometric shapes. The entire image uses a combination of polygons, rectangles, and triangles to represent each part of the landscape. This is evident from the angular lines and sharp edges created by the stitching pattern, which visually convey the fragmented style using geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the road composed of angular, non-smooth sections instead of a smooth, curving surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road is depicted using straight lines and angular sections instead of a smooth, curving continuous surface. The geometric abstraction breaks the road into clearly defined, sharp angles which contrasts with a typical road design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clouds represented as overlapping quadrilateral or polygonal shapes rather than soft, natural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clouds represented in a series of overlapping geometric shapes, predominantly using polygonal forms. The traditional soft and fluffy texture of clouds is omitted, replaced with sharp lines that define the boundaries of each shape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the telegraph poles rendered in a stylized, geometric form using angular lines and shapes rather than realistic proportions and textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The telegraph poles in Image B are stylized with angular and geometric lines, lacking the realistic proportions and textures typical in a natural scene. The depiction deviates from realistic rendering, emphasizing geometric abstraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as abstract triangular shapes rather than natural, rounded tree canopies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, trees are represented using abstract triangular shapes, deviating from the natural rounded and organic forms of tree canopies found in realistic depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image use only muted greens, grays, and deep yellows, avoiding bright or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a color palette dominated by muted greens, grays, and deep yellows. The colors are subdued, avoiding the use of bright or saturated tones, which reinforces the abstract, geometric nature of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clear sense of depth and perspective in the scene, with the road leading toward a distant horizon despite the geometric abstraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the geometric abstraction in Image B, there's a clear sense of depth and perspective. The road is depicted leading toward a distant horizon, using converging lines and shapes to imply distance and space, maintaining visual coherence commonly seen in perspective drawing.",
