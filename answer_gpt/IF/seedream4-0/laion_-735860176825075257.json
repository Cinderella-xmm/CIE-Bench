      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows window frames and plant motifs with shiny, metallic accents that resemble gold foil. Gold foil accents typically enhance elements by adding a reflective and luxurious finish, making these parts of the design stand out with a golden glow.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entrance awning is prominently colored in a vibrant red, which can be described as crimson. This bold hue stands out against the neutral cream background and complements the overall design by adding a pop of color.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background of each postcard rendered with a textured cream-colored paper appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to have a textured surface, resembling high-quality cream-colored paper. The texture gives the image a tactile quality that is characteristic of handmade or crafted paper, which often features a soft, fibrous look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The images in Image B show each piece with a geometric arch border around their edges. This design element frames the central illustration with a continuous, symmetrical line, contributing to the cohesive and classic presentation of card-like imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the postcards presented without any visible frame or border, maintaining a clean, borderless edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each postcard in Image B has a clear border defined by the geometric arch. Therefore, the image is not borderless; rather, the border is a significant design element, contradicting the notion of a clean, borderless edge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there exactly three separate postcards displayed, each showing a variation of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays four distinct images, each resembling a postcard with variations in architectural elements or motifs. Therefore, the statement that there are three postcards is inaccurate, as there are four identifiable segments.",
