      "question": "Are the buildings in the skyline rendered with pixel-patterned or grid-like luminous facades resembling a digital display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings in the skyline have facades that resemble a digital display, characterized by a grid-like pattern with luminous elements. This grid-like pattern gives the impression of digital pixels, commonly seen in digital displays and electronic interfaces. The grid-like luminous features are evident in the pattern of the lighting on the buildings, which suggest a futuristic digital aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings exhibit a glowing or luminescent effect, such as bright edges, internal illumination, or radiant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings exhibit a glowing effect through vivid colors and bright edges. These effects are achieved by incorporating internal illuminations and radiance, especially visible in the outlines and surface of the buildings. The luminescent quality provides a futuristic and neon-like appearance, which is not commonly seen in traditional architectural designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the trees been replaced with glowing, angular, circuit-like structures composed of lines and nodes resembling digital pathways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains elements where trees were previously located, now replaced with structures that appear angular and have circuit-like designs. These structures are composed of lines and nodes that mimic digital circuitry, contributing to a futuristic aesthetic. This suggests a transformation from natural elements to digitally inspired designs.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bridge illuminated with vibrant neon lights along its structure, creating a glowing pathway effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge is illuminated with vibrant neon lights, outlining the structure and creating a striking glowing pathway effect. This illumination enhances the futuristic and cyberpunk style of the overall scene, which is characterized by the use of bright neon colors and glowing elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene consistently feature futuristic technology aesthetics, such as digital patterns, glowing elements, and cybernetic design features across buildings, trees, and infrastructure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirety of Image B consistently displays futuristic technology aesthetics. This is evident through the use of digital patterns, like the pixelated building facades, glowing elements on architectural structures and infrastructure, and cybernetic designs replacing natural features such as trees. The whole scene is transformed to reflect a cybernetic, digital future aesthetic.",
