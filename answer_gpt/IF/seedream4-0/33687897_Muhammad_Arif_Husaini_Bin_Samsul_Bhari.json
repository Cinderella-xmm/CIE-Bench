      "question": "Has the mountain been transformed into a colossal mythical creature with distinct features such as a head, wings, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a transformation from a natural landscape to a depiction of a large mythical creature. This creature has clearly defined features such as a head, wings, and limbs stretching over the horizon, suggesting it is indeed standing where the mountain once was. The presence of these detailed, fantastical features indicates the transformation from a static natural object to a dynamic mythical entity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the mythical creature exhibit a stone-like texture throughout its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B displays a texture that resembles stone, which is evident from its rough, craggy appearance. This texture is consistent across its wings and body, enhancing the mythical and ancient nature of the creature, resembling statues or rock formations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the peak of the mountain clearly shaped and stylized as the head of the creature, including rock-carved eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the creature is situated prominently where one would traditionally expect the peak of a mountain to be. The creature's face has pronounced features, such as eyes, that are intricately carved and lifelike, attributing to the mythical appearance of the creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the ridges of the mountain extend outward into large, wing-like structures that appear to be part of the creature’s anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large wing-like structures extend from the sides of the creature's body, resembling what might conventionally be the ridges of a mountain. These wings have a deliberate and symmetrical design, suggesting an anatomical part of the mythical creature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the roots of the mountain transformed into limb-like structures that are visibly intertwined with the silhouettes of the foreground trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower part of the creature resembles limb-like structures extending downward, appearing somewhat intertwined with the silhouettes of the trees. However, these do not explicitly look like roots but more like the legs or base of the creature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the body of the creature is interspersed with vein-like glow emanating in shades of blue and pink. These lines traverse across its wings and torso, adding a mystical and lifelike energy to the creature that contrasts with its stony texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the trees is present but not in the same compositional relationship as in Image A. The creature's body stands dominantly, but its limbs are not visibly entangled with the foreground trees; instead, the creature is showcased in a separate foreground position relative to the trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is primarily on the creature and its immediate surroundings, and it lacks the same misty layer at the mountain base seen in Image A. The landscape in Image B is clearer, without a notable mist effect situated beneath the base of the creature.",
