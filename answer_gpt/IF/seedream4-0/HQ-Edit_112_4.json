    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Blue Jay rendered as a miniature sculpture made of a solid material such as ceramic or metal, rather than a live bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Blue Jay resembles a crafted item with a smooth, consistent surface texture common to sculptures made of solid materials like ceramic. The colors and shapes are stylized, lacking the vibrant, dynamic quality expected from a live bird, indicating it is indeed a sculptural representation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clear, transparent cover encasing the entire scene, reminiscent of a glass dome. The reflection and curvature suggest it is a dome, often used in displays to protect and showcase sculptures. This confirms that the sculpture is enclosed within a glass dome.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wooden perch is clearly visible under the Blue Jay sculpture. Additionally, there are distinct green vines wrapped around it, suggesting ivy. This setup is typical of crafting a naturalistic display within such terrariums.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small, crafted leaves dispersed around the base of the display. These leaves have a stylized appearance, common in decorative miniature setups, indicating they are intentionally placed as part of the sculpture scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the entire scene, including the dome, perch, ivy, leaves, stump, and base, collectively evoke a garden-themed terrarium environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All components in Image B—glass dome, wooden perch wrapped with ivy, crafted leaves, a tree stump, and a moss-like base—are combined to create a miniature ecosystem. This assembly is very typical of terrarium setups intended to replicate and evoke a garden or natural environment aesthetically.",
