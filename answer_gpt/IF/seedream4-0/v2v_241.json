      "question": "Are the horse and elephant depicted as chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the horse and the elephant appear simplified and cartoon-like, common attributes of chibi-style representations. Chibi characteristics include oversized heads relative to body size, round features, and exaggerated, playful proportions, all of which are evident in the horse and elephant's 3D models in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the horse still standing on the elephant's back in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is positioned directly on the back of the elephant in a manner similar to Image A, retaining the unusual stance despite the stylistic transformation to a chibi 3D model. Observing this consistency in the horse's position confirms its continued stance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background feature a photorealistic grassy field and sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a realistic depiction of a grassy field and sky in the background. This is evidenced by the detailed texture and coloration typical of photorealistic renderings, despite the foreground being occupied by stylized models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scene displayed within an ornate photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the scene within a decorative frame characterized by intricate designs typical of ornate styling, drawing attention to the intentional framing of the chibi-style models against the realistic background, which denotes a framing effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse and elephant rendered as 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse and elephant are depicted as three-dimensional forms with visible depth and contours, adhering to typical 3D modeling characteristics. Their chibi style does not negate their representation in 3D space.",
