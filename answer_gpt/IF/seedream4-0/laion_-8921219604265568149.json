      "question": "Is the cathedral and surrounding square depicted at a significantly reduced scale, consistent with a miniature model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral and the surrounding square are contained within a large, ornate display case, which gives the impression of a miniature scene. The presence of small-scale human figures further suggests that the entire setup is a diminutive representation, typical of a model. This visual cue, combined with the presumed context of miniaturization, clearly indicates that the cathedral and square are indeed depicted at a significantly reduced scale.",
