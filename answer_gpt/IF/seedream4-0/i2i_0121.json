      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character features a head that is noticeably larger than the body, combined with short limbs and a compact stature.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is indeed depicted standing on a structure that resembles a shell. The base has a curved, scalloped appearance typical of a clam shell.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character wearing a straw hat, a red jacket, and displaying a happy, cheerful expression.

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the character’s features (like buttons on the jacket and belt) simplified but still recognizable in the chibi design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual elements in Image B, such as the buttons on the red jacket and the yellow belt, are simplified to suit the chibi style. Although these details are less intricate than in Image A, they maintain their recognizability, which is a common characteristic of chibi designs where simplification aims to retain essential features while enhancing cuteness.",

      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base clearly visible under the character's feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell-shaped base is prominently displayed beneath the character, especially noticeable where the character's feet are placed. The base's detailed depiction of the shell's texture and color further accentuates its clear visibility. The visibility is enhanced due to the character's smaller stature in the chibi design, which leaves more room to display the base.",
