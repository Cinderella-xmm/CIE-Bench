      "question": "Has the clock been designed with a metallic material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue that suggests a metallic appearance is the shiny, reflective surface of the frame around the clock face which resembles metal. This combined with the typical metallic color gives a clear indication of a metallic design. Thus, this observation leads to the conclusion that the clock has been designed with a metallic material appearance in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the badge pendant preserve the minimalist circular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge pendant retains the basic shape of a circle, which reflects the minimalist design philosophy, characterized by simplicity and lack of additional decorative elements on the frame. Despite being part of a keychain, the clock face remains circular and uncomplicated. This agrees with the minimalist approach, thus confirming the preservation of the minimalist circular frame.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the proportions of the clock hands been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands appear to be in similar proportions to each other and to the clock face as the common design. The hour hand is shorter, minute hand is longer, and the second hand is thinner, which aligns with the standard functional design found on clocks, showing that the proportions of the clock hands have been preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible feature such as a loop or hook indicating the pendant can function as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a loop at the top of the clock frame, which is connected to a larger circular metal piece typical of keychain designs. This feature indicates that the object is intended to function as a keychain.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no additional elements besides those necessary for converting it into a metallic badge pendant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the clock with an attached metallic hand-like structure extending from the bottom, which acts as a decorative element, in addition to the loop for the keychain function. This suggests that there are indeed additional elements beyond what is strictly necessary for a keychain conversion.",
