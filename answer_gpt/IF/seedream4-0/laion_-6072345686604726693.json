      "question": "Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure appears drastically different from what one would expect of a traditional building. It takes on a fantastical appearance, resembling a creature with a large, intricate body constituted by artistic elements that mimic wings and a central head or torso. The overall composition and design imply a transformation into a creature-like figure, noting its conceptual departure from architectural norms.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a structure with large, metallic appendages that extend outward. These appendages resemble wings and feature ornate designs, contrasting sharply with traditional architectural elements such as smaller domes. The modified image clearly shows the transformation of these domes into wing-like structures, emphasizing visionary creativity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traditional minarets of Hagia Sophia are absent. Instead, the modified structure exhibits long, slender appendages extending downward, resembling legs positioned to provide balance or support, similar to how limbs function in living beings. This transformation suggests the replacement of minaret-like architectural features with leg-like structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structureâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases intricate and glowing patterns adorning parts of the structure, reminiscent of elaborate Byzantine art that uses motifs and colors. These designs enhance the fantastical nature of the creature-like figure by incorporating resonant art styles linked to historical contexts of architecture, different from the typical surface detailing of Hagia Sophia.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals a central element that closely resembles a large, jewel-like object. The surface of this element is adorned with cosmic imagery, featuring stars, nebulae, and galaxies. This changes the traditional appearance of Hagia Sophia's dome, bringing in elements of the cosmos and transforming the structure's core into a speculative visual centerpiece.",
