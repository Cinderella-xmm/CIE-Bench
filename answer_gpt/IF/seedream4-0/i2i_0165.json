        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator's brand logo, which traditionally appears on the top or front of appliances, shows the text 'Xu's Fresh Zone'. Visual cues like font style and placement suggest this is prominently placed. Combining visual information with the expectation that brand logos are distinctly visible, the conclusion is that the logo has been changed.",
