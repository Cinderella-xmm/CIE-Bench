      "question": "Is the golden car depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden car appears to have exaggerated features, such as large eyes on the windshield, a hallmark of the chibi style, which is a Japanese term for cute stylization, often characterized by childlike features. The car not only appears three-dimensional in its curves and form but also adopts the chibi aesthetic common in toys or animations. This combination signifies that the car is indeed depicted in a 3D chibi style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car look like it is emerging from the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden car is positioned such that it seems to be moving outwards from the boundaries of the photo frame being held. This optical illusion is often used to depict an object going from inside a framed picture into the real world, creating the impression that it's breaking the plane of the image into the viewer's space.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a human hand visible, grasping the edges of the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a human hand is clearly visible. It is depicted as holding the photo frame, suggesting how people typically handle small photo frames by gripping the edges. Human fingers are distinguishable, confirming the presence of the hand holding the frame.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the car retained its golden color in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the car's body remains golden, consistent with a metallic sheen typical of such a color. In the comparison with Image A, it is clear that the vehicleâ€™s distinctive color has not changed, signifying retentiveness of its original hue.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition from a flat 2D space to a 3D reality clearly depicted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transition effect where the car is breaking the boundary of a frame, transitioning from the inside (traditionally a 2D plane perception) to the outside where the car appears three-dimensional. This visual effect effectively portrays the concept of bridging a 2D image into a palpable 3D object in the foreground.",
