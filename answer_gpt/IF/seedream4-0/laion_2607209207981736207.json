    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original scanner completely replaced by a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual focuses on a box rather than a standalone scanner. However, the box features an image of the scanner itself, suggesting the design is for packaging. The presence of a box indicates the representation of the scanner in a packaged form, but the image of the scanner on the box itself implies the box is specifically designed for that product. Therefore, the original scanner is not completely replaced; it is repackaged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the packaging feature visible metallic textures such as brushed metal, chrome, or reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a packaging box with a distinctive shiny, reflective surface, which implies a metallic or chrome-like finish. This visual cue can be associated with metallic textures commonly used in tech product packaging to convey a sense of modernity and quality.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging exhibit an iridescent color effect with shifting hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the packaging in Image B shows a surface with colors that transition among shades of pink, blue, purple, and other colors, suggesting an iridescent effect. This shifting of hues across the surface is indicative of iridescence, which is often used in packaging to create an eye-catching appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a holographic display on the front of the packaging showing the scanner in operation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a holographic display but rather a printed image of the scanner in operation on the front of the box. A holographic display would suggest a dynamic, possibly three-dimensional effect, whereas the packaging here shows a static, printed depiction instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible grid lines or circuit-like patterns across the surface of the packaging that resemble data flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front of the box in Image B includes design elements that look like grid patterns below the printed image of the scanner. These lines resemble digital or circuit-like patterns, commonly used to symbolize data flow in tech-themed designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there tech-themed icons (e.g., circuits, data streams, digital symbols) and modern branding elements visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the side of the box in Image B, various icons can be observed, and these likely represent features related to technology, such as circuits or digital symbols. These elements, in combination with the branding, contribute to a modern technology theme.",
