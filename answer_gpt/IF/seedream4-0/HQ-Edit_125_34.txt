    "Question": "Q1: Are brass gears and levers visibly integrated into the desk surface or structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe brass gears integrated into the desk structure, particularly on the side panels, which are aesthetically consistent with steampunk design elements known for incorporating mechanical components into furniture. These additions were not present in Image A, where the desk exhibited a more traditional design with ornate wood carvings. The presence of these gears and levers adds to the complexity and mechanical theme of the environment.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the globe on the screen replaced with a floating, translucent 3D holographic model?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the computer screen on the desk displays a 3D architectural model but not a floating holographic model. There is no indication that the model is floating or translucent, rather it seems displayed on the computer monitor. Whereas Image A displayed a world map on the screen. The absence of a floating holographic representation suggests that the edited image does not include such a feature.",
