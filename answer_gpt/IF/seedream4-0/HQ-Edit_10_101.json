      "question": "Is the surface of the image rendered with a visible textured canvas effect, such as fabric-like weave or uneven surface detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and the borders surrounding the portraits show a fabric-like texture with visible weave, making it resemble a canvas. This impression is enhanced by how details appear slightly raised or engraved, indicating a textured surface typical of canvas art. Comparing this with Image A, Image A has a smoother and digitally painted appearance, lacking the fabric weave detail seen in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the knit patterns on the cardigan visibly exaggerated, with enhanced depth, contrast, or stitch definition compared to normal knitting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knit patterns in Image B seem to be heavily detailed with noticeable depth and contrast between the knit sections, which enhances the stitch definition. The cardigan appears more pronounced, almost sculptural, compared to how knit patterns normally look. In comparison, Image A portrays a more typical knit texture without the exaggerated depth or contrast found in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the buttons on the cardigan exhibit metallic sheen or reflective qualities, such as highlights, shine, or a non-matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buttons in Image B display characteristics of metallic sheen, with visible highlights that give them a reflective quality. They appear shiny and stand out from the overall matte texture of the cardigan. Compared to Image A, where buttons seem less reflective and have a flatter appearance, the differences indicate that Image B portrays the buttons with more metallic-like qualities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall color palette of the image use soft, warm tones (such as muted golds, creams, or earthy browns) rather than cool or neutral colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an overall palette featuring soft, warm tones, with shades of muted browns and creams that contribute to a cozy, inviting feel. This contrasts with Image A, where cooler tones are dominant, such as the blue wallpaper, which suggests a more neutral or cold ambiance compared to the warm palette of Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible detailed embroidery or decorative stitching along the edges of the frame surrounding the portrait?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame surrounding the portrait is adorned with detailed decorative stitching or embroidery, showcasing floral elements and patterns along the edges. This is distinct from Image A, where the frame design is simpler and lacks such intricate needlework, making the decorative elements in Image B more prominent and elaborate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the manâ€™s face, hair, glasses, and general posture clearly preserved and unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is blurred and not the focus, the man's hair and general posture appear similar between both images. However, due to the artistic edits in Image B and changes elsewhere, this question is better answered by the observable content, relying only on the unaltered aspects such as posture and visible elements like the hair. Given these parameters, factors like hairstyle and pose suggest continuity across both images.",
