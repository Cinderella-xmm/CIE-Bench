      "question": "Are the bookshelf and books fully constructed from LEGO bricks instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf and books are crafted from LEGO bricks. This is evident from the distinct appearance of LEGO pieces: they have the classic stud-and-tube design on top, and a uniform, molded plastic look typically associated with LEGO bricks. The visual characteristics such as consistent shapes and plastic finish suggest that the items are not made of wood, which would display grain and variability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all books represented as individual LEGO blocks in earthy tones (e.g., brown, tan, terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the books are fashioned from LEGO blocks, and their color scheme features earthy tones such as brown, tan, and terracotta. The consistent shape and coloring of the blocks reflect the typical LEGO palette when attempting to mimic natural earth hues, providing a visual similarity to wood but clearly distinct as plastic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the intricate carvings on the original shelf and book spines replicated using darker LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while some of the intricate designs are suggested, they are not perfectly replicated due to the limitations of LEGO blocks. LEGO does not typically feature intricate carvings and details inherent in wooden objects. Although some patterns are visually darker to suggest detail, they cannot precisely mimic the carved effects seen in wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the LEGO tower narrow progressively toward the top, forming a tapered shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO structure appears to taper as it extends upwards. The design of the stack of blocks does indeed show a narrowing toward the top. This is achieved through reducing the width at each successive level, forming a distinctly tapered shape reminiscent of tower designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO structure smooth and plastic-like, lacking any wood grain or natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO structure exhibits a smooth and uniform appearance inherent to plastic materials. The surface lacks any visible grain or the texture typically associated with natural wood, emphasizing the synthetic, plastic nature of LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background plain and muted, without any patterns or textures, to highlight the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears plain and muted, focusing attention on the LEGO structure. While there is a subtle and understated texture to the wall, it's minimal enough that it does not detract from the primary focus of the image, which is the LEGO tower.",
