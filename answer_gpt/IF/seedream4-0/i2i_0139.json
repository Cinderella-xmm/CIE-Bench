      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the carrot now growing inside a space greenhouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment surrounding the carrot appears highly controlled with metallic walls and artificial lighting typical of a space greenhouse or controlled agricultural environment. These elements, along with the presence of the chamber and synthetic substrate, strongly suggest a space greenhouse setting rather than a natural Earth environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include a metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber surrounding the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays metallic structures with components often associated with climate-controlled environments like closed doors, ventilation systems, and artificial lighting. These features suggest that the carrot is within a specialized chamber designed to regulate growth conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carrot now rooted in synthetic substrate instead of natural soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrot in Image B is seen with a base that appears to be a synthetic substrate, given its uniform texture and appearance. This substance contrasts with the more varied and organic look of natural soil, indicating a synthetic growing medium.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the carrot appear visibly rooted in the synthetic substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is positioned within the synthetic substrate, which is visible at its base. However, there's no clear indication that it continues below the synthetic surface, which might suggest that while it is placed there, the rooting isn't explicitly visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has all evidence of the original outdoor garden environment been removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a complete transformation of the environment from an outdoor garden to an indoor, metallic chamber setting. The natural elements such as soil and surrounding outdoor greenery seen in Image A are entirely replaced by artificial components.",
