      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box containing the collectible figure in Image B is depicted with three-dimensional angles and lines, giving it an isometric projection appearance. Isometric projection is a way to visually represent three dimensions in two-dimensional drawings, highlighting the structure with a uniform perspective that doesn't converge at a single point.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle inside the display box is enhanced with glowing neon accents around the wheels and platform, evoking a futuristic, stylized design. Additionally, a visible digital interface within the box provides a further element of sophistication and advanced technology, suggesting an embellished version compared to a traditional motorcycle. However, the presence of hover wheels isn't confirmed visually from the image.",

      "explanation": "The text 'FUTURE RIDER' is prominently displayed on the box in Image B. This is assessed by visually examining the lettering for correctness in spelling and clarity, which appears to be accurate and stands out due to its large, bold font.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a robot stands next to the display box, not another motorcycle. The original depiction of the motorcycle in Image A features realistic textures and metallic finishes indicative of a full-size motorcycle. In contrast, the display box in Image B contains the same stylized motorcycle, not a second depiction featuring ultra-realistic details.",
