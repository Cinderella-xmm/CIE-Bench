      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B depicts a stylized, cartoon-like representation of a dog with characteristics similar to a German Shepherd, including the coloration and elongated muzzle.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain has thick black lines defining the edges of the dog illustration, which is a common design element to emphasize figures in cartoon or chibi-style artwork.
