      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and banana do not appear as a single unified form. The dog is distinct from the banana, as there are no visible indications that they have been merged or blended together. The dog, resembling a toy or digitally rendered model, stands beside the banana, which retains its natural shape and texture. Therefore, they are portrayed as separate, identifiable objects in the image.",

      "question": "Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a blended form as the dog and banana are portrayed as distinct objects. The chihuahua-like dog's appearance is similar to a stylized or artistic rendering, resembling a toy due to its uniform color and texture, which contrast with the natural appearance of the banana. This indicates a clear distinction, showing mismatched realism and providing obvious signs of creative manipulation.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no transition between the dog and banana as they are not connected or blended into a single form. The dog is depicted separately next to the banana with clear separation between the two. Thus, the concept of transition does not apply here as the two objects are not joined or blended together.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no blended form, but both the dog and banana maintain their proportions relative to each other based on the visual cues provided. The dog appears to be smaller, resembling a toy, which creates an interesting, albeit unrealistic, comparative scale with the banana. The consistency in portrayal fits within the intended artistic or imaginative style, rather than a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there isn't a blended form, both the dog and the banana appear under consistent lighting conditions, as both objects reflect similar shadows and highlights consistent with the direction of light. This suggests that they were edited or rendered with consideration to ensure cohesive lighting, even if their appearances diverge in style.",
