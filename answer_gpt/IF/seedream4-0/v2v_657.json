      "question": "Is the individual depicted within a Funko Pop figure box in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box is seen from a slightly elevated angle, which is typical of an isometric perspective that provides a three-dimensional appearance. This angle allows one to see multiple sides of the box, which is consistent with how Funko Pop boxes are usually displayed in images. Therefore, the appearance matches the characteristics of an isometric perspective.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text on the front of the box reads 'SKATEBOARDER', clearly indicating the theme of the figurine inside.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi-style figurine inside the box, which is characterized by its short, cute, and cartoonish proportions, typical of Funko Pop figures. The figurine is clearly visible inside the transparent panel of the box and is equipped with a skateboard, wearing a helmet, jeans, and a black shirt, matching the common attire of a skateboarder.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine placed outside the box does not have a realistic portrayal. Instead, it maintains the chibi-style with simplified features and is consistent with the style of the figure inside the box. The lighting and textures do not aim for realism but instead highlight the collectible toy nature of the figure.",

      "explanation": "Image B depicts a box with the characteristic design and branding of a Funko Pop figure. The box design includes recognizable elements such as the Pop! logo, the number '00', and artistic styling on the box’s exterior, all consistent with how Funko Pops are marketed. Thus, the image adheres to the standard design style of Funko Pop boxes.",
