      "question": "Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged in a recognizable outline of a human figure on the plate. This can be primarily deduced from the alignment and arrangement of the sushi, which resemble common features of a human figure such as a head, body, arms, and legs. World knowledge aids in identifying this alignment as a typical representation of a simplified human shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the right arm of the sushi person figure appears to be composed of sushi pieces aligned upwards at an angle, suggesting a raised position. This can be concluded by visually tracing the arrangement of sushi pieces from what appears to be the shoulder to the end of the arm, where it is noticeably higher than the rest of the body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable assembly of sushi that aligns horizontally from the torso, suggesting the presence of a left arm. This arrangement corresponds with the typical location of a left arm on a human body. This coherency in position allows for the interpretation that the figure includes a left arm positioned appropriately.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two vertical arrangements of sushi pieces extend from the lower part of the torso, mimicking the position and shape of human legs. This recognizable separation and alignment help confirm the representation of both legs in the figure using sushi.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head of the person figure represented by sushi pieces and distinguishable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head of the person figure in Image B appears to be represented by a round assembly of sushi pieces placed above the main body. This placement and distinct separation from the torso are consistent with a typical representation of a human head, making it distinguishable and clear.",
