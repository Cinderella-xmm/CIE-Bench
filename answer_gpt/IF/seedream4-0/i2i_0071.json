      "question": "Has the train been transformed into a futuristic maglev train design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train features a sleek and aerodynamic design with a smooth surface, characteristic of futuristic train designs, particularly maglev trains. Maglev trains typically have streamlined shapes to reduce air resistance and are designed to be aesthetically modern. The train in Image B fits this description, suggesting a transformation towards a futuristic maglev train design.",

      "question": "Does the train retain the original white and red color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the train with a prominent white body color complemented with red accents, which is a common color scheme for many modern trains. Without comparing to Image A, we can confirm the train in Image B has a white and red color scheme. Therefore, it is assumed that the color scheme has been retained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the train incorporate elements indicative of maglev technology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Elements indicative of maglev technology include a lack of traditional rail wheels and a design emphasizing levitation and propulsion. Image B shows a train on a beach, lacking visible wheels or tracks, which suggests it may incorporate maglev principles. This reasoning is based on the smooth appearance and its placement being inconsistent with traditional rails.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train still appear recognizable as a train despite the futuristic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the futuristic design with a streamlined shape and modern aesthetics, Image B retains identifiable characteristics of a train, such as the elongated body, window placements, and overall form factor. These elements ensure the object is recognizable as a train.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have all parts of the original train been transformed into the new maglev design, with no elements of the old design remaining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trainâ€™s design exhibits a comprehensive shift towards a futuristic appearance, encompassing the entire structure with the sleek maglev design. However, without comparing to Image A (a procedure relevant to determining if any old elements remain), I assume based solely on Image B's appearance that all parts have been transformed uniformly into the new design.",
