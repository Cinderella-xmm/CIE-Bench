        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is evident that the entire urban street scene is constructed with Lego bricks. The visual cues show discernible Lego bricks used to recreate aspects like buildings, street, and details of the scene such as vegetation and street lamps. The entire setting has the consistent look of a Lego diorama, indicating that Lego bricks have been used throughout.",

      "question": "Are the cobblestones on the path represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestones on the path are represented by a regular pattern of interlocking Lego pieces that mimic the texture and appearance of cobblestones. The varying shades and sizes of the Lego pieces create an effect similar to that of real cobblestones, which clearly indicates the use of Lego bricks to represent the path.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings in the background are distinctly constructed with Lego bricks. The color, texture, and modular appearance typical of Lego construction sets are evident, showing that the buildings are crafted using Lego bricks. This is consistent with the observation that all elements in the image appear to be made from Lego.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a Lego figure that represents a man, dressed in what appears to be a blue Lego jacket, black Lego pants, and a cap. The figure also holds a brown Lego bag. The recognizable features of a Lego minifigure, with simplified shapes and bright colors, affirm that the man and his items are indeed represented using Lego bricks in this edited image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and perspective of the urban street scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the composition and perspective, Image B mirrors Image A's original urban street scene with a similar angle and layout. Image A shows the back of a man walking down an urban street with a cobblestone path and buildings lined on either side. Image B replicates this setup using Lego, preserving the same back view of the figure strolling down a similarly cobbled path with Lego buildings aligning the street. This suggests that the edited image maintains the original composition and perspective.",
