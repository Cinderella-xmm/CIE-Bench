    "Question": "Q1: Is the background showing an African savanna scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a dark, largely indistinguishable land area under a night sky. The image does not present clear details or elements typical of an African savanna, such as distinctive wildlife, typical tree types like acacias, or a recognizable landscape. Thus, the visual information provided does not strongly suggest an African savanna scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the sky is dark with visible stars, which clearly indicates nighttime. The lack of daylight and the presence of stars typically signify a night-time setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
    "explanation": "The edited image displays a prominent band of light across the sky, characterized by distinct colors and patterns typical of the Milky Way. This suggests that the Milky Way is intended to be a significant feature in the sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are multiple stars visible alongside the Milky Way in the sky?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, numerous points of light resembling stars are scattered across the night sky, surrounding the bright band that represents the Milky Way. This abundance of small light sources is consistent with a star-filled sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the train and railway tracks appear seamlessly integrated into the savanna background?",
    "explanation": "The train and railway tracks in Image B appear to be positioned against a dark, possibly savanna-like landscape. However, upon close inspection, they do not blend seamlessly due to lighting inconsistencies and contrast between the train/tracks and the dimly lit background. This lack of visual cohesion suggests that they were added or heavily modified in the editing process.",
    "answer": "No"
