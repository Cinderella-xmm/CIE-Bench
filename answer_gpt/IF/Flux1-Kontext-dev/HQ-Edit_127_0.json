      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase 'THE NOCTURNAL OBSERVER'S GUIDE' is prominently displayed in a bold font across the lower section of the image. It is clearly set apart from the other text, making it easily noticeable as the title of the image. This is a direct visual observation that aligns with common title presentation in posters or guide covers.",

      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding foliage display lush, highly detailed botanical features consistent with a scientific illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree and surrounding foliage are depicted with intricate detailing. The texture and structure of the tree bark and the defined leaves exhibit a level of detail that is reminiscent of scientific illustrations, which are often characterized by their precise and detailed depiction of botanical subjects. This analysis involves recognizing the style of detailed rendering common in scientific or educational materials.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the image dominated by earthy tones, particularly highlighting the owl’s brown and cream plumage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an owl with distinct brown and cream colors in its plumage. These colors are warm, earthy tones which are prevalent throughout the scene, including the tree bark and surrounding foliage. The owl's coloring stands out and is consistent with the use of earthy tones, commonly used to depict natural and wildlife subjects realistically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible labels pointing to and identifying the owl’s talons and feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are labels pointing towards different parts of the owl, such as its talons and feathers. These labels seem to be intended to highlight specific features of the owl, which is characteristic of educational or scientific diagrams where annotations are used to identify and explain parts of a subject.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a dotted diagram with labeled lunar phases (e.g., waxing gibbous, full moon)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the moon in Image B is surrounded by dotted lines suggesting a diagrammatic presentation, there are no additional labels specifically identifying lunar phases such as 'waxing gibbous' or 'full moon'. Instead, the dotted circles appear to be for decorative or stylistic purposes rather than educational labeling of lunar phases.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a text box located at the bottom of the image containing a short, descriptive paragraph about owl nocturnal adaptations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a text box at the bottom with a paragraph, presumably about owls. However, the text within this box is garbled and doesn't clearly convey coherent information on owl nocturnal adaptations. The presence of a text box is correct, but its content doesn't seem to clearly describe nocturnal adaptations due to its lack of readability.",
