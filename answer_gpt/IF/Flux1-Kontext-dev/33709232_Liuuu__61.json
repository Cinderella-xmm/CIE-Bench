      "question": "Is the tall building replaced with a towering automaton featuring a sleek, white, armored body and mechanical windows as apertures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a giant robot is prominently featured, replacing the tall building seen in Image A. The robot has a sleek white armored body and various circular and geometric features that resemble mechanical apertures or windows. This comparison establishes that the building from Image A has been replaced with a large automaton, as described.",

      "question": "Has the traditional Japanese roof been converted into stylized shoulder pads with embedded intricate patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features a robot with shoulder pads that have intricate patterns, while Image A shows a traditional Japanese roof. The comparison suggests that a visual transformation from a rooftop element in Image A to shoulder pads in Image B did occur. However, it directly does not show a transformation of the roof into the shoulder pads, as these are two different objects. Therefore, the concept of converting the roof into shoulder pads isn't directly supported.",

      "question": "Are all traffic signs replaced with holographic symbols that appear to float or emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible signs appear to be physical and normal traffic signs rather than holographic symbols. There is no evidence in the image of holographic symbols emitting light or floating as would be associated with futuristic modifications.",

      "question": "Are the pedestrians in the street replaced with robotic figures featuring geometric designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of pedestrians being replaced by robotic figures. The people nearby appear to be ordinary, not robotic or having geometric designs, indicating a lack of such replacements.",

      "question": "Has the streetscape been altered to include robotic elements and geometric designs consistent with a futuristic urban environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces a giant robot as a dominant element, adding a significant robotic component to the scene. Besides this robot, the general environment, buildings, and street surroundings don't display overarching futuristic alterations. Thus, apart from the robot, other elements reflecting a futuristic urban environment with geometric designs are not apparent.",
