      "question": "Is the entire scene reimagined as a conceptual tea brand packaging design, where the original tea setup serves as part of the product presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene presents key elements of packaging design, such as a box with natural imagery and label/tag indicating tea branding ('Zen Autumn Tea'), which suggests a conceptual design aligning with brand presentation. The items appear curated for display, supporting the idea of product presentation, rather than a functional tea setup seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central table redesigned to resemble a tea box lid with visible engraved leaf patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a box lid with leaf patterns. These engravings and the box's position parallel the table's aesthetic from Image A. The box lid serves as a reinterpretation of the central table from Image A, integrating similar natural motifs suggesting the transfer of design elements from a tea setting to packaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original tea cups replaced with illustrated representations of sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no direct representation of the tea cups or suggestions of alternative materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics. Instead, it focuses on a packaging setup with a teapot and a leaf-shaped rest, which differ from the original tea scene setup in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible tag displaying the text \"Zen Autumn Tea\" written in elegant calligraphy style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a tag with the text 'Zen Autumn Tea.' However, the font style is simple and straightforward rather than the elegant, flowing characteristics of classic calligraphy. There is no explicit sophisticated style present in the tag's text.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a leaf-shaped silhouette and rendered with subtle earthy textures such as wood grain or soil tones to suggest organic origin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the teapot placed next to a leaf-shaped item, but it is not enclosed within a leaf-shaped silhouette. The teapot itself appears smooth, matching the texture of the other items, without distinct earthy textures such as wood grain or soil tones to suggest organic origins. It's more aligned with a minimalist design fitting the packaging theme.",
