      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall structure of the building maintains the form of a traditional English manor-style house, with recognizable architectural elements like the chimneys, gabled roofs, and windows. However, the application of bright colors and the stylistic rendering that imitates an artistic style can give a cubist flair, but the building has not been replaced; only its surface appearance is altered. Therefore, the house is not composed of fragmented geometric planes but retains its overall realistic architecture, albeit stylized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original brick surfaces of the house replaced with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes rather than realistic masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the house with a vibrant and colorful palette, and its surfaces are rendered in a way that imitates artistic styles, but the surfaces still visually reflect areas that could be construed as realistic masonry. The appearance is more stylized than a complete replacement with geometric planes as seen in cubism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all individuals in the crowd been rendered as abstract, faceless, and scattered forms devoid of detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the crowd is depicted in bright colors and with a level of abstraction, they still maintain some basic human form. They do not appear as entirely abstract or faceless figures but are reduced in detail and stylized, retaining enough features to be distinguishable as people.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the grass surface feature a visible checkered pattern overlaying the entire green area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the grass surface carries the same coloring style as other elements, with bold and bright coloration. However, there is no clear indication of a checkered pattern overlay. Instead, the grass is rendered in solid colors with visually varied shading consistent with an expressive artistic style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the water reflection been transformed into a series of prismatic, angular shards that distort and fragment the image of the house and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water reflection does appear fragmented and stylized with the use of prismatic and angular forms, altering the reflection of the house and surroundings significantly. This suggests a deliberate artistic approach to creating a distorted and non-realistic reflection.",
