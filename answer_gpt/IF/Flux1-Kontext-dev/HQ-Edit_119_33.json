      "question": "Does the image display a consistent Art Nouveau style characterized by flowing lines, organic forms, and decorative elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflower backdrop and the decorative elements in the person's dress and accessories show a clear adaptation to the Art Nouveau style. The flowing lines visible in the sky and the stylized patterns present on the flowers and dress contribute to an overall sense of fluidity and elegance, typical of Art Nouveau. This style is often recognized by its emphasis on curvilinear forms and organic motifs, such as those seen here.",

      "question": "Are the sunflowers depicted with stylized geometric patterns and flowing, organic lines instead of realistic botanical details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflowers have been transformed into stylized representations that emphasize geometric patterns and flowing lines. This transformation aligns with the Art Nouveau aesthetic, moving away from the purely botanical realism seen in Image A, which depicts sunflowers with more natural details like shades and textures.",

      "question": "Has the braided hairstyle been replaced with swirling, ornamental motifs characteristic of Art Nouveau art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hairstyle in Image B retains the braided look and doesnâ€™t adopt the swirling, ornamental motifs typical of Art Nouveau art. Instead of changing entirely into abstract swirls, the hairstyle still maintains the structured braids, similar to those seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B does not feature obvious swirling, fluid patterns akin to the Art Nouveau style. It retains its original form from Image A without adopting the decorative flourishes that are characteristic of Art Nouveau fashion. The dress appears to be consistent in style across both images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflower field and sky incorporate elements like swirling clouds and stylized sunflower designs that resemble a tapestry of intricate lines and curves. This contrasts with Image A, which depicts a more realistic landscape with natural lighting and detailed flowers.",
