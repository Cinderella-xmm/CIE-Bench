    "Question": "Q1: Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is depicted with stylized features typical of a semi-cartoon style. This includes simplified lines, lack of intricate details, and proportions that lean towards exaggerated or simplistic rather than realistic. This style is generally used to create a more playful or illustrative appearance, often seen in animations or graphic designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
    "explanation": "The apparatus in Image B are depicted in a semi-cartoon style, where the focus is on simplifying rather than detailing, leading to less emphasis on refinement and high detail typical of realistic rendering.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Image B predominantly uses the colors teal and white. Teal is a color often associated with technology and science due to its clean and modern appearance, while white complements it by providing a crisp background, both of which contribute to a sleek scientific aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image include multiple monthly sections, each featuring a different scientific motif such as molecular structures or data patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain multiple monthly sections, nor does it represent a calendar format. The depiction focuses on a single laboratory scene without any division or variation that suggests monthly sections with distinct scientific motifs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not include any visible headers in a calendar format with monthly sections. It does not feature any text elements or design accents like headers with futuristic or tech-inspired fonts.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
    "explanation": "While Image B does include scientific motifs such as molecular structures displayed on screens, these are part of the laboratory setting rather than integrated into a calendar design. Therefore, there is no indication of data visualization patterns specifically as part of a calendar layout.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the image display a polished, reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper?",
    "explanation": "Image B, being a semi-cartoon style illustration, lacks the polished and reflective appearance associated with high-quality gloss paper. The visual style is more flat and illustrative rather than glossy or reflective.",
    "answer": "No"
