    "Question": "Q1: Is the scene enclosed within a visible decorative glass dome that surrounds the entire diorama?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly displayed within a glass dome. The curvature of the glass and the base underneath create the impression of a contained environment, typical of how objects are displayed under a dome for viewing and protection. This is evident from the visible reflections and the contour of glass that surrounds the scene entirely.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the snow in the scene have a delicate, powdery texture, appearing soft and lightly settled rather than dense or icy?",
    "explanation": "The snow in Image B appears to have a soft, powdery texture. The way it gently rests on the ground and covers objects suggests a light, fluffy nature. This texture contrasts with dense, icy snow, which would appear more compacted and reflective.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are all human figures in the scene noticeably smaller in scale and dressed in vintage-style clothing consistent with early 20th-century Parisian fashion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, human figures are small relative to the Eiffel Tower, in keeping with a scene meant to represent a miniature diorama. They are dressed in more timeless clothing, not distinctly vintage or early 20th-century in style but plausible for the era given their indistinctness. Less specificity in detail makes it hard to confirm if they're consistent solely with early 20th-century Parisian fashion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the streetlamps in the scene significantly smaller than normal scale and do they emit a soft, subtle glow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlamps are proportionate to the miniature scale of the scene within the dome. However, there is no visible soft, subtle glow indicative of being lit. While they are smaller due to the scene's miniature nature, no light emission is apparent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there small, leafless trees in the scene with only a light dusting of snow on their branches?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows trees that appear relatively small, consistent with the diorama's miniature scale. The branches are covered with an apparent light layer of snow, which gives the impression of a light dusting rather than being heavily snow-laden.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible cobblestone pathways, partially exposed and winding through the snow-covered ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ground surface is consistently covered with snow, without any signs of partially exposed pathways. If cobblestones were present, they would disrupt the uniform snowy cover visible in the scene.",
    "answer": "No"
