      "question": "Is the image rendered in the style of an Ancient Egyptian painted relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is distinct and reminiscent of Ancient Egyptian art. The use of color (such as gold and blue), the presence of intricate patterns and borders, and the flatness of the image all mirror characteristics seen in ancient Egyptian painted reliefs. These elements, combined with the hierarchical use of visual space and symbolic ornamentation, strongly indicate an ancient style.",

      "question": "Does the woman appear in a formal Egyptian pose with her face in profile and eyes facing forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted pose is similar to traditional Egyptian art where figures are typically shown in profile view with their face turned sideways but the eyes looking forward. Although the face is blurred, the body's posture and characterization emulate the stylized positioning found in historical Egyptian reliefs.",

      "question": "Is the woman wearing a royal linen garment adorned with leopard motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's clothing does display patterns similar to leopard motifs. While it might not traditionally be considered a 'royal linen garment' in authentic Egyptian attire, it can be interpreted as such based on artistic embellishments like the ornate collar, which is a common representation of royalty in Egyptian art.",

      "question": "Have the golden boxing gloves been transformed into symbolic gilded offerings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boxing gloves retain their original look but, within the context of the Egyptian theme, could be reinterpreted as symbolic items. However, there is no significant alteration or transformation into gilded offerings that clearly separates them from their original function.",

      "question": "Are the background palm leaves stylized as sacred flora within a hieroglyph-bordered scene on a sandstone textured wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features palm leaves and a border, typical of Egyptian artistic themes which often include stylized natural elements. However, the textural detail on the wall isn't visibly sandstone nor are hieroglyphs present; hence, it lacks several key elements specified in the question.",
