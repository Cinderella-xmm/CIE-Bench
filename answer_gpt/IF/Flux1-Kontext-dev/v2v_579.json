      "question": "Has the central green block been converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central green block is depicted as a three-dimensional object being held or interacted with by cartoon characters. It maintains its original form as a block with green color, but unlike other elements that have been transformed into characters, it still remains a block object. The analysis involves noting the visual appearance of the green block and comparing it to typical characteristics of chibi-style characters, such as facial features or limbs, which it lacks.",

      "question": "Have the red blocks been redesigned as lively supporting characters with charming, playful expressions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows two red block-like characters with eyes, mouths, and expressive facial features, which transforms them into lively supporting characters. They are depicted with playful expressions and anthropomorphic characteristics common in cartoon illustrations. The analysis comes from observing these visual changes from ordinary red blocks into character figures.",

      "question": "Has the environment been transformed into a romantic proposal scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting features cartoon characters surrounded by floating hearts and pink tones, which indicates a romantic atmosphere often associated with proposals or romantic gestures. Analyzing the iconography (e.g., characters' interaction with a single green block and the abundance of hearts) suggests an intention of depicting romance, often symbolized by heart shapes.",

      "question": "Has the background been updated with soft pastel colors and realistic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with a soft pastel pink color, contributing to a gentle and soothing aesthetic. However, rather than textural realism, the background maintains a smooth and clean look typical of digital cartoon imagery. The analysis derives from observing the choice of pastel color scheme and the general lack of texture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are numerous heart shapes scattered around the cartoon characters. These shapes appear similar to confetti or decorative elements within the scene, enhancing the romantic or celebratory motif. The analysis is based on identifying these scattered heart visuals within the environment.",
