      "question": "Is there a themed box with an industrial aesthetic design present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, we observe a box that holds various bearings, which fits the industrial theme. The choice of color, material, and the presence of metallic bearings complement the industrial aesthetic design commonly associated with mechanical parts and engineering tools.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the box displayed in an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the visual elements in Image B, the box is indeed depicted in an isometric perspective, as the edges and corners appear to be aligned in a way that creates an illusion of depth, typically seen in isometric drawings often used for technical or industrial designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there organized compartments within the box that elegantly showcase each bearing and component?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each bearing is placed in clearly defined compartments within the box, suggesting a deliberate arrangement to showcase the items. This organization is typical for display cases meant to elegantly present items.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a highly detailed, photorealistic rendering of the primary bearing outside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the bearing outside the box is rendered with notable attention to detailâ€”the metallic finish, reflections, and shadows contribute to a photorealistic appearance. This level of detail suggests an emphasis on realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the primary bearing outside the box accentuate its metallic texture and intricate design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bearing outside the box with a clear emphasis on its metallic texture, as indicated by the reflections and the polished surface. The rendering highlights the intricate design details typically found in mechanical components.",
