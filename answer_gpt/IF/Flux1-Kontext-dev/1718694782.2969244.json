      "question": "Is the edited image divided into two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is clear that there are two separate sections side by side, each depicting a different scene and mood. This is a common layout used in comics and graphic novels to show the progression of a storyline. Therefore, based on the visualization, it can be concluded that the image is divided into two distinct panels.",

      "question": "Does Panel 1 show the character standing at the edge of a mountain cliff, preparing to jump?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, the character is depicted in a jumping pose facing forward, with their body angled as if in mid-motion rather than standing. This suggests that the character is not standing preparing to jump but appears to be actively jumping already. The position of the character does not convey a stationary stance at the edge of a cliff.",

    {

      "question": "Are motion lines present in Panel 1 to emphasize the action of jumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, around the character, there are dynamic lines radiating outward. These lines are stylistically used in comics to suggest movement or emphasis on an actionâ€”in this case, jumping. Therefore, the presence of motion lines can be inferred.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, there is a text contained within a text balloon that has a speech bubble appearance. It states 'The jump of a lifetime awaits!' suggesting anticipation and action associated with the character shown mid-jump.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, the background features a vibrant array of colors transitioning from deep oranges to reds and yellows. This color pattern mimics the hues typically seen during a sunset or sunrise, creating a dramatic and vibrant background.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second panel of Image B, a parachute is visible above the character, with lines suggesting it is being deployed. This is a clear indication that a parachute is involved in the action of the panel, confirming the presence of a parachute above the character.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second panel of Image B, there is a text within a speech balloon stating 'Soaring sky high!'. This fits the context of the parachute scene where the character may feel as if they are flying, confirming the presence of such a speech bubble.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the background consists mainly of a clear sky with a few cloud representations. However, these clouds do not contain exaggerated or particularly stylized features that make visual excitement apparent. Therefore, these clouds, while present, do not significantly enhance visual excitement.",
