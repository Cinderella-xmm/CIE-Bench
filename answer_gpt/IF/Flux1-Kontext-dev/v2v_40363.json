        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork appears to be composed of bricks or painted blocks rather than small mosaic tiles. Although the image has textured surfaces, it does not exhibit the characteristics of mosaic tiles, such as smaller individual tiles and visible grout lines.",

The composition and arrangement maintain the integrity of the original design.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not appear to reflect the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles. The surface resembles painted bricks or blocks rather than the glossy or matte finish typical of mosaic tiles. The finish and texture do not indicate the presence of ceramic materials.",
