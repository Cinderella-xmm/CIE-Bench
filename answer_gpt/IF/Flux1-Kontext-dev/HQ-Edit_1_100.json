    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible calendar layout element (such as a date, month, or decorative border) indicating the image is formatted as an art calendar page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style and framing around the image give the impression of an art illustration. There is a decorative border that is characteristic of how some art calendar pages are framed, but without specific date or month indicators. The presence of such a border often serves to enhance focus on the art and could imply a calendar-style layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure exhibit characteristics of a half-cartoon style, such as stylized facial features, smooth lines, or exaggerated proportions while maintaining realism in other areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted with simple lines, flat colors, and exaggerated features—hallmarks of a cartoon style. The proportions like the large, rounded buttons and the smoothness in the lines contribute to this half-cartoon style while the setting retains more realistic elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book in the foreground visibly longer than a normal book, with an elongated shape that exceeds typical proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the book do not appear exaggerated or elongated beyond typical dimensions. It is drawn in line with standard book proportions commonly found in illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sleeves display soft, flowing drapery with visible folds and gentle curvature, suggesting fabric texture and movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves are depicted with large, rounded curves and lines that give the sense of drapery and movement. The illustration style captures these soft and flowing qualities more abstractly.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons are simple and solid-colored, mainly blue and lack any detailed filigree or ornate designs. They are stylistically consistent with a more simplified and cartoonish approach rather than intricate realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are the library shelves stylized or positioned to form a wooden frame around the central figure and scene, creating a framed composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelves are drawn in perspective that appear to form part of the border of the composition. This creates a visual framework that encapsulates the central figure, reminiscent of a traditional picture frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are visual elements such as warm lighting, aged books, wooden surfaces, and focused reading posture present to enhance the scholarly atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the cartoon style, elements like the aged books and the setting do suggest an academic environment. However, due to the simplicity of the illustration, the warm lighting and detailed wood textures may not be as prominently depicted as in a more realistic setting.",
