      "question": "Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the space where the timer used to be, now occupied by a blurred section over what appears to be an illustration of some kind. While the actual illustration is blurred, the context suggests it could be a replacement illustration for the timer. A robotic dog is metaphorically within the realm of possibility, but the blurring prevents exact identification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robotic dog clearly shown holding a coin in its paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurred section prevents clear identification of any specific characteristics such as what the figure is holding. Common sense and visual analysis together suggest that the illustration, if not blurred, could show details like holding a coin, but they are not clearly visible.",

      "question": "Does the parking meter still display billing information such as numbers and labels in a legible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, key components like the upper display with numbers and labels remain visible and legible. Despite the blurred section elsewhere, these sections provide billing information similar to Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall shape and structure of the parking meter remained consistent with the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comparison between Image A and Image B shows consistency in the parking meter's overall shape and structure. The meter retains its cylindrical top, color, and general build, indicating no change despite the alteration in what might be displayed within the blurred section.",

      "question": "Is the robotic dog designed with features such as metallic textures or mechanical parts, making it identifiable as a robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not allow for detailed observation of textures or mechanical details due to the blurring. The assertion that it has robotic features cannot be confirmed without visual evidence from the image.",
