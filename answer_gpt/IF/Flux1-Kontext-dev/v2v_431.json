      "question": "Are the keys depicted in a 3D cartoon-style chibi rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys exhibit a 3D appearance with bold, simplified lines and vibrant colors typical of a cartoon or chibi style. The rounded and exaggerated features, combined with the bright red and yellow color scheme, enhance the playful and stylized look characteristic of chibi art. This differs from more realistic or detailed depictions, indicating a deliberate choice to portray the keys in a cartoon-like manner.",

      "question": "Have red and gold hues been used in the patterns and details of the keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all keys are predominantly depicted in red, with some yellow, which resembles gold, as accent colors. The use of vibrant red and yellow hues is noticeable throughout the image and aligns with the question’s reference to red and gold tones, often seen in playful, stylized designs emphasizing contrast and liveliness.",

      "question": "Does the texture of the keys resemble polished, ornamental accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys have a smooth, shiny appearance with bright red and yellow colors and a cartoonish style. The polished look, along with the decorative elements, gives the impression of ornamental accessories. They lack realistic textures found in metals, offering a glossy and stylized appearance instead, fitting ornamental accessory depictions.",

      "question": "Is the backdrop featuring a subtle \"囍\" paper-cut design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the background features a consistent color scheme with embellishments, but there is no specific indication of a '囍' paper-cut design. The included decorative floral and abstract shapes do not closely resemble the traditional double happiness symbol, suggesting the design elements are not specifically '囍' paper-cuts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the original keys display unique shapes and intricate symbols. Image B retains these key shapes and symbols, though they are stylized in a 3D cartoon manner. The shift to a chibi style maintains the overall design elements while altering the texture and color. Despite the change in style, the fundamental designs, including the patterns and shapes, remain recognizable.",
