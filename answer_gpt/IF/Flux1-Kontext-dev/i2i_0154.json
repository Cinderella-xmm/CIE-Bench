      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is a collage consisting of four different viewpoints of the sports car. One of the viewpoints distinctly shows the front of the sports car, as evidenced by the visible headlights, grille, and front bumper. A sports car's front view is recognizable through these components, combined with knowledge of typical design features of such cars. Therefore, the edited image clearly contains the front view.",

      "question": "Does the edited image contain the side view of the sports car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image (Image B), the collage provides different angles of the sports car, but none specifically show a complete side view where the entire lateral aspect of the car is visible. Knowledge of what constitutes a side view implies seeing the whole side of the car, including doors. In Image B, the views are primarily focused on front and rear angles, along with some angled shots that do not qualify as side views. Thus, according to these observations, the side view is not present.",

      "question": "Does the edited image contain the top view of the sports car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In evaluating Image B, none of the presented images show the car from a directly overhead perspective. A top view would generally show the roof and upper surfaces clearly. Knowledge of the typical visual appearance of a top view clarifies that the angles shown—front, rear, and some angled perspectives—do not suffice for a top view representation. Hence, the edited image does not contain a top view.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the front, side, and top views visibly combined into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is composed of different views of the sports car laid out in separate panels, displaying front and rear perspectives along with some angled shots, but not a complete side or top view. World knowledge combined with visual analysis confirms that a single image with combined front, side, and top views would likely feature these perspectives layered or aligned together, not separately. Thus, they are not visibly combined into a single image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the combined image clear, appropriately scaled, and presented professionally for the specified uses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B), while not a combination of front, side, and top views, is nevertheless a clear and professionally presented collage showcasing different angles of the sports car. The resolution and angles are well captured, ensuring clarity and understanding of the car's design features, satisfying criteria typical for professional automotive presentations, such as marketing material or catalog entries. Therefore, the answer focuses not on view combination but on the quality and presentation of the image.",
