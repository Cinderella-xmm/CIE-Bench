    "Question": "Q3: Do all stickers maintain a square, 1:1 aspect ratio?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, all stickers have a similar rounded silhouette that does not form a perfect square. The character and elements depicted in the stickers slightly extend outside the central focal area, leading to a rounded shape more akin to a circle or rounded square rather than a strict square, hence not maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio.",
