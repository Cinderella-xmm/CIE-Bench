      "question": "Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange appears to be a natural fruit rather than a rubber keychain. This is evident from the texture and shine resembling that of an actual orange, with a natural-looking stem and skin. My reasoning is supported by the realistic and detailed representation of the fruit, which lacks visual indicators typical of a synthetic or rubber keychain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stem is clearly visible on the orange depicted in Image B. As the object is analyzed as a natural fruit, the stem appears very lifelike and consistent with the original orange’s characteristics. The lack of modification indicates that it retains the original stem.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glossy texture observed on the orange in Image B is very reminiscent of a natural orange's shine, indicating a high level of freshness. Glossiness is associated with a natural fruit surface rather than a rubber material used in keychains. Image A also exhibits a similar sheen, affirming Image B’s consistency in maintaining this texture.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the keychain visually recognizable as a citrus fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly portrays a citrus fruit, as evidenced by the characteristic round shape, orange color, detailed skin texture, and visible stem—all classic features of an orange. This aligns with common citrus fruit visual traits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain include a visible attachment point like a ring or clip for keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible attachment point like a ring or clip typically associated with keychains in Image B. The image presents only a plain orange without any additional components that would indicate it's modified for keychain use.",
