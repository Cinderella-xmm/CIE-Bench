      "question": "Does the smartphone screen display a sci-fi mission control interface instead of financial charts and stock data?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone screen displays graphical elements like charts, similar to data or monitoring interfaces commonly seen in sci-fi media. These elements are stylized with glowing blue accents, offering a futuristic look, which is typical of a sci-fi mission control interface. Image A's display, by contrast, shows traditional financial charts and data. The clear thematic shift in Image B aligns with a sci-fi mission control theme.",

      "question": "Are blue accents still prominently featured in the smartphone and laptop displays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features blue accents on both the smartphone and laptop displays, which is evident through the glowing blue lines, chart depictions, and interface highlights, contributing to a modern, tech-forward aesthetic. In Image A, blue is also prevalent in the data visualization, maintaining a thematic consistency. Therefore, blue remains a dominant color in both images, aligning with high-tech presentations.",

      "question": "Are there visible holographic widgets or floating 3D elements on the smartphone screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, holographic elements can be seen extending from the smartphone, such as glowing icons, which appear as if they are floating above or beyond the screen, indicative of advanced holographic technology. This effect is absent in Image A, where the display is flat and confined to the screen. The inclusion of these elements in Image B suggests a futuristic concept.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the smartphone screen appear to project forward, creating a sense of depth or holographic extension beyond the device?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays elements that appear to extend beyond the flat surface of the smartphone, as seen with the 3D holographic icons and projections around the device. This creates a perceived depth, typical of holographic technology. In Image A, the display is limited to the screen's flat surface, without any projection effect. The visual setup in Image B aligns with holographic extensions commonly depicted in sci-fi media.",

      "question": "Is there a visible biometric scanning overlay on the hand holding the smartphone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are futuristic elements included, such as holographic projections, there is no visible indication of a biometric scanning overlay targeting the hand itself. The focus seems to be on the visuals extending from the smartphone. The absence of any scanning pattern or textural difference over the hand in Image B confirms this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the laptop screen now display a panoramic view of a futuristic cityscape instead of financial charts and world maps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the presentation of digital interfaces involving data and charts on the laptop screen, similarly styled with futuristic elements. There is no transition to a panoramic cityscape view. The presence of graphs and charts, even with their advanced styling, indicates no shift to landscape imagery such as a cityscape.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the laptopâ€™s futuristic skyline display feature sharp, clear, and highly detailed graphics with no visible pixelation or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not feature a skyline view or any cityscape but retains a data interface presentation, the question isn't directly applicable. However, the graphics present, being highlighted with neon glows and detailed line work, display clarity and detail appropriate for such interfaces. There is no visible pixelation or blur in the designed elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both devices employ a consistent technological theme characterized by neon blue tones, holographic features, and intricate data visualization. The sci-fi aesthetic prevails across both screens, unifying the interface style and thematic presentation. Image A shows more classical data screens, while Image B distinctly transitions to a futuristic, unified theme.",
