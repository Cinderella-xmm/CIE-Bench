      "question": "Have the vegetables and knife been broken down into geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables and knife are depicted using distinct geometric shapes. The vegetables are rendered in block-like forms, which are common visual cues for geometric abstraction. This stylization reflects an intentional alteration to create a more structured and simplified representation compared to realistic depictions.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of geometric shapes in Image B maintains the general organization of vegetables and the knife as seen in realistic settings. However, they are stylized in an abstract, simplified form and do not appear to be rearranged in a manner that deviates from their expected positioning. Thus, while abstracted, the shapes follow a coherent structure similar to their original setup.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the abstraction in Image B, the basic forms and colors are preserved well enough for the vegetables and knife to remain recognizable. The distinct shape and arrangement allow viewers to identify each item even in their stylized forms, reflecting that abstraction has boundaries in this depiction to maintain recognizability.",

      "question": "Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the depiction uses geometric abstraction, the color palette remains relatively vibrant and varied as opposed to the muted or minimal palettes typical of Cubist art. The colors are not drastically simplified and still provide a realistic distinction between the food items and knife.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {

      "question": "Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not demonstrate overlapping planes or multiple perspectives, which are key characteristics of Cubism. The viewpoint appears consistent across the image, rendering the objects in a coherent manner without the juxtaposed angles or shifts in perspective seen in Cubist works. Thus, it does not exhibit these characteristic features.",
