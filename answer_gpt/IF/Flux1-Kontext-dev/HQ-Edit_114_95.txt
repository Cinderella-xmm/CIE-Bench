    "Question": "Q1: Has the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a bottle-shaped object?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure resembles both a bottle and the Eiffel Tower. The shape is elongated, similar to a bottle, especially with the cap-like top, indicating that the Eiffel Tower has been visually merged with a bottle shape to create a bottle-like appearance.",

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the structure have a transparent or glass-like appearance with embossed lattice patterns resembling the Eiffel Tower's framework?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure appears to have a glass-like transparency, allowing the background to be visible through it. The surface has embossed patterns that mimic the lattice work typical of the Eiffel Tower, giving the appearance of a glass bottle while retaining the Eiffel Tower's characteristic design.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a gold-colored, metallic-looking base supporting the bottle?",
