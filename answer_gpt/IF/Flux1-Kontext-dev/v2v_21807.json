        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, based on the visual cues, the outlines of the clock tower, cars, trees, and clouds are bold and pronounced. They are well-defined, making the image more illustrative and cartoon-like. This is achieved through thick and uniform lines, common in graphic design for a simplified and strong visual impact.",

This combination is characteristic of lively and engaging cartoon aesthetics.",
