      "question": "Has the reflection in the mirror been replaced with a nighttime city skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the reflection shows a nighttime city skyline with tall buildings, including one with a prominent pink light at the top, indicating a cityscape view. This contrasts with the typical use of mirrors for reflection, revealing that the surface has been altered from its assumed reflective function. Thus, the reflection has been replaced with a city skyline image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the new reflection in the mirror enhance visual depth compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror displays a city skyline, introducing a sense of vast space extending from the skyline's perspective. In Image A, the mirror simply reflects the wall, offering minimal depth. Comparatively, Image B creates a greater illusion of depth due to the distant and expansive cityscape visible in the mirror.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mirror's position and frame identical to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "After analyzing both Image A and Image B, the position and frame of the mirror appear consistent across the images. The mirror's location on the wall, along with the copper frame surrounding it, remain unchanged, indicating no alterations in these attributes between the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the new reflection include elements indicative of a nighttime setting, such as a dark sky and lit buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a reflection of a city skyline with a deep blue sky and illuminated windows, indicating a nighttime setting. The pink light atop one building suggests the presence of lights commonly seen during night hours, reiterating the nighttime environment depicted in the reflection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the sink, countertop, and accessories remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The comparison between Image A and Image B reveals that the sink, countertop, and accessories, such as the soap dispenser, faucet, and jar with branches, are in the same positions and share the same appearance across both images. This suggests no modifications were made to these elements in Image B relative to Image A.",
