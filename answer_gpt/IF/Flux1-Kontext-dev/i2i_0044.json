      "question": "Is the sandwich depicted in a thick-painted cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is represented with bold outlines and simplified colors, typical of a cartoon style. This artistic choice often employs exaggerated features and lacks the fine details present in realistic depictions, making it visually distinct and stylized.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich cross-section clearly emphasized with distinct textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a more simplified representation with less emphasis on texture. The cartoon style uses solid colors and bold outlines rather than distinct textures, making details within layers less pronounced.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the lettuce been simplified into smeared green shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce appears as large, uniform green blobs without detailed textures. This suggests a simplification often seen in cartoon art styles where intricate textures are replaced with basic shapes and colors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are red circular shapes around the plate which resemble sauce. In cartoon art, these are commonly depicted as simple, rounded shapes representing decorative elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Modern Western restaurant menus often feature realistic, high-quality images of food to appeal to customers. The cartoon style in Image B, with its bold lines and flat colors, is not typical for a mainstream restaurant menu which usually prefers realistic imagery.",
