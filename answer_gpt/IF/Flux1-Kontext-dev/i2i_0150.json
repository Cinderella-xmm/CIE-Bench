      "question": "Has the forest background been replaced with a city balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear view of a yellow bird perched on what appears to be a balcony railing. Behind this bird is a cityscape with tall buildings, which is consistent with a city environment. This differs significantly from the natural forest setting typically characterized by trees and foliage, indicating that the background has indeed been changed from a forest to a city balcony railing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird positioned on the sunlit balcony as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is seen perched on a railing, with sunlight casting on its yellow feathers, suggesting that it is on a sunlit balcony. The lighting conditions, with direct sunlight making the bird appear bright and luminous, support the setting of a sunlit balcony.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a blurred city skyline visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background contains tall buildings typical of a city skyline. These buildings are out of focus compared to the sharply focused bird in the foreground, fitting the description of a blurred city skyline providing a depth of field effect that gives prominence to the bird.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird maintain its original position relative to the new balcony railing background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the bird remains centrally positioned as the main subject along the horizontal plane, currently on the railing in Image B. Although the backgrounds differ, the bird's relative position concerning this new foreground railing matches the prominence it had with the tree branch in the original setting.",

      "question": "Does the overall lighting of the image match the sunlit balcony setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is brightly lit, with strong lighting on its surface, creating vivid highlights on its feathers. This illumination is consistent with being under direct sunlight, typical for an outdoor balcony setting, suggesting that the overall lighting does indeed match a sunlit balcony situation.",
