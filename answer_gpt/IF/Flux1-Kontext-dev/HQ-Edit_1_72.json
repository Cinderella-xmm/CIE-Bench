      "question": "Is the image rendered in a mural-like artistic style with flat colors, symbolic patterns, and a non-photorealistic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic style used is indeed reminiscent of a mural, characterized by flat colors and symbolic patterns rather than realistic detailing. The crisp lines, bold use of colors, and non-photorealistic details contribute to this aesthetic. Comparing Image A, it also follows a similar mural-like style supporting this observation.",
