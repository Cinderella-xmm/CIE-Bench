      "question": "Does the image exhibit a hand-sculpted claymation style with visible textures and a three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the character exhibits a smooth, almost glossy appearance with well-defined shapes and curves that suggest a stylized, three-dimensional effect. This aligns with the hand-sculpted claymation look, which is characterized by exaggerated forms and distinct textures that give depth and tangibility to the subject. This effect is visible in the character’s clothing, pose, and the plastic-like finish, which is typical in claymation depictions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes on the character's costume clearly defined and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the stripes on the character's costume are depicted as stark, high-contrast lines against the lighter background. In claymation, such emphasis is typical for exaggerating features to stand out, which is what we observe in Image B. Compared to Image A, where the texture is more natural and fabric-like, Image B enhances the clarity and definition of the stripes, reflecting an adapted claymation style.",

      "question": "Is the character's beret clearly visible and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beret appears distinctly shaped with smooth, rounded contours indicative of claymation. This style enhances the visibility and recognizability of objects by simplifying their form and exaggerating their dimensions. The beret in Image B is similarly emphasized with simple yet bold outlines, confirming that its depiction aligns with a claymation style.",

      "question": "Does the background maintain the European rooftop setting, with architectural details adapted to the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the background of Image B, the European rooftop setting remains consistent with distinctive architectural features. The edited image adapts these details into the claymation style by highlighting geometric shapes and simplifying textures, which give a more animated, constructed look typical of claymation. This approach retains the essence of the setting while conforming to the stylistic adaptations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire image, including the character and the background, consistently rendered in the hand-sculpted claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the character and background using exaggerated forms and simplified textures that are uniform across the image. The consistency is evident in the uniform glossiness and the smooth rendering of various elements—hallmarks of hand-sculpted claymation. Compared to Image A, which features natural textures, Image B applies a universal stylized effect emphasizing plastic-like consistency throughout the scene.",
