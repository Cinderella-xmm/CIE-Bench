    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D-rendered collectible figurine depict a chibi-style man ascending a small wooden ladder?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be in a 3D-rendered style, suggesting a move away from realistic human depiction to something more stylized. A 'chibi' style typically features exaggerated, cute proportions such as a larger head and smaller body parts. The man is not depicted in this manner but rather in a realistic, proportionate way. The ladder he ascends is similarly in realistic proportions, rather than smaller or cartoonish. Based on this observation, the term 'chibi' isn't appropriate for the style in Image B.",
