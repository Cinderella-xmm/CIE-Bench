      "question": "Has the giraffe been turned into an adorable collection of Russian nesting dolls with a chibi giraffe theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a set of Russian nesting dolls featuring a giraffe pattern. The largest doll, in particular, has distinctive giraffe features—such as a long neck and giraffe horns—which align with the visual theme of a giraffe rendered in the chibi style. This pattern and style suggest that the giraffe from Image A has been reimagined as a series of nesting dolls with a giraffe-themed design.",

      "question": "Are there exactly five nesting dolls arranged in descending sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, six nesting dolls are clearly visible, each one smaller than the previous, forming a consecutive descending arrangement in size. This setup diverges from the claim of there being exactly five, indicating a total count of six instead.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged neatly on a classy wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are organized in a row on a wooden table. The table has a polished and smooth surface, which might be perceived as classy. The arrangement of the dolls shows clear spacing and alignment, which can be described as neat.",

      "question": "Does the edited image have a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aspect ratio of an image is determined by comparing its width to its height. Observing Image B and estimating its dimensions, the width appears greater than the height. However, there are no specific indicators within the image confirming a precise 3:2 ratio. Without exact pixel measurements, we can only hypothesize based on the visible proportions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls exhibit characteristics typical of the chibi style—large heads relative to their body size, simplified facial features, and a generally exaggerated cute appearance. This style is consistent throughout the collection of dolls.",
