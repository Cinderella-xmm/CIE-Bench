    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image now depicting a box-like structure instead of a wall clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a watch contained within a box-like structure that opens to reveal its interior, which contrasts with Image A, where the clock is mounted directly on the wall. The presence of the lid, hinge, and internal lining in Image B indicate a box-like structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the outer packaging feature rich mahogany-colored wood with baroque-style ornamentation similar to the original clock frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a box with a rich mahogany-colored finish identifiable by the deep brown hues. While there is ornamentation visible in the form of a decorative brass latch, it lacks the extensive baroque-style ornamentation found in Image A, which includes elaborate scrollwork and embellishments around the clock.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a modern watch visible inside the packaging with a face featuring Roman numerals and a distressed gold finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a watch inside the box with a face prominently displaying Roman numerals and a finish that has a distressed appearance similar to the clock face in Image A. The presence of the strap and smaller size of the timepiece suggest it is a modern watch.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the interior of the packaging lined with a velvety material that has an embossed brand logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the interior of the packaging appears padded, giving the appearance of a velvety texture. Above the watch, there's a logo clearly embossed into the fabric lining, making it distinct from the wall texture in Image A which has no such feature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal engraved plaque located beneath the watch inside the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the watch sits a plaque bearing engraved text and decoration. This is a distinct alteration from Image A, which has no such plaque beneath the clock but instead shows the wall surface.",
