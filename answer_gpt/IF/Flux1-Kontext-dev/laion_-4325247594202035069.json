      "question": "Are the four figures transformed into fish-shaped forms with visible fins and tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures retain their original humanoid forms with armored and warrior-like features. They do not appear to have any features resembling fish forms such as fins or tails. The edited image showcases vibrant patterns but does not indicate any transformation to fish shapes. World knowledge suggests that fish transformations would involve clear aquatic features which are absent in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the figures appear to be made of soft fabric instead of rigid plastic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents figures with bright and textured surfaces, suggesting a potential change in material appearance. Although the colors may imply a softer fabric due to their patterns and texture variations, the edited surface treatment could be visual embellishment. Without direct tactile information, the visual data isn't definitive evidence of material change. World knowledge of fabric toys would suggest pronounced softness, which isn't distinctly observable here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the figures covered in vibrant patterns using blue, green, red, and yellow colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B indeed show vibrant patterns with colors such as blue, green, red, and yellow overtaking their surfaces, transforming their color scheme significantly from the original. The uniform brown color of Image A is replaced by diverse patterns in Image B. This conclusion is reached by analyzing the visible color variation on the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fins and tails of the fish figures exaggerated in size and shape compared to the original warrior limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Initially in Image B, there are no signs of transformation into fish figures, so fins and tails are not applicable. The shapes in Image B maintain their warrior-like form from Image A, without any exaggerated fish-like additions such as fins or tails. World knowledge of fish anatomy highlights distinct parts not observed here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the plush figures arranged on a sandy-textured fabric surface that resembles an underwater scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B appears to be a plain beige surface, not definitively resembling sandy texture or underwater scenery from common underwater imagery. Knowledge of underwater scenes usually involves water-like hues or elements, which aren't present in Image B; therefore, the arrangement doesn't suggest an underwater context.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the fish-shaped plush toys retain the dynamic, action-oriented poses of the original warrior figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows retained dynamic poses, they are consistent with warrior stances retaining humanoid characteristics. Given previously noted absence of fish transformations, Image B retains the original action-oriented poses from the unmorphed figures in Image A. Analyzing the consistent posture and position between images indicates pose continuity.",
