        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a top-down view of the sink structure, which is the visual presentation of the sink as seen from above, showing elements like the faucet and the basin.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there is an angled side view of the sink structure, offering a perspective that shows the elevation and dimensions of the sink and faucet from an angle, which displays the shape and structure distinctively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top-down view and the angled side view merged into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents both the top-down view and the angled side view within a single image layout. Although they are separate representations, they are displayed together in the same image. This common approach in architectural drafting ensures clarity in understanding the structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is arranged clearly with separate sections for the top-down and angled side views, allowing viewers to comprehend the different angles of the sink structure easily. This clear organization is typical in technical illustrations to avoid confusion.",

      "question": "Do both the top-down view and the angled side view accurately depict the sink structure seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing with the original image (Image A), the edited image (Image B) effectively translates the sinkâ€™s structure into a top-down and an angled view. The features such as faucets and the sink outline match the original image, ensuring an accurate technical depiction.",
