      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation, the inside of the box in Image B contains a dark lining that appears plush, typical of velvet or a similar luxurious material.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid of the box showcases gold decorative elements.

      "explanation": "Image B shows the key resting on a light, smooth fabric within the box, resembling satin, which is a common choice for elegant displays due to its sheen and softness. This material helps emphasize the luxury and beauty of the item held, indicating a satin-like compartment.",
