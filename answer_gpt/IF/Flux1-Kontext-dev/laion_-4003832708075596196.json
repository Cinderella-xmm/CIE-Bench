    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the tree trunk been reshaped into distinct arm and leg forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunk retains its shape similar to a typical tree trunk without distinct arm and leg forms. It does not have any appendages that resemble arms or legs. Thus, the answer is derived from visual inspection of the tree form in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements positioned as heads with cartoonish facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no leaf-shaped elements that are positioned as heads with cartoonish facial features. The heads are not leaves; they are cartoon characters with hats and clothes standing next to the tree. This is inferred by identifying the anthropomorphic characters separately from the leaves in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leaf faces display visible cartoonish facial expressions (e.g., eyes, mouth, eyebrows)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaves in Image B do not have facial expressions. While the anthropomorphic characters exhibit clear facial expressions, the leaves remain plain without any added facial features such as eyes or mouths.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are hats and scarves present on the anthropomorphic tree characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two anthropomorphic characters next to the tree, each wearing a hat. One of the characters also wears a scarf. This is observed through the visual details of the characters near the tree.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there text bubbles with Thanksgiving greetings placed around the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are text bubbles present, but they do not contain recognizably legible English Thanksgiving greetings. The text appears to be nonsensical or in a decorative font, not explicitly conveying a Thanksgiving message as per usual standards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire illustration, including characters and text bubbles, contained within the original border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B keeps the entirety of the illustration, with added elements like characters and text bubbles, confined within the main border that also contains the tree and leaves. The elements do not extend beyond the main rectangular border.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all colors used in the illustration consistent with the autumn palette (orange, yellow, red, brown)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to use an autumn palette consistently across the illustration, with visible colors like orange, yellow, red, and brown dominating the design. This can be determined by the shades used in the tree, leaves, and character clothing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the text \"Happy Thanksgiving\" still visible below the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Happy Thanksgiving' is no longer visible below the tree illustration. The text is replaced by other textual elements or symbols and is not present in its original form.",
