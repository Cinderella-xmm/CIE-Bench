      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building elements such as rooflines and window frames exhibit sharp and angular edges, which are common characteristics of a paper-cut art style. Paper-cut art often involves clean geometric shapes and precise edges to simulate the look of cut paper. This analysis is rooted in the observation of the architectural features and their stylized representation.",

      "question": "Are the window frames and plant motifs enhanced with visible gold foil-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no indication of gold foil-like accents on the window frames or plant motifs. Such enhancements would typically reflect light or have a metallic gleam, which is absent here. The window frames and plant motifs appear to be rendered without special highlights or shimmering effects that resemble gold foil.",

      "question": "Is the entrance awning colored in a bold crimson hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entrance awning is indeed a bold crimson hue. The use of bold, saturated colors can distinctly color the awning in its representation, which contrasts with the surrounding neutral-toned architecture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a background with a textured look, resembling cream-colored paper. Such a textured appearance is common in artistic renditions that mimic traditional paper materials, emphasizing the vintage postcard aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, none of the postcards show a geometric arch border surrounding them. The borders appear to be straight and rectangular, which is typical for postcard presentations.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually presents postcards within thin visible borders, typical of postcard arrangements. They are not borderless as there is a distinct white margin outlining each postcard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three separate postcards. Each one shows slight variations of the hotel, such as differences in the color of the awning, capturing the same location from similar angles but with contrasts.",
