      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the laundromat and the person holding laundry, depicted using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements within the scene, like the bricks on the wall, the clothes, and the features of the character, appear blocky and glossy, typical of Lego material. This blocky aesthetic suggests a constructed look that aligns with Lego bricks. Such elements lend a toy-like appearance where individuals and objects in the environment are represented as Lego pieces.",

      "question": "Are the person and the folded laundry represented as Lego figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the character holding the laundry has a toy-like appearance, with smooth, non-detailed features akin to those found in Lego mini-figures. Additionally, the laundry appears as rounded rectangular shapes, characteristic of Lego objects. These visual cues indicate that in Image B, both the person and the laundry resemble the stylized and simplistic forms of Lego figures and objects.",

      "question": "Is the laundromat environment, including the walls, doors, and washing machines, constructed using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment—including the walls appear uniformly textured with a consistent pattern seen in Lego pieces. The doors and washing machines have a stylized and simplified representation fitting Lego aesthetics. Such details imply that the laundromat components utilize the blocky template typical in Lego constructions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the scene have a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a scene where each element—be it the character, the laundry, or the surrounding structures—exudes a uniformity and rigidity typical of stop-motion setups. The uniform proportions and absence of naturalistic textures suggest a constructed environment, synonymous with dioramas used in stop-motion animation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the overall scene composition been maintained while adapting it to the Lego aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition, including the positioning of the person holding the laundry in front of the laundromat, is preserved from Image A, with differences solely in material using Lego aesthetics. The core elements, such as the building layout, character posture, and color scheme, are held constant despite the change to a Lego format.",
