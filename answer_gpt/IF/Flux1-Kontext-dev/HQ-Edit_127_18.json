      "question": "Is the entire elephant and savannah scene enclosed within a visible vintage travel case structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene containing the elephant, savannah grass, and trees is enclosed within a structure that looks like a case. The presence of a latch and hinges supports the interpretation that it is a vintage travel case. The enclosure also has a wooden appearance characteristic of an old-fashioned case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant and landscape elements appear as detailed miniature 3D models with realistic scaling and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant and landscape elements with a three-dimensional appearance. They are detailed and appear to be scaled to fit within the case. The depth and realistic features, such as the texture of the elephant's skin and the appearance of the plants, suggest these are designed to be miniature models creating a sense of depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ground covered with a material that resembles grass but has a textured, resin-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material on the ground around the elephant does resemble grass in structure but lacks the natural variance and complexity of real grass. It appears uniform and has a sheen consistent with resin or a synthetic material used in model making, giving it a stylized effect rather than a natural look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small-scale acacia tree placed in the diorama to indicate scale balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the scene in Image B, there are small trees that resemble acacia trees. These are used to maintain a sense of scale proportion between the elephant and other scene components. Their small size compared to the elephant emphasizes the miniature nature of the model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky depicted as painted elements on the inner surface of a backdrop lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky and clouds are part of the background that looks like it is painted onto the inner surface of a lid-like structure of the case. This backdrop creates the illusion of a painted diorama, common in such model displays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a brass-colored compass placed on the base of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the diorama in Image B, there is a circular metal feature that resembles a compass due to its design and a needle-like hand pointing to numbers, consistent with the appearance of a brass-colored compass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
