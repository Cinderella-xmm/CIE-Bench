However, the presence of hibiscus flowers is limited to decorative elements around the characters and not extensively in the background itself.

    "Question": "Q5: Are the stickers designed with a dimension ratio of 9:16?",
    "explanation": "The 9:16 ratio is a vertical format often used for smartphone screens; in Image B, the layout of the stickers, which appear side-by-side in a more square format, doesnâ€™t seem to adhere to a 9:16 ratio. Each individual sticker appears more square-like rather than elongated vertically, indicating that they do not fit this particular dimension ratio commonly associated with vertical-oriented media.",
    "answer": "No"
