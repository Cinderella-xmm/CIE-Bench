      "question": "Are all structural elements of the Japanese house rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black lead lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structural elements of the house are distinctly outlined with thick black lines, similar to the boundaries found in stained glass designs. This includes the roof, windows, and overall architectural features. The coloring within these sections appears uniformly distributed, resembling stained glass panels that are often encased by black lead lines to separate them and define the structure. Such visual cues indicate that the house is rendered to mimic the look of stained glass. Comparing this to Image A, the architectural elements are realistic without such distinct outlines, confirming the transformation in Image B to a stained glass style.",

      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized floral motifs made of red and green segmented glass pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the red trees as delineated components with thick black outlines and sections filled in with bold, consistent colors resembling stained glass segments. These sections could be interpreted as stylized floral motifs, a common design element in stained glass art where colors are separated by black lines to create distinct shapes. In comparison, Image A shows realistic trees with shaded leaves and branches, indicating that Image B uses completed segments to represent the trees differently.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the large red moon rendered using multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is depicted with strong, singular colors without visible overlapping or gradient transitions in its rings. The visual style aligns more with solid blocks of color separated by black lines typical in stained glass, rather than gradient or layered effects. This differs from Image A, where realistic shading would be more prominent in depicting a natural lunar surface, confirming no gradient technique is used in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all major elements (house, trees, moon) clearly outlined with thick, black, continuous lines resembling lead came in stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows all major elements, including the house, trees, and moon, with conspicuous black outlines, resembling the use of lead came in stained glass art. These outlines define the boundaries of each color segment within the image, providing clear separation between different parts of the composition, a signature technique in stained glass art for structural clarity. Image A lacks these thick, continuous outlines, illustrating the transformation applied to Image B to achieve a stained glass appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene maintain the original composition (house centered, trees flanking, moon above, water in foreground) while all elements are styled as stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B preserves the composition seen in Image A: the house remains centered in the frame, the trees flank its sides, the moon is positioned above, and water reflects the scene in the foreground. This layout is maintained while transforming the stylistic representation into stained glass. By contrast, Image A shows a realistic approach, indicating that Image B's composition isn’t altered but styled differently.",
