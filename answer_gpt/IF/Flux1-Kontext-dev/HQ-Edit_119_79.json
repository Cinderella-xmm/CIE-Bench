    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire cat composed of crystal materials with no visible fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parts of the cat that are visible beneath the blurred region appear to be made of highly reflective, transparent materials similar to crystal, indicating a crystalline construction rather than fur. The visible paws and parts of the body show no fur, instead having a faceted, glass-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body parts of the cat constructed primarily from clear and smoky quartz crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible parts of the cat are transparent and clear, resembling crystal materials. However, without specific smoky tones, it's unclear if smoky quartz is used; the material appears more like a generic clear crystal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are brown and black obsidian accents used to represent the calico pattern on the cat’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The calico pattern is represented using opaque colored sections in the lower body, but these areas do not have a distinct glossy or stone-like quality that suggests obsidian is used. They appear as color patterns within the crystalline structure rather than distinct materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cat’s eyes crafted from vibrant green emerald crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are obscured by the blurred area, making it impossible to determine the materials used for the eyes based on the visible elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cat seated on a plain, polished wooden block with no added decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is seated on a wooden block that is adorned with decorative elements such as green ivy leaves, indicating that it is not plain without added decorations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the wooden block appear natural and polished, providing a clear contrast to the crystalline cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden block is seen as a constructed pedestal with a polished appearance. This provides a noticeable contrast to the faceted, clear materials of the crystalline cat, offering both visual and textural contrast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the cat maintained its original seated posture with paws forward and tail curved behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the face being obscured, the visible parts of the cat still show a similar posture with paws positioned forward and the tail wrapped around, maintaining the original seated posture seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
