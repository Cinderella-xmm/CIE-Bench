      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a dynamic pose with its entire upper body visible, along with legs. The character is in a jumping posture, with both factors suggesting a full-body representation rather than a restricted upper-half portrayal. Therefore, concluding from visual cues and understanding of body forms, the character is shown in full-body form.",

      "question": "Does the character appear to be jumping out of a children’s tablet screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu is depicted in a lively jumping pose above a rectangular device with a screen, which resembles a smartphone rather than a tablet due to specific features like the visible button and unrounded edges. By analyzing the design and visual context, it appears more like a phone rather than a tablet, thus it is not jumping out of a children’s tablet screen.",

      "question": "Are the character's arms open in a welcoming gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu’s arms are extended outward, which can be interpreted as a welcoming gesture due to the open position and the expression of excitement on its face. The widespread arms, combined with a cheerful expression, suggest welcoming behavior based on common interpretations of body language in animations.",

      "question": "Does the overall depiction simulate an interactive entertainment effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts Pikachu in an animated jumping pose above a device, which suggests interactivity between the character and the device. This portrayal stimulates an entertainment effect by implying the character could be interacting with media content, typical in interactive digital experiences. Therefore, the portrayal simulates an interactive entertainment effect.",

      "question": "Does the tablet include features typical of children's tablets, such as rounded edges or colorful design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted device has standard features of an adult smartphone, such as the rounded corners but not exaggeratedly rounded, and a simplistic design with subdued colors. Children's tablets typically have vivid colors and pronounced rounded edges for safety and appeal. This device lacks those features; hence, it does not align with typical children's tablet design.",
