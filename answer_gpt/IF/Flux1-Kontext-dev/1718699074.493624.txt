    "Question": "Q1: Has the central structure been replaced with a digital billboard featuring luminous panels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure appears to be surrounded by luminous panels, suggesting the presence of a digital billboard with bright, neon-like features. These panels seem to emit a characteristic glow associated with digital screens or billboards, indicating a transformation from a non-digital object to a digital display.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible dynamic neon animations on the digital billboard surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the billboard displays vibrant neon colors and complex patterns that resemble the style of animated neon signs. This suggests the presence of dynamic elements, typical of animations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the natural overgrowth been replaced with synthetic, glowing foliage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage surrounding the structure glows with a bright, possibly artificial light, differing from the typical appearance of natural plants. This glowing effect implies a synthetic, designed element rather than natural growth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original architectural angles and structural geometry preserved in the transformed structure?",
    "explanation": "Despite the digital enhancements seen in Image B, the underlying structure retains its original shape and geometric angles, as evident from the comparison with Image A where the structural design remains consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the surrounding buildings feature metallic facades and visible augmented reality elements such as holograms or digital overlays?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although there is a clear emphasis on digital and neon elements around the central structure, the surrounding buildings appear not to exhibit overt metallic facades or augmented reality elements like holograms, remaining rather similar to their original form depicted in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
