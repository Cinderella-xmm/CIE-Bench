      "question": "Is the chocolate tower redesigned into a box-shaped structure resembling a festive tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate appears to be sculpted into a conical shape, which is typically associated with a festive tree, such as a Christmas tree. It does not have a box shape, as it maintains a three-dimensional, cone-like design. Based on the visual cues in Image B, the tower is indeed shaped to resemble a festive tree.",
