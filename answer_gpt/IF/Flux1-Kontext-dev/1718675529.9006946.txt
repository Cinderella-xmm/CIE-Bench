    "Question": "Q1: Is the image rendered in a stylized, graphic manner consistent with Art Deco design principles, rather than a photorealistic style?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the scene with bold, simplified shapes and a limited color palette. Art Deco design is characterized by its use of geometric patterns, clean lines, and sometimes a stylized form of realism, often omitting fine details found in photorealistic images. The stylistic choices in Image B align well with these principles, using simplified forms and a structured, graphic approach.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the ocean waves represented using bold, simplified geometric curves instead of naturalistic wave forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are drawn using smooth, curving lines that lack the detailed texture and irregular patterns of natural waves. This approach aligns with more abstract representations typically found in Art Deco and related graphic styles, where form is simplified to core lines and shapes.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the palm trees depicted as stylized vertical lines without detailed fronds or natural tree structure?",
    "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B are represented with simple vertical trunks and minimal detailing in the fronds, aligning with a stylized approach. Rather than focusing on intricate leaf patterns, the trees are reduced to essential forms, offering a more graphic look that emphasizes silhouette over detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the clouds in the sky rendered as symmetrical, geometric shapes rather than natural cloud forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are depicted as bold, rounded shapes without the fluffy, irregular outlines seen in natural clouds. This geometric simplification creates a more stylized appearance, matching the image's overall Art Deco influence. Geometric shapes often add symmetry and predictability, typical characteristics of this stylization.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the image use a color palette dominated by muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, avoiding bright or highly saturated colors?",
    "explanation": "The color palette utilized in Image B leans heavily on muted tones of blue, green, and orange. These colors are chosen to create a harmonious, cohesive scene without the jarring contrasts that might come from more saturated hues. This choice is in line with many graphic design styles that prioritize aesthetic balance.",

The ocean, sand, horizon, and sky are all represented in clear, distinct areas, maintaining the fundamental layout of a typical beach landscape while allowing for artistic interpretation.",
