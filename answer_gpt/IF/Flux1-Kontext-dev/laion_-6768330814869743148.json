      "question": "Are the pastries depicted with exaggerated, bright colors and bold outlines characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries are shown in highly saturated colors like bright reds and yellows, with bold black outlines that are typical of pop art styles. This style often employs vivid colors and defined outlines to create a cartoonish effect. Compared to common real-world depictions of pastries, these colors and outlines are exaggerated. Therefore, the depiction fits the pop art characteristic, emphasizing visual impact over natural representation.",

      "question": "Do the bread slices feature bold outlines and vivid, non-naturalistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slices are illustrated with heavy stylistic outlines and are colored in vibrant red, which is uncommon for actual bread. This is a distinct deviation from their natural appearance, which would typically involve various shades of brown. Such use of bold outlines and vivid colors is a hallmark of pop art, diverging significantly from realistic depictions.",

      "question": "Are the muffin liners replaced with distinct geometric patterns such as triangles, squares, or other regular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muffin liners are depicted with consistent patterns which do not form recognizable geometric shapes like triangles or squares. They retain some colored pattern design, but it doesnâ€™t translate into distinct geometric configurations. It seems more abstract and part of the stylized representation rather than explicit geometric patterns.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wooden trays replaced with a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trays are depicted with a pattern of white with red dots that suggests a polka dot or vintage texture rather than a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors. A checkerboard pattern typically consists of two colors alternating in square shapes. Hence, the replacement does not match the description of a checkerboard pattern.",

      "question": "Have the background cups been replaced with abstract, colorful, non-representational shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background cups are no longer visible and are replaced by a background brick wall. There are no abstract, colorful, non-representational shapes replacing them in Image B, indicating that the cups have been removed from the composition entirely without substitution.",
