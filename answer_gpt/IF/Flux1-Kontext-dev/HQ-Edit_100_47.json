    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented as a three-dimensional shadow box diorama with visible depth created by layered components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the presentation within an apparent frame that holds depth suggests it is a three-dimensional diorama. The apparent shadow box has been observed due to the way the image is inset within the frame, creating the illusion of depth which is a common feature in shadow boxes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the skyline and foreground elements visibly separated into multiple layered paper cut-out sections to simulate depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, there is an indication of depth through layering, but it's more about perceived depth created by the framing and how it holds the image. However, the skyline and foreground do not explicitly show separated layered paper cut-out sections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the grassy lawn area been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface that shows reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy lawn area remains consistent with the typical verdant appearance of the real location, and there is no indication of it having been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there numerous small, detailed, three-dimensional-looking pedestrian figures scattered throughout the scene, particularly on pathways and near the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there are indeed many small pedestrian figures visible, and while they appear detailed, there is no explicit indication of their three-dimensionality beyond the typical rendering in the illustration itself, which lacks actual depth seen in three-dimensional figures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene framed by a dark border with visible metallic edges, consistent with a shadow box enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct dark frame with metallic edges surrounding the scene, which aligns with a typical shadow box enclosure style, indicating three-dimensionality and depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are city names and geographic coordinates visibly engraved along the outer edge of the frame in fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower part of the frame in Image B contains some text or engraving, which includes what appears to be details resembling geographic coordinates or similar information, although not all words are legible. This presentation is typical for frames that add contextual or geographical details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
