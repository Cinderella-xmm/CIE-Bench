      "question": "Are the wings replaced with large, angular crystal shards in shades of opal and white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are depicted with feathers that have a crystalline appearance, showcasing shades of opal and white. The feathers appear sharp and angular, indicating a stylized design feature common in fantasy visuals. Comparing to Image A, the wings are feathered, glowing with a softer light. This observation suggests a change consistent with the description.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the shirt appears consistent with a standard fabric rather than a velvet material, suggesting a smooth, matte look as opposed to the sheen normally associated with velvet.
