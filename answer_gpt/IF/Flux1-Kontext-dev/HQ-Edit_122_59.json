      "question": "Is the elephant enclosed within a visible glass display case with ornate framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is clearly displayed within a glass case, as evidenced by the transparent walls and reflections suggesting the presence of glass. The case is framed with wood, and the wood base beneath the glass case features ornate floral designs. The reasoning is based on identifying transparent material with framing, a common method for museum and exhibit display cases.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the elephant been scaled down to a miniature size relative to the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears smaller relative to the size of nearby bonsai trees and rocks, suggesting that the sculpture is a miniature rather than life-sized. It is rather uncommon for bonsai to be large compared to an elephant, so this discrepancy in proportion indicates the elephant's scaled-down nature. This reasoning is based on common size relationships between elephants and surrounding elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible golden inlays integrated into the surface of the elephant sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant sculpture displays intricate woodwork without golden inlays. The sculpture's surface is made solely from wood with detailed carvings, which is typical for such decorative pieces rather than including golden additions. The reasoning involves identifying the material texture and color, which are characteristics of wooden sculptures without metallic components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple tiny bonsai trees positioned around the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several small bonsai trees surrounding the elephant, each with typically rounded canopies and small trunks portrayed in a miniature landscape manner. These bonsai trees are purposefully arranged around the elephant sculpture as part of the display. The assessment is based on the identification of trees with bonsai-like features, signifying deliberate positioning in the exhibit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the scene surrounding the elephant filled with a dense, miniature jungle rendered in vibrant, earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene includes a vibrant arrangement of bonsai trees and rocky formations surrounding the elephant within the glass case. However, the background doesn't evoke a dense jungle atmosphere but rather a controlled landscape with carefully positioned miniature plants. The judgment is based on interpretation of the bonsai placement and the open scenic backdrop with clouds, contrasted against dense jungle imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the base resemble a smooth, polished stone with visible engraved floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the elephant placed on what resembles a rocky base within a glass case, surrounded by bonsai trees and artificial grass, while the lower part of the structure—the case's base—features ornate floral patterns. This analysis shows the base of the case rather than a rock base below the elephant directly featuring floral engravings. The reasoning stems from recognizing the carvings on the wooden frame of the case rather than the stand itself.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all elements in the scene—glass case, bonsai, jungle, base, and elephant—harmonize in style and color to create a cohesive, elegant natural theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements within Image B work together to form a cohesive display. The use of wood tones in both the elephant sculpture and case framing, along with the earthy textures and green bonsai trees, along with the rocky elements, creates an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious exhibit that emphasizes a natural theme. This analysis combines the color palette, material choice, and arrangement within the scene to determine a unified presentation style.",
