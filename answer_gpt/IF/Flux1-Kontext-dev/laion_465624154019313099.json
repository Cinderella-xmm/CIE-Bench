        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly comprises two distinct illustrations aligned in a vertical sequence, mirroring a traditional comic layout. The bold title 'Cake Conundrum!' spans the upper section, serving as an introductory headline for the depicted comic storyline.",

        "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "In the first panel, are the cake creature’s eyes wide open, showing surprise, and is the dialogue “Who ate my delicious corner?!” present in a speech bubble?",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "In Panel 1, are there faint silhouettes of utensils (such as spoons or forks) visible in the background, suggesting a party setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the first panel in Image B does not show any faint silhouettes of utensils like spoons or forks. Instead, it exhibits silhouettes of hands reaching upwards, which commonly indicate a crowd or audience rather than a party setting with utensils.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "In Panel 2, does the cake creature appear to be shaking its head, has the dialogue “No more free bites, time for dessert defense!” been added, and are strawberries and garnishes arranged as bodyguards and a shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 displays the cake character emitting a confident, defensive stance rather than shaking its head. The speech bubble, however, states, 'No more free bites, for dessert defence!', aligning with the theme of protecting itself. The surroundings are populated with strawberries, yet they are not distinctly depicted as bodyguards or forming a shield.",
