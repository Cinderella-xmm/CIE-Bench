      "question": "Are the bookshelf and books fully constructed from LEGO bricks instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf has an appearance that suggests it is constructed from uniform rectangular shapes with consistent color, typical of LEGO bricks. This contrasts with wood, which usually has a natural grain pattern and varying forms. The visual cues of consistent, uniform shapes and the absence of wood grain lead to the conclusion that it is made from LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all books represented as individual LEGO blocks in earthy tones (e.g., brown, tan, terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the books on the shelf appear to be represented using LEGO bricks in various earthy tones such as brown, tan, and terracotta. Each book is constructed as a separate block or a combination of blocks in a similar color spectrum, characteristic of LEGO constructions. The color consistency and block-like representation confirm this.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the intricate carvings on the original shelf and book spines replicated using darker LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a simplified design without intricate carvings that appear in the original image. LEGO bricks have limitations in reflecting such intricate details due to their blocky nature, and any attempt in the image appears to be absent or extremely simplified compared to the original, which exhibits detailed carvings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the LEGO tower narrow progressively toward the top, forming a tapered shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is depicted as a tower-like bookshelf where the top narrows progressively, forming a distinct tapered shape constructed entirely from LEGO bricks. This tapered appearance is achieved by stacking bricks in a manner that gradually decreases in width towards the top.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO structure smooth and plastic-like, lacking any wood grain or natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "LEGO bricks are characterized by their smooth, plastic-like surface which is evident in Image B. The absence of any evident wood grain or natural texture confirms that the structure depicted has the artificial and smooth texture typical of LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background plain and muted, without any patterns or textures, to highlight the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be plain and features a single solid color without any patterns or textures, which serves to highlight the LEGO structure more distinctly by providing an unobtrusive backdrop.",
