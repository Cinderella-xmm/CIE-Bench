        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the word 'Sharp' is visibly placed at the top left of the image, suggesting an addition of text to the original illustration. This indicates that the word 'Sharp' has been explicitly added during the editing process to emphasize the sharpness of the scissors, a common trait in advertisements to highlight key features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Sharp' and 'Clean' in Image B appear in a sketched style, which aligns with the overall rough sketch appearance of the illustration. This stylistic choice keeps the hand-drawn, artistic theme consistent across the text and the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a professional and relevant look for an advertisement targeting hairdressing tools brands.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No\n```",
      "explanation": "Besides the addition of the words 'Sharp' and 'Clean', Image B does not display any additional elements or alterations compared to Image A. The focus lies predominantly on the text addition surrounding the scissors illustration to emphasize certain qualities of the product.",
