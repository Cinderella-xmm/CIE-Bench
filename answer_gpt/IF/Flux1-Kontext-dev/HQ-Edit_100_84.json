        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Mystic Arabian Dhow Journeys' is prominently displayed at the top of the image.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dhow boat adorned with decorative patterns along its structure, including the intricately curved designs on the hull and around the architectural embellishments of the boat.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a predominant use of rich blue tones for the sky and water, combined with golden hues seen on the sails and decorations of the boat. This combination of colors is used to create a vibrant, contrasting visual effect, enhancing the warmth of the light and the coolness of the surroundings. Such a color palette often accentuates depth and creates a dramatic landscape effect.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant sailboats are depicted with simple shapes and dark colors that contrast with the brightness of the main dhow boat.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
