      "question": "Is the McLaren depicted as a highly detailed 3D-rendered model rather than a photographic image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the McLaren appears to be a highly detailed and stylized representation within a display case. The overall appearance suggests a finely rendered model, likely in 3D, given the consistency of lighting and the lack of real-world imperfections typical of photographic images. This is inferred by the pristine and polished visual quality. In contrast, Image A shows the car in a more realistic, less stylized environment, indicative of a photographic image with natural lighting and shadows.",

      "question": "Is the McLaren enclosed within a transparent acrylic display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the McLaren is visibly enclosed in a transparent case, which can be identified by the clear sides and the reflections present, suggesting acrylic or similar material. The overall setup resembles an exhibit style typical for displaying models. Image A does not show the car within any case; it is out in the open as part of a showroom.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car rest on a polished chrome base that resembles a rotating platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the car resting on a polished base with reflective properties, which resemble chrome. This setup gives the appearance of a higher-end platform often used in displays for rotation, indicating meticulous attention to detail. Image A shows the car on a simpler showroom platform without chrome-like reflective qualities.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an interior wall with subtle carbon fiber textures, identified by the distinctive pattern associated with this material, often used to suggest sophistication and durability in product displays. There's no hint of such textures in Image A, which has plain walls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a set of mini tools, including wrenches and screwdrivers, is clearly visible and arranged inside the display case beside the car, suggesting attention to detail and a thematic link to the automotive world. No such tools are present in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a backdrop with what appears to be a laser-etched silhouette of a cityscape, which complements the urban and high-end aesthetic of the display case environment. This detail contributes to the visual theme and sophistication. Image A does not show any such cityscape; it has a plain background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B is designed with a high-end showroom aesthetic, visible through the premium materials like acrylic for the case, chrome for the base, and professional lighting that highlights the meticulous details of the setup. The presence of carbon fiber textures and laser-etched details further reinforces this impression. Image A, while showing a luxury car, lacks these additional elements and finishes characteristic of a high-end display design.",
