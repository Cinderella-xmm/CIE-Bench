      "question": "Is the overall image rendered with a glossy finish that reflects light, giving it the appearance of a high-quality art postcard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a glowing effect that enhances its artistic quality. The highlights and reflections seen in the dancer’s dress and the overall lighting suggest a polished and glossy finish, characteristic of art postcards. This reflective quality primarily comes from the vivid colors and strategic lighting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the dancer’s silhouette been simplified and stylized with bold, smooth lines and exaggerated proportions characteristic of cartoon art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's silhouette remains detailed and retains realistic proportions. Although artistic elements are present, the style does not simplify or exaggerate proportions in a way typical of cartoon art. The silhouette maintains its intricacy and realism.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ruffles of the dancer’s skirt visibly larger and more voluminous than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparison, the skirt's ruffles in Image B are indeed presented as more pronounced and voluminous. The added fiery effect in Image B gives the ruffles an expanded appearance. In Image A, the ruffles are full but not as exaggerated as in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ruffles transformed into swirling shapes resembling flames, with dynamic lines and fiery colors such as red, orange, and yellow. This stylistic choice enhances the visual dynamism resembling flame movements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the floor is illuminated, there is no distinct crescent-shaped moon reflection visible on the ground beneath the dancer. The illumination does not specifically shape a moon reflection.",
