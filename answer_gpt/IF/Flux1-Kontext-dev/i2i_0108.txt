    "Question": "Q1: Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears as a full-body figure rather than just a half-body figure. The entirety of the character down to the legs is visible. The pose and the setup ensure it's a complete 3D representation, even though part of the lower body is obscured by the television in the context of the scene. Therefore, not just half of the body is visible.",
    "answer": "No"
},

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?",
    "explanation": "The positioning of the character in front of the blue screen within the TV frame in Image B creates the illusion that the character is within the TV screen. However, it does not effectively show the character attempting or appearing to break out from it. The background is uniformly blue without any visual effect to suggest breaking or coming out of the television.",
    "answer": "No"
},

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is holding the shield at its side rather than raising it in a defensive position. The shield is prominently visible, but the posture is more relaxed or neutral, without any suggestion of imminent defense.",
    "answer": "No"
},

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image simulate an augmented reality display effect through lighting, shadows, and spatial realism?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the character within a TV screen context, suggesting a digital display. However, the lighting is even and there are no effects such as heightened reflections or shadows that simulate augmented reality effects. The scene relies more on a straightforward rendering inside a TV frame rather than blending or interfacing with the surrounding environment in a dynamic, augmented reality manner.",
    "answer": "No"
},

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the character's original appearance and posture been maintained while implementing the new effects?",
    "explanation": "By observing Image B, the character's costume and posture seem visually consistent with typical portrayals of the character, like in Image A. The consistent elements, such as the costume design and stance, suggest that the edits focused on placing the character within the TV setting, rather than altering the character itself.",
    "answer": "Yes"
