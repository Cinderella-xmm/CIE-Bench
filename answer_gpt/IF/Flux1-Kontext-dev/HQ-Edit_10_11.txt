    "Question": "Q1: Is the gorilla depicted as a wood-carved sculpture rather than a living animal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla appears to be made of a uniform wooden material rather than the varied textures of a living animal, which suggests it is a sculpture. The overall texture and the integration into a frame support this conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the contours of the gorilla's body defined using multiple shades of brown?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is sculpted in a single uniform shade of brown consistent with a wood carving. There are no multiple shades defining the contours, which simplifies the texture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are detailed fur-like textures engraved into the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks any detailed fur-like engravings that would simulate the texture of real fur. The gorilla's surface is smooth and consistent with typical wood carvings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the arms and legs of the sculpture visibly smoother than the rest of the body, lacking fine anatomical detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's arms and legs are depicted with a smooth texture, lacking detailed anatomy such as muscle definition or skin folds, emphasizing a simplified sculptural representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the leafy backdrop been replaced with an etched wooden surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is uniformly wooden and lacks any natural texture and detail found in Image A's leafy setting, indicating it has been replaced with an engraved surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there a few dark-toned leaf shapes integrated into the wooden background, matching the wood carving style?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains leaf shapes that are integrated into the background, crafted in a matching wooden style which contrasts slightly in tone, similar to carved details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the gorilla maintain the same seated posture and hand placement as in the original image?",
    "explanation": "The posture and hand placement of the gorilla in Image B match those in Image A, indicating consistency in pose despite the change in medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"
