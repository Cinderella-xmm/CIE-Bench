      "question": "Has the entire image been rendered in sepia tones consistent with a vintage postcard aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe warm tones and an overall softer color palette than Image A. This often aligns with the sepia tone aesthetic used in vintage postcards. The addition of a decorative border further contributes to the postcard-like appearance. Image A, in contrast, has a more vibrant and natural color palette without such a border.",

      "question": "Does the violinist's dress feature visible floral engravings across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is adorned with floral patterns that appear etched across its surface, indicating engravings. In Image A, the dress is plain and without patterns. Therefore, Image B has visible engravings while Image A does not.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the view through the window been replaced with an abstract painted landscape composed of swirling patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The view through the window in Image B consists of a natural, albeit slightly stylized reflection of tree shadows and light. It does not contain swirling patterns typical of abstract paintings, nor does it differ significantly from the view in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are there visible gold inlays on the violinâ€™s body, neck, or scroll?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the violin does not display any gold inlays on its body, neck, or scroll. The instrument appears similar in design to that in Image A, with no noticeable embellishments of gold.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is there a decorative handwritten music score forming a border around the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a decorative border frames the picture, but it does not resemble a music score. Instead, the border features ornate designs that enhance the vintage aesthetic but lacks any musical notation. Image A lacks this border detail entirely.",
