    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the knight and castle contained within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight and castle are clearly enclosed within a transparent glass dome. This is evident from the visible curved glass that surrounds the entire scene, reflecting light and creating a barrier between the scene and the outer environment, suggesting a display or protective covering.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the knight been transformed into a chibi-style figure with exaggerated proportions (e.g., large head, small body)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight retains realistic proportions typical for humanoid figures, without the exaggerated characteristics of a chibi style such as a disproportionately large head or a small body. The armor and stance are realistic and proportional, indicating that the figure is not chibi-styled.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knight holding a shield made of polished metal with visible reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield in Image B does appear metallic with intricate detailing, suggesting it's made of metal. However, the image style and lighting do not prominently feature reflections typically seen on polished metal surfaces, as the shield's surface appears more matte and textured.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image earthy and muted (e.g., browns, grays, soft greens), consistent with a medieval atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are predominantly earthy and muted, including browns from the wooden base, greens from the grass, and various shades of gray from the castle and the knight's armor. These colors contribute to creating a medieval-like atmosphere in the scene depicted within the dome.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small groups of sheep visible grazing near the knight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of small groups of sheep, there are small, round, fluffy creatures that resemble cartoonish or stylized animals surrounding the knight. These do not resemble actual sheep grazing but may represent whimsical creatures in the scene's narrative.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a dragon visible, curled around a turret, and appearing to be asleep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible dragon wrapped around any turret of the castle. The scene includes a castle and a knight, along with small creatures, but does not show a dragon or any dragon-like entity in any part of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall scene within the dome suggest a whimsical, imaginative narrative (e.g., peaceful coexistence of knight, dragon, and animals)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene within the glass dome in Image B does suggest a whimsical and imaginative narrative. Although there is no dragon, the presence of the knight along with cartoon-like creatures and the fairy-tale setting of the castle under a dome creates a fantasy element that hints at a narrative involving peaceful coexistence among different beings.",
