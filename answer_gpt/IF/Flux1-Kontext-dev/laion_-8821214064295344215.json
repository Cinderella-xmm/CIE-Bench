      "question": "Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bears are depicted with a surface texture that resembles a mosaic pattern, constructed from small, colorful tiles. This design approximately mimicks the fur texture of the original knitted figures, giving the impression of a mosaic figurine. This transformation involves the use of individual tiles arranged in a grid-like manner over the surface of the bears to replicate the appearance of their fur.",

      "question": "Have the knitted sweaters been replaced with intricate tile patterns in yellow and turquoise hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the sweaters worn by the teddy bears are detailed with an intricate pattern of tiles in colors that match the original hues of yellow and turquoise. The texture is transformed from a knitted fabric to a pattern of tiles, imitating the original design with tiles of the same colors, effectively creating a mosaic sweater rather than a knitted one.",

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, snout) recreated using subtly shaded tiles to provide detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the teddy bears, including the eyes, nose, and snout, are comprised of tiles that vary subtly in shade and color to maintain the detail and definition present in the original image. This tile configuration is crafted to preserve the bears' expressions and characteristics despite utilizing a mosaic style.",

      "question": "Do the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles that contrast with the mosaic texture of the rest of the bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the bows on the teddy bears remain in their original state, crafted from satin or similar materials, and do not display the mosaic tile pattern prevalent across the rest of the bears. This maintains a contrast between the glossy, smooth texture of the bows and the intricate mosaic pattern texture rendered on the teddy bears' body.",

      "question": "Are the mosaic bears positioned on a minimalistic white pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bears are situated on a plain, minimalist white surface that resembles a pedestal. This contrasts with Image A, where the bears are on a textured wooden surface. The white pedestal provides a clean and simple base that highlights the mosaic design of the teddy bears.",
