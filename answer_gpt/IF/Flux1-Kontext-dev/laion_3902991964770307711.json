        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra are modified to include clear, tapered glass elements resembling perfume caps.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the arms connecting the top sections appear in a sleek and seamless gold-finish, which suggests editing from the original silver metal or a different design.
