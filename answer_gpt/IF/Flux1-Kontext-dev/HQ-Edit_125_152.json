      "question": "Does the butterfly have its antennae positioned or depicted in a way that suggests motion resembling a conductor's baton?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's antennae are curved and positioned in a manner that resembles the graceful, sweeping motion of a conductor's baton.
