    "Question": "Q1: Is the lion rendered as a high-contrast silhouette with minimal internal detail and strong edge definition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is shown with deep shadows, especially on its face and body, giving it a strong presence. However, the lion's details are visible rather than as a silhouette with minimal internal detail. The mane and facial features retain texture and depth, instead of being reduced to a silhouette with strong edge definition. Therefore, Image B does not depict the lion as a high-contrast silhouette.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Has the background been replaced with an abstract gradient composed of smooth color transitions rather than a realistic savannah landscape?",

The sky does have vibrant color transitions with deeper reds and oranges, creating a dramatic effect but not fully abstract as gradients, maintaining a realistic touch with the clouds and trees.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the acacia trees depicted as angular, stylized silhouettes with sharp edges and geometric forms?",
    "explanation": "The acacia trees in Image B are simplified silhouettes against the bright sky. They have angular forms and sharp edges, emphasizing geometric shapes rather than soft, organic forms. This stylized depiction contrasts with the more natural forms typical of realistic photography.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the title 'King of the Wild' displayed in a dramatic, bold typeface across the upper section of the image without overpowering the lion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'King of the Wild' is indeed displayed in a bold typeface at the top of the image. The font is dramatic, fitting the theme, yet it does not overshadow the lion, which remains visually dominant in the composition. The arrangement ensures the title complements rather than overpowers the main subject.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the lion positioned centrally and visually dominant in the composition, ensuring it remains the primary focus despite other elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is centrally positioned, standing out prominently against the vibrant background. Despite other elements such as text and trees, the lion remains the focal point due to its size, positioning, and the contrast created by the color scheme around it. This ensures the lion is the main subject of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
