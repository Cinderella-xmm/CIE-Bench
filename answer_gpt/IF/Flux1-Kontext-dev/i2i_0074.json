      "question": "Is there a visible main cover title that reads \"Ideal Home\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'IDEAL HOME' is prominently displayed at the top center area of the image. The text is large and bold, which is a typical characteristic of a main cover title in magazine designs. This positioning and style suggest it is intended to be the focal title of the image, aligning with common conventions for magazine covers.",

      "question": "Are there visible section headings related to home design incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has additional text positioned towards the bottom right of the image, but the text does not clearly articulate specific section headings related to home design. While it appears like a potential area for section headings, the visibility and clarity are compromised, preventing definitive recognition as specific headings related to home design.",

      "question": "Is there a distinct text module present that provides price recommendations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom area contains text, which appears stylistically similar to a textual module typically seen in magazines. However, the content is unclear and fragmented, making it difficult to discern any coherent message regarding price recommendations. Therefore, based on the unclear and indistinct appearance of the text, it does not effectively communicate price information.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original bedroom setting, including the bed, furniture, and decor, been preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, aside from the textual additions, retains the entire setting of Image A. This includes the placement and design of the bed, bedside tables, hanging lights, plant, wall art, and other elements present in the bedroom setting. The underlying structure and aesthetic of the original bedroom scene remain unchanged and consistent between the two images.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the image arranged in a format resembling a magazine cover, with the title, sections, and text modules properly positioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B features a prominent title 'IDEAL HOME' at the top and additional textual elements at the bottom, the arrangement lacks clarity and cohesion typical of professional magazine covers. The section headings or text modules are not clearly communicated, and the overall structure appears disjointed. Therefore, although it has some components of a magazine, it does not convincingly convey a fully arranged magazine cover format.",
