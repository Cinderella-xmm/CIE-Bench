      "question": "Is the edited image divided into two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout consists of more than two panels. There are three sections visible: the primary panel showing a person holding a vape device, a second panel with a diagram, and a third panel with another diagram. The edited image is therefore divided into three sections, not two.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the vape device in a simplified, cartoonish, or comic art style rather than detailed realism. It is shown being held by a person, but lacks the intricate details typical in highly realistic renders.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 include a text bubble with the exact phrase “This device vaporizes liquid at low temperatures.”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text bubble in Panel 1 of Image B includes an almost similar message, but the wording is different: ‘This ervicise uiquizes at low temperatures!’ which is not the exact phrase given in the question.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Panel 1 in Image B is a plain blue with no depiction of laboratory equipment or elements typical of a scientific or innovative setting. The background does not suggest laboratory innovation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 in Image B does show a cross-section diagram of the vape device. However, the labels are not clearly legible or typical; instead, they contain distorted or nonsensical words that might represent the coil, liquid, battery, and airflow, but are not clearly identifiable or standard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the font used for text appears stylized, possibly resembling elements of handwriting due to its irregular and illustrative style, mimicking handwritten casual fonts often used in comics rather than standard formal typesetting.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
