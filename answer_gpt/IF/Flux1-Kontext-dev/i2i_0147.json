      "question": "Has melted cheese been added on top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a yellow, textured substance is visible on the hot dogs, resembling melted cheese. Melted cheese typically appears in irregular shapes on hot food items, adding a familiar texture and color. This visual cue, coupled with common knowledge of appearance and toppings on hot dogs, suggests that melted cheese has been added.",

      "question": "Have fried onions been added on top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are darker spots, resembling small, scattered pieces on top of what is identified as melted cheese. This irregular, crispy-looking texture aligns with the visual characteristics of fried onions, which are often added to hot dogs as a topping for crunch and flavor.",

      "question": "Is there a barbecue tong added near the grill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a utensil lying on the grill near the hot dogs. This utensil is a fork, not a tong, as evidenced by its distinct prongs typically associated with forks. Barbecue tongs have a clamping mechanism with broad, flat ends for gripping food items, which is not present here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hot dog buns and sausages are clearly visible and maintain their distinct shapes, making them easily identifiable as hot dogs. The buns have a typical texture and color of bread, while the sausages are smooth and cylindrical, consistent with common hot dog features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the grill bars and underlying glowing flames beneath the hot dogs. The grill structure is visible through the spaces between the hot dogs, and the orange-red color and glow suggest the presence of flames typical in grilling scenarios.",
