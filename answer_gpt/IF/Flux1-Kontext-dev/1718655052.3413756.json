      "question": "Are the hat and scarf now made of wood with visible carving marks and engraved textures that mimic the original woolly pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf have a distinct textured appearance. The hat shows a blocky pattern consistent with carved wood, featuring visible lines and cuts that suggest engraving. This look mimics the original woolly pattern in Image A, though it replaces fabric with a rigid material. The scarf, while looking knitted, presents a similar texture that also implies a wooden structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the dog's fur coat been replaced with LEGO bricks arranged in a way that shows multiple colors and maintains a layered, textured appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the dog's coat has not been transformed into LEGO bricks. The fur remains fluffy and natural-looking, maintaining a uniform white color rather than displaying multiple colors typical of LEGO bricks. This indicates that LEGO bricks were not used for the fur coat.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background now a plain, light-colored wooden tabletop with no distracting elements, providing a clean contrast to the dog and its accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that is uncluttered and light-colored, resembling a wooden tabletop. This background provides a clean and simple contrast that highlights the dog and its accessories without any disruptive or distracting elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the dog’s facial features, including eyes, nose, mouth, and expression, remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's facial features, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, appear to have been altered from Image A. Image B features pronounced and symmetrical features, leading to a distinctly different expression when compared to the original photo. This suggests changes were made to the dog’s facial features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used for the coat composed of warm colors such as orange, red, yellow, or brown to visually suggest warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coat in Image B is not composed of LEGO bricks, but rather shades of white fur. Therefore, the notion of warm-colored LEGO bricks does not apply, as seen from the absence of typical LEGO bricks or warm color tones in its composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the scene still include falling snow, and if so, does it coexist logically with the wooden background and LEGO brick coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any signs of falling snow. The scene is clean and clear, resting on a wooden tabletop background without the presence of such elements. Consequently, there is no context to assess snow coexisting with the wooden background and LEGO brick coat.",
