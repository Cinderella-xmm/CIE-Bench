    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire castle scene enclosed within a transparent glass orb?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire castle scene, including the knight and the gate, is clearly depicted within a transparent glass orb which is visible due to the reflective and refractive effects typical of a glass surface. The orb encapsulates the scene in a manner reminiscent of a snow globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stone textures on the castle walls visibly smaller and more detailed, consistent with a minified appearance?",
    "explanation": "The stone textures in Image B appear consistent with the glass orb's reduced scale representation of the scene. Details are more compact to fit the setting of a miniaturized encapsulated display.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the knight’s armor and the gate structure rendered in an antique bronze color with visible aging effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the knight’s armor and the gate do not exhibit the antique bronze color or visible aging effects. Instead, they maintain a metallic shine and color consistent with polished steel or silver, as opposed to an aged bronze finish.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small, fluttering heraldic flags visible on the battlements of the castle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a small flag is visible at the top of the gate structure. However, there are no additional small, fluttering heraldic flags distributed across the battlements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there small turrets and crenellated walls arranged in a circular pattern around the base of the glass orb?",
    "explanation": "The base of the glass orb in Image B features a circular arrangement of miniature turrets and crenellated walls, resembling the architectural elements of a castle base which supports and encloses the orb.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are golden light rays visibly sculpted into the glass of the orb, emanating from behind the castle to simulate a rising sun?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the rising sun effect is evident as part of the background scene inside the orb, there are no explicit sculpted light rays visible in the glass material itself. The lighting effect is internal rather than an external sculpted feature on the orb.",
    "answer": "No"
