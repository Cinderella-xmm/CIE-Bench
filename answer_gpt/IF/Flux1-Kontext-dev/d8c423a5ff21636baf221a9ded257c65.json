      "question": "Has the individual been transformed into a stylized figurine with a chibi aesthetic, featuring a large head and simplified proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized representation with characteristics often found in chibi aesthetics, such as a larger head in relation to body size, simplified facial features, and a smooth, plastic-like surface texture typical of figurines. These visual cues, combined with world knowledge of such designs, suggest the individual has indeed been transformed into a stylized figurine.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, glossy porcelain-like surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B has a surface that appears uniformly smooth and glossy, attributes often associated with materials like porcelain or plastic. This conclusion is drawn from the visual perception of sheen and lack of texture contrast found in more typical fabric materials.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the primary colors of the dress vivid green and deep red, with visible gold accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress prominently features vivid green and deep red tones. There are also visible gold accents in the necklace and the bands of the dress. These observations help confirm the color palette described in the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a miniature lamb positioned in the figurineâ€™s lap with visibly exaggerated, fluffy wool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does show an animal, instead of a typical lamb, it resembles a toy or a small figurine with smooth features rather than exaggerated and fluffy wool. The stylized figurine does not appear to emphasize the fluffiness of the wool, but rather soft texture, making it distinct from what is described as exaggerated, fluffy wool.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a backdrop that includes landscape elements such as rolling hills and columns, resembling architectural elements typical of Renaissance paintings. The base of the figurine also appears ornate, further supporting this replication of style.",
