    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the scene appear as a digitally rendered holographic installation with visible projection-like effects such as transparency, layering, or digital glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an intense blue aura across the scene, with variegated plants, trees, and waterfalls enveloped in a glowing or luminescent effect. This suggests a digital or holographic rendering, reminiscent of holographic installations that utilize light effects to create depth and layering appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as animated light projections on transparent or reflective glass surfaces instead of natural flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterfalls in Image B have a luminous effect, where the natural texture of water is substituted with a bright glow, suggesting that they could be light projections rather than actual flowing water.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees feature visible iridescent, glowing filaments resembling fiber optics embedded within their trunks and branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees have bright and glowing strands enveloping their form, much like fiber optics in appearance, giving them an iridescent and futuristic look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines appear as virtualized, looping structures with light trails or animated effects, forming a kinetic light sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines in Image B are illustrated with glowing outlines, and the curves and loops seem animated by the light streaming from them, resembling kinetic sculptures made out of light trails.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the environment integrated with futuristic architectural elements such as glass panels, geometric structures, or artificial lighting that blend with the natural forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Though Image B portrays futuristic elements through digital glow effects and holographic appearance, it does not include architectural features like glass panels or geometric structures that are typical of futuristic design elements.",
