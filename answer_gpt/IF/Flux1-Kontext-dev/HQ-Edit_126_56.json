      "question": "Are the mountains rendered as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces instead of realistic contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains feature sharp angles and distinct outlines, but they are not purely geometric shapes with flat surfaces. They have more stylized and exaggerated contours with strong color contrasts compared to realistic mountains. Image A has more natural, soft, and rounded contours typical of realistic mountain landscapes. Therefore, Image B maintains an artistic style but does not fully transform into geometric shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as geometric forms, such as triangular or stepped shapes, with no realistic leaf details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows trees as stylized forms with minimal detail, appearing as triangular shapes, which is typical of a more abstract representation. Image A portrays trees with more realistic textures and detailed leaves. Image B's lack of realistic leaf details and geometric appearance aligns with an abstract, stylized representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the river composed of a series of radiating parallel lines rather than a continuous, reflective body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The river in Image B appears as a continuous, reflective surface with vibrant, stylized color reflections instead of radiating parallel lines. The style involves strong contrast and bold colors but maintains the fluid characteristic of water. Comparing with Image A, both images show a continuous reflection typical of water. Image B retains fluidness in the portrayal of water despite the stylistic color choice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all elements in the image outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bold, clear, and distinct outlines with solid, unshaded colors for the trees, mountains, and other elements, emphasizing a vibrant and graphic style. Image A features more natural gradients and softer color transitions, contributing to realism. Image B's uniform use of solid colors is aligned with a stylistic art approach, contrasting Image A's nuanced shading and subtle detail.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in Image B is stylized and aligned but not perfectly symmetrical or geometrically consistent. The color use and stylization create vividness rather than exact symmetry. Image A presents a reflection with more natural symmetry, reflecting realistic aspects. While stylized, Image B retains artistic representation over precise geometric symmetry.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible gradients or soft shading in the sky, mountains, or water, or are all areas filled with flat, solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of flat, solid colors is prominent, especially in the sky and mountains, adhering to a vibrant and bold art style without soft shading or gradients. Image A incorporates subtle gradients and smooth transitions, adding realism and depth. Image B, with its solid color blocks, accentuates the graphic and vibrant art form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image use a vibrant, high-contrast color palette typical of Art Deco design, including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a highly vibrant, high-contrast color palette with bold hues such as reds, golds, and blues, consistent with Art Deco styling. This choice focuses on visual boldness and dynamic presence, contrasting Image A's softer, gradient-based color scheme. Image B's palette highlights a decorative and energetic artistic expression.",
