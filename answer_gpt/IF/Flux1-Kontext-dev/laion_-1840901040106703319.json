      "question": "Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure shown is a geometric crystal design, characterized by transparent, faceted surfaces typically found in crystals. This contrasts sharply with the log cabin in Image A that is constructed of wooden elements. The design transformation shows a clear replacement from a traditional wooden log cabin to a modern, crystal-like geometric structure composed of transparent surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a structure with transparent, faceted planes that prominently reflect blue and green hues typical of glass or crystal materials. This is observable through the way light interacts with and reflects off these surfaces, producing these specific color hues. This differs significantly from Image A, where the wooden surfaces of the cabin do not possess such reflective or refractive properties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structural integrity of the building is maintained using crystal edges with multiple facets instead of wooden beams. These facet-like features can be seen on edges and supports, replacing the wood used for structural purposes in Image A's cabin, indicating a transformation from wood to crystal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the crystal structure positioned on a sleek, flat surface resembling white marble, which is indicative of a luxurious or modern setting. In contrast, Image A features a natural ground and driveway with no such marble surface present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small crystal formations present as decorative accents along the base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are decorative crystal formations present along the base, clearly seen beside the platform. These formations contribute ornamental value, aligning with the overall crystal aesthetic. Image A does not feature these decorative elements, as it shows a more rugged, natural landscape surrounding the log cabin.",
