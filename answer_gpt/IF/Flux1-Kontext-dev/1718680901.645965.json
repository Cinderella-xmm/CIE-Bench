    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a creature present in the image that is clearly inspired by the architectural style of the building, including features such as spires and layered roof-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, there is no distinct creature present. The edit consists of a spherical object placed in front of the building, but it lacks any features typical of creatures, such as eyes, limbs, or identifiable organic forms. The object does not visibly integrate with the architectural style of the building, such as spires or layered roofs that are common in creatures inspired by such architecture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the creature feature structural elements resembling the building’s spires and intricate roof designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no creature present that possesses elements resembling the building's spires and intricate roof designs. The scene includes only a spherical object, which lacks the pointed, layered, or roof-like structures typical of architectural inspiration.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a spherical object located at the creature’s feet that includes visible architectural details such as pillars, arches, or columnar patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is a spherical object placed prominently. Although it sits in front of the building, it contains its own distinct decorative patterns and base but lacks pillars, arches, or columnar features directly on its surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any creature, nor is there any visible text near the spherical object that could signify a fantasy-style name. The absence of textual elements in the immediate vicinity indicates that no such name is visible.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no creature in Image B, nor is there any label or visual symbol indicating any elemental type. A spherical object is present, but it lacks elements such as text or symbols denoting elemental classification.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no creature to assess these qualities. The object present in the image is spherical and has some structural design, but does not embody the characteristics such as detailed textures or shading associated with a majestic creature.",

      "question": "Does the surrounding environment retain the serene atmosphere with natural elements like trees and water reflections, and does it integrate seamlessly with the creature?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B maintains a serene atmosphere with visible trees and water reflections, the integration aspect does not apply to a creature, as there is none present. The environment complements the architectural style of the building, but no further integration with a creature is relevant here.",
