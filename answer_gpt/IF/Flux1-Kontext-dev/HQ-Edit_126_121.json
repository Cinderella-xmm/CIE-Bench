      "question": "Is the gorilla holding bananas depicted as the central artwork on the front of the cereal box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the central artwork on the cereal box prominently features a gorilla holding a large bunch of bananas.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image (Image B), the text 'Jungle Crunch' is not present. Instead, the text 'JINGGEICH' appears prominently across the top of the box. This suggests a thematic but different naming for the product compared to 'Jungle Crunch'.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a cereal box where vibrant green and yellow colors dominate the design. The lush green background suggests a tropical setting, while the bananas' yellow color emphasizes the playful packaging theme.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
