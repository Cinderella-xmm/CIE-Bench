      "question": "Has the formal suit been replaced with a vibrant, floral-patterned design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit has a prominent floral design with bright and varied colors, which is significantly different from the plain, formal suit in Image A that features a dark color without any patterns. The presence of colorful flowers and the enhancement of vibrance indicate a deliberate stylistic change. This conclusion is based on recognizing the floral imagery and associating the bright, colorful patterns with non-traditional, artistic alterations of a classic garment.",

      "question": "Has the bow tie been replaced with a bold, colorful design featuring geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a bow tie that is colorful and aligns with geometric patterns, contrasting with the checked pattern observed in Image A's bow tie. The use of bright colors and more defined geometric lines as seen in the edited image suggests a modification towards a more bold and artistic design. This reasoning acknowledges both the pattern and the color scheme changes.",

      "question": "Does the background feature a distinct dotted texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background displays a dotted pattern in contrasting bright colors (yellow and pink), which creates a distinctive and visually recognizable texture. This pattern is typical for certain artistic styles such as pop art. Comparing with Image A, which has a plain grayscale background, the difference in pattern and texture is evident and striking.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of pop art style, such as bold outlines, flat colors, and high contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B embodies several characteristics synonymous with pop art, such as vibrant colors, the use of bold outlines, and flat color planes that contribute to a high-contrast visual experience. These stylistic features distinguish pop art from more traditional styles and are not present in Image A, which has a more subdued and realistic rendering.",

      "question": "Have the subject’s facial features, expression, and posture remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images have the subject's face blurred, so facial features and expression cannot be compared. However, assessing posture by means of body position reflected in the visible attire: Given that both images keep a similar position of shoulders and suit but face blur obscures the ability to verify more detailed elements, it implies the posture is maintained as there are no visible cues suggesting change.",
