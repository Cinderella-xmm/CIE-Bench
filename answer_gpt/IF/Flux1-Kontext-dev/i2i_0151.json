      "question": "Does the kite have a design that resembles or suggests it could be made as a paper craft model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is part of a postcard with additional smaller kites placed around the card. These smaller kites seem to be made of paper and are positioned in a way that suggests a 'paper craft' feel. Additionally, the crisp folds and visible edges of the smaller kites emphasize the impression of paper crafting. This context, combined with the flat and structured look of the kites, leads to the conclusion that the kite is designed with a resemblance to paper crafts.",

      "question": "Are the colors used for the kite vibrant and suitable for representing cultural significance on a postcard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B is bright yellow, which is a vibrant and eye-catching color. Yellow is often associated with happiness and energy, making it suitable for a culturally significant item like a postcard that aims to capture attention and convey a positive message or celebration. The use of this color implies cultural vibrancy and stands out well against the blue sky, making it aesthetically pleasing and significant as a cultural representation.",

      "question": "Is the kite prominently featured in the image, with minimal distracting elements around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is the focal point on the postcard, set against a mostly clear blue sky with only a few clouds that do not distract from the kite itself. The postcard layout frames the kite without overwhelming it with other objects, ensuring it remains the center of attention. The artistic setup of the card is intended to highlight the kite specifically, and only small paper kites accompany the main image, which do not distract from the primary focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the structural details of the kite, such as its frame and tail, well-defined and clear enough to suggest it could be crafted from paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B has distinct, defined lines where the frame and panels meet, a characteristic trait of paper models. This, along with the flatness and clear visibility of the tail and edge details, provides the impression that the kite could be effectively replicated as a paper craft. Additionally, the textured and slightly rigid appearance adds to the notion that its construction could be from paper, enabling optimal clarity and definition for crafting.",
