      "question": "Does the edited image show the smartwatch transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon with dragon-like anatomy integrated into the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartwatch retains its general watch form factor, with no indication of a dragon-like anatomy or the presence of any dragon features. It still looks like a typical smartwatch, just with some design changes. The absence of dragon-like elements such as scales, claws, or a dragon's head or tail supports that the device remains similar in structure to a traditional smartwatch without dragon characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the watch face replaced with a radiant, multi-layered holographic dragon eye featuring glowing elements and depth effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch face in Image B displays a design with glowing icons arranged in a circular pattern, giving a futuristic, technological appearance, but it does not resemble a dragon's eye. It lacks the specific features like the detailed depth and iris of a dragon's eye. Instead, it has a more technical interface look rather than an organic eye design.",

      "question": "Are the original silicone band and its contours replaced with a series of interlocking, metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartwatch band has been replaced with a metallic strap composed of interlocking segments that resemble scales. This transformation from the silicone band in Image A to a more metallic, segmented appearance gives the watch an advanced, cybernetic look, similar to a scaled feature.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the digital crown been replaced with a glowing, spherical neural node emitting light or energy pulses, resembling a biotech interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital crown in Image B has been modified to include a glowing element, suggesting an advanced technological interface. However, it still maintains the basic shape and function of a traditional crown rather than being completely spherical or radically different to resemble a neural node. It doesn't emit distinct light or energy pulses resembling a biotech interface as described but shows slight glowing accents.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original app icons on the watch face replaced with glowing, rune-like control sigils that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face does showcase icons with a glowing effect in a circular pattern. These have a more advanced or futuristic design compared to the standard icons seen in Image A. The glowing and neon-blue theme gives them a tech-magic vibe, moving away from traditional app icons to something resembling control sigils.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic form with visual cues such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B of the smartwatch doesn't show any visual cues that would suggest movement or life. The watch rests in a neutral position without indications of energy flow or motion lines commonly used to depict dynamic action. It remains static in its presentation.",
