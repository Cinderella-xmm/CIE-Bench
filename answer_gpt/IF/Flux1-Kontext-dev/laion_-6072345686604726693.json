      "question": "Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of what seems to be a fantastical creature with distinct features such as a spherical body, wings, and limbs resembling arms and claws. This is unlike the traditional structure of Hagia Sophia with its domes and minarets seen in Image A. The creature-like figure suggests a transformation from the architectural design to an imaginative creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is shown with large, golden wing-like structures extending outward from the main body, which are metallic and decorative. These wings do not resemble the traditional smaller domes of Hagia Sophia from Image A, but instead are distinctly separate and fantastical in nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's design includes limb structures, but they do not appear as replacements for the minarets. The legs are part of the creature's anatomy, distinct from the minarets visible in Image A, which do not appear in a leg-like form in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structureâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features intricate, decorative patterns covering the creature's metallic surface, which are reminiscent of Byzantine art's elaborate and ornate style. These patterns add to the fantastical design, different from the historical surfaces seen in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head or top of the creature features a large, star-like form that is both jewel-like and cosmic in appearance. This is a significant departure from the central dome structure of Hagia Sophia in Image A, which lacks such cosmic and jewel-like characteristics.",
