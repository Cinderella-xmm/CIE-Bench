      "question": "Has the ornate lantern been fully transformed into a jellyfish shape, with a bell-shaped body and flowing appendages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a structure that closely resembles a jellyfish, characterized by a bell-shaped dome and trailing appendages that evoke the natural movement of a jellyfish. Based on common knowledge of marine life and jellyfish anatomy, the transformation from the ornate lantern design to this jellyfish form indicates a full transformation where the lantern's body has adopted organic features typical of a jellyfish. This observation confirms that the lantern has indeed been fully transformed into a shape representing a jellyfish.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the metal framing elements been replaced with iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils extending from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the visual cues suggest that the original metal frame no longer appears rigid or metallic. Instead, we observe flowing, ribbon-like tendrils trailing from the jellyfish's body, which give the impression of fluidity and a soft, organic appearance distinct from any rigid metal structure. These tendrils exhibit an iridescent glow which is not typical of metal frames, completing the transformation.",

      "question": "Have the glass panels been transformed into a translucent, bell-shaped body that appears soft and fluid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a body that is distinctly bell-shaped and maintains a translucent quality, reminiscent of jellyfish commonly observed in nature. The soft, fluid appearance of the bell-shaped structure in the image suggests that the previously glass panels of the lantern have been reimagined as a part of the jellyfish, exhibiting a flexible, organic form that aligns with the characteristics of a soft-bodied sea creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original patterns replaced with glowing, swirling, organic bioluminescent designs within the jellyfish's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image reveals glowing patterns on what resembles the jellyfish's dome. These patterns seem organic and vibrant, emanating a bioluminescent appearance typically seen in certain marine species. While the original lantern had ornate metal and glass designs, the current patterns in Image B are more fluid and appear to naturally emulate the glow from within the jellyfish's body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing, star-like nodules visible along the length of the iridescent tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, close inspection of the tendrils shows the presence of small, glowing nodules that resemble star-like points along the length of these appendages. This feature aligns with the portrayal of bioluminescent organisms in marine environments, where such nodules may enhance the overall glowing effect typical of some jellyfish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the jellyfish depicted floating in an underwater environment with ambient lighting, soft diffusion, and visual elements suggesting water (e.g., particles, light rays, depth)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surrounding environment in Image B supports an underwater setting. The ambient lighting and the subtle diffusion effect contribute to an atmosphere typically associated with being submerged. Additionally, the presence of visual details such as light rays penetrating water and the depth perception created by darkness and diffuse highlights confirm this impression, situating the jellyfish within a convincingly underwater scene.",
