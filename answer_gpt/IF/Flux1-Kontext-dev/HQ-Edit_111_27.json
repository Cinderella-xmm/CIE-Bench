      "question": "Does the geisha's figure appear as a stained glass artwork with distinct lead-like outlines separating colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha figure is rendered with fluid outlines and intricate details on the kimono but lacks distinct lead-like outlines often found in stained glass artworks. The colors are vibrant, but the enclosed sections are not separated by bold lines typical of stained glass. Therefore, the geisha's figure does not resemble stained glass artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B does include interwoven lines and decorative elements, but it is more geometric and stylized rather than reflecting the organically curving lines and abstract mosaic pattern typical of Art Nouveau design. Art Nouveau often involves less rigid structures and more flowing forms than what is seen in Image B.",
