      "question": "Does the edited version retain the original photo subjects (polar bear and cubs in an icy setting)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subjects, which are a polar bear and two cubs situated on an icy terrain with an ocean background, are clearly visible and unchanged. The visual analysis shows that the central subjects of the original image remain intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the color tone of the image been slightly cooled to include more blue and white hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a predominance of natural elements with the icy setting and ocean in view, primarily showing blues and whites. The image does not seem overly edited in terms of its color palette when compared to typical icy scenes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bold headline reading “Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.” located in the top right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the top right corner of Image B, there is text present, but it reads: 'CRECEFTE. OLY LEFT. NOWHERE IIJID GOI.' This is a distorted or incorrectly rendered version of the intended phrase, 'Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.'",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is visible text in a banner format, resembling a footer with dense character strings suggesting an organization name or purpose; however, it appears to be incomprehensible or jumbled, not clearly legible as a standard organizational branding or website.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a serious tone with realistic elements, such as the polar bears and the icy surroundings, which preserve the original style. The only distortion is in textual elements, but it does not change the photographic and thematic realism.",
