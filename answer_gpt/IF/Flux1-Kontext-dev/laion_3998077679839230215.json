      "question": "Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents six separate chibi-style illustrations, each focusing on distinct elements of traditional attire and accessories. These include different blouses, a lehenga, a dupatta, jewelry items (earrings, tiara), bangles, and various hairstyles, supporting the idea that these illustrations are representative of specific fashion components. The arrangement suggests a focus on these elements individually, albeit with variations in style (such as different blouses), aligning with the concept of detachable illustrations or magnets for mix-and-match purposes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The style of Image B shows illustrations typical of chibi art, with bright colors and a cartoonish style, but from the visual cues, there is no indication of a glossy or reflective surface commonly associated with actual magnets or stickers. Instead, they appear to be flat illustrations without visible shine or reflections.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style illustrations are cutouts with smoothly rounded edges, characteristic of sticker or magnet design meant for safe handling.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases illustrations that represent different elements of traditional South Asian attire. Several illustrations depict blouses, the lehenga, the dupatta, and various pieces of jewelry like earrings and bangles. However, there's no distinct depiction of an ornate background wall pattern as a standalone feature among the magnets. Instead, the focus is on clothing and accessory parts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrations in Image B are rendered in a chibi art style, characterized by exaggerated proportions such as large heads relative to the body and simplified facial features. This style is evident across all the illustrations, adhering to the typical aspects of chibi art that emphasize cuteness and simplicity.",

      "question": "Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations are presented separately but together on one layout, suggesting they are part of a set. Each illustration focuses on a specific component of attire or accessory, which supports the idea of them being collectible and interchangeable items. They are designed to give a sense of collectibility and mix-and-match utility, typical of such sets.",
