      "question": "Is the palm tree and cactus positioned within the frame of a Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show a Polaroid-style photo being held by hands, with the palm tree and cactus visible within the frame. This is evident from the shape and characteristic white border of the photograph held by fingers, both of which are typical features of Polaroid images. Based on the world knowledge of Polaroid photographs and hand positions, it's clear that the palm tree and cactus are inside the photograph being held.",

      "question": "Has the cactus been transformed into a 3D chibi-style character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the cactus retains its natural form with detailed texture and appearance that are characteristic of a real cactus, rather than a stylized chibi character. The cactus has not been altered to include features typical of chibi style such as large eyes, exaggerated proportions, or playful characteristics that one would expect from a chibi-style transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cactus appear to be stepping out of the Polaroid frame, breaking into the real-world 3D space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visuals indicate that the cactus is neatly contained within the boundaries of the Polaroid frame. There are no signs or effects suggesting that the cactus extends beyond the confines of the photograph or interacts with the real-world space outside the Polaroid frame. The common visual effects associated with breaking dimensional barriers are absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image create a whimsical and surreal effect through the combination of the Polaroid frame, the chibi cactus, and the real-world interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combination of a real palm tree and cactus within a Polaroid photograph frame held by hands suggests a curated photographic display. However, the cactus has not been transformed into a chibi style, nor does it interact with the real world outside the confines of the photograph. The absence of such whimsical transformations reduces the surreal nature despite the Polaroid being held. Therefore, the edited image does not fully create a whimsical or surreal effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree is visibly unchanged from its original form as seen inside the Polaroid photograph. It retains the same structure, proportion, and color as in Image A, suggesting no edits were made to transform or stylize it beyond its natural appearance.",
