      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the island visibly floating above the water, disconnected from any land or water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island appears to be on the water surface, as indicated by the reflection of the buildings and structures in the lake, typical of objects on a water surface. Common sense suggests that floating islands would not have direct reflections in the water in this manner. The island itself does not appear elevated or separated from the water's surface, as seen from the design and shadows. Thus, it appears like an ordinary island resting on water rather than floating.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all building roofs replaced with mushroom-shaped canopies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are large mushroom structures around or above the buildings, the buildings themselves retain traditional red-tiled roofs. By knowing architectural norms, typical building roofs are not replaced but may coexist with other structures. The buildings maintain their original architectural character despite the surrounding surreal elements.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lake's reflection appear distorted, shimmering, or iridescent rather than a clear mirror image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases reflections in the water with a vibrant, clear appearance, matching the colors and shapes of objects, particularly buildings and mushrooms. These reflections suggest a form of mirror-like surface or transparency typical of calm water rather than distortion. Common reflection behaviors in physics indicate that the mirroring effect is clear, not shimmering or iridescent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mountains in the background morphed into structures resembling giant tree roots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains behind the island retain their natural form and surface texture typical of geological formations. There are no visual cues indicating a transformation into tree-root-like structures; they remain consistent with common depictions of mountainous landscapes in terms of shapes and textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible green vines connecting the buildings on the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are prominent vine-like structures originating from the large mushrooms that extend across the landscape. They wrap around the buildings and integrate with the environment, resembling natural vines, which connect structurally and visually with the buildings. This understanding aligns with common nature-inspired designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there colorful, translucent, or glowing bridges connecting the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features traditional wooden bridges visually matching the style of the buildings with similar color themes. These do not exhibit properties of translucency or glowing elements, aligning more closely with typical bridge designs made from solid materials.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the boats replaced with leaf-shaped airships floating above pastel-colored clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a structure resembling an airship with green roof elements floating and attached to the larger mushroom. This design combines airship motifs with nature-inspired elements. The lower portions of the scene also include cloud-like formations typical of fantasy landscapes, suggestive of whimsical, imaginative design shifts.",
