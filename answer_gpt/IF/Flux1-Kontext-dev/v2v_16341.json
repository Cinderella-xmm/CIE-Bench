        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features lush green grass and trees under clear blue skies, indicative of a sunlit park environment. The lighting appears to be bright and shadows from the trees suggest natural direct sunlight, which is typical in a park setting. This contrasts with the original background in Image A, which shows a rain-soaked path and blurred, grayish surroundings suggesting a rainy day.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are dressed in clothing that appears well-suited for a mild, sunny day. While they still carry umbrellas, a typical accessory for rain, the setting suggests they might be using them for shade rather than for rain. This contrasts with Image A, where rain gear like raincoats and umbrellas suggest weather preparedness for rain. The overall wardrobe color scheme also supports the sunny setting.",
