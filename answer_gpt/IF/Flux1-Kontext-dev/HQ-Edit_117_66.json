      "question": "Is the ornate book now represented as a collection of interlocking wooden puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B's visual cues, we observe the presence of puzzle pieces around the ornate book, suggesting a transformation of the book's design into puzzle pieces. This implies that the ornate book has been depicted as interlocking puzzle pieces, as the pieces are placed alongside it in a manner that aligns with its design. Common sense indicates that puzzles are assembled from pieces, further supporting the idea of transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dragon patterns stained with darker wood tones compared to the rest of the puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon patterns on the ornate book show darker tonal variations compared to the surrounding puzzle pieces. The combination of intricate carvings and shadow effects on the dragon patterns results in darker wood tones, indicating a stylistic choice to emphasize these elements. This perception comes from how darker stains can accentuate detailed designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the compass area rendered in lighter wood tones than the dragon patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass area appears slightly lighter than the dragon patterns. This observation is based on contrasting tones where lighter shades are often used to highlight central or focal elements, making the compass a clearer point of focus compared to the surrounding darker-toned dragon patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture clearly visible on the surface of the puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces seem to lack visible wood grain texture, appearing smooth and polished. Wood grain usually presents as streaks or lines, which are not prominent in these puzzle pieces, indicating a more refined surface without the natural grain appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the puzzle pieces, each with clearly defined edges. The interlocking nature of puzzle pieces ensures that their edges are designed for fitting together seamlessly, and visual inspection confirms that these edges are smooth and well-defined.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design elements in Image B, like the dragons and compass, benefit from contrasting wood tones that bring out their intricacy. Light and dark tonal variations allow the carved details to stand out, emphasizing the craftsmanship and design complexity, which is often achieved through contrast in color tones.",
