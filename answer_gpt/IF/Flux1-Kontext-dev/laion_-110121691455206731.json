      "question": "Is the edited image a comic strip consisting of at least two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows two separate panels. The first panel has a character sitting at a detective desk, engaging in dialogue. The second panel continues the theme, but shows the character holding a magnifying glass, thus establishing it as a comic strip format.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the watch does not have a face drawn on its dial, nor is it depicted polishing its metal exterior. Instead, a person is shown at a detective desk engaging with paperwork.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Neither of the panels in Image B show sound effects like 'tick' or 'tock' around the watch dial. Instead, the panels feature dialogue and visual actions.",
