      "question": "Has the bird been converted into a 3D chibi-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird displays characteristics typical of a 3D chibi-style model, such as a more rounded, cartoonish form with exaggerated features like large eyes. This style tends to give animals a playful and cute appearance, which is consistent with the representation of the bird in Image B. In contrast, Image A presents a more realistic depiction of a bird, common in classical painting styles, which relies on realistic proportions and shading to convey a lifelike appearance.",

      "question": "Has the lemur been converted into a 3D chibi-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lemur also appears to exhibit characteristics of a 3D chibi-style model. The lemur's body and facial features are simplified and stylized compared to a realistic portrayal, resulting in a softer and cuter appearance. The pronounced and larger-than-usual eyes are typical of chibi-style renderings. Image A, by contrast, depicts the lemur in a detailed and realistic manner, consistent with traditional painting methods.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters exhibit the features of 3D chibi-style models, characterized by simplified forms, softer edges, and a cartoon-like appearance. The proportions are adjusted to have a more rounded and exaggerated form compared to realistic human anatomy. Image A showcases the characters with realistic proportions and a painterly style, typical of traditional murals or illustrations, as opposed to the stylized form in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the outfits and accessories of the characters preserved after being converted into 3D chibi-style models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters' outfits and accessories, such as clothing colors, styles, and the presence of the pocket watch, are faithful representations of those in Image A. The conversion to a 3D chibi-style model retains these elements while adapting their forms to fit the new, stylized aesthetic. This indicates attention to consistency in the transition from the traditional art style to chibi format.",

      "question": "Is the arrangement of the scene, including the positions of the characters, bird, and lemur, the same as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B replicates the positioning and composition seen in Image A. The relative arrangement between the characters, the bird, and the lemur remains consistent, demonstrating a thoughtful conversion where positional fidelity is maintained from the classical depiction to the 3D chibi-style representation. The scene's overall spatial setup in Image B closely mirrors that of Image A, aligning with the original composition.",
