      "question": "Is the image now a whimsical comic illustration rather than a formal diagram?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it has transformed into a playful and visually appealing comic illustration with cartoonish animal characters and a storybook setting, including whimsical elements like bright colors, character roles, and a narrative banner, all indicative of whimsically styled comics, unlike the structured, serious design of Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Business Understanding section features a fox character holding a staff and wearing glasses, which indicates a sage-like depiction. While an owl would symbolize wisdom typically, the fox serves this purpose visually similar to an owl through visual cues that denote intelligence and insight.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a barrel-like structure labeled 'Data' remains central, with no glowing data crystals or guardians depicted around it.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include speech bubbles or comedic dialogues related to character roles. It portrays animal characters positioned around different sections but forgoes such textual additions, keeping the roles visual and implied through context.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is square-shaped with equal dimensions, suggesting a 1:1 aspect ratio rather than a 3:4 aspect ratio. Both images are square, with Image A being similarly shaped, confirming no change in aspect ratio compared to Image B.",
