      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog is illustrated in a style that does not emphasize chibi-like features such as an oversized head, large eyes, or an exaggerated expression typical of chibi designs. Instead, it maintains a more realistic depiction, albeit simplified. Chibi style often involves disproportionate anatomy for a cuter appearance, which is not present here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, these objects are drawn in a style that lacks detailed shading and gradients, characteristic of a minimalist flat design. The color fills are solid, and there is no visible attempt to create a 3D effect or depth, which aligns with the flat design principles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog is not the most prominent element in terms of size or focus. The bench and items placed on top of it draw equal attention, and the dog's features are not particularly highlighted or distinct. The design distributes attention across all elements rather than emphasizing the dog more prominently.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the illustration incorporate a bold white outline around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bold white outline is clearly visible around the entire composition, which serves to set the illustration apart from the background and create a sticker-like effect. This is a common technique used to give illustrations a distinct boundary.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog and bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame of the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the dog and the bench are contained within the circular frame. There is no part of these elements that extends beyond the round perimeter defined by the white outline, suggesting a careful bounding within the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the illustration transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of a bold white outline with a gradient effect creating a halo implies that there is a defined background rather than transparency. The image does not have a transparent background; instead, it features a gradient that interacts with the surrounding white outline.",
