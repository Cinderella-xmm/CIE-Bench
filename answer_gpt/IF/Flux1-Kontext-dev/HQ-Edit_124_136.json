      "question": "Is the figure now depicted as a Byzantine monk with appropriate monastic attire and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B has a long beard and is dressed in robes that include intricate designs, commonly associated with religious or monastic attire. Monastic attire, especially in Byzantine imagery, often features such elaborate decoration along with a head covering similar to the circular headwear seen here. These elements combined suggest that the figure's appearance aligns with that of a Byzantine monk.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the robe in Image B, there do not appear to be any visible scripts or text woven into its design. The robes feature elaborate patterns and detailed embroidery but lack any discernible scripts that resemble Aramaic or any other writing system.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the instrument been replaced with a lyre that includes visible scribed bronze details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The instrument in Image B remains a stringed instrument resembling a lute rather than a lyre. It lacks the distinct tuning structure of a lyre, which typically has a frame or resonator with strings attached to it. Additionally, there are no visible bronze details on the instrument in the form of scribed markings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features trees with abundant leaves, consistent with a lush, garden-like setting. However, these trees do not have the distinctive appearance of olive trees, such as their narrow, silvery-green leaves, which are a characteristic feature of olive trees.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indeed showcases elements reminiscent of Byzantine mosaic art, such as the use of rich, jewel-toned colors and a bordered composition encircling the main figure. These artistic choices align with the complex patterns and color schemes typical of Byzantine mosaics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the musician is visibly seated on an ornately carved stone bench. This contrasts with Image A, where the musician is seated directly among the flowers on the ground. The presence of the bench in Image B gives the scene a more structured and formal appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the face being blurred, the posture of the musician in Image B—calmly holding and playing the stringed instrument—conveys a sense of tranquility and focus, which can be interpreted as devotion. The symmetrical and composed pose further enhances this interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
