      "question": "Has the fabric of the Victorian attire been dissolved into cosmic dust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire retains its distinct texture and structure, indicative of traditional fabric, rather than appearing dissolved or integrated with its cosmic surroundings. The clothing remains clearly delineated, without blending into a cosmic or ethereal state, maintaining its proper form and distinction. Thus, the clothing does not dissolve into cosmic dust.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the brass scientific instrument exhibit intricate, clockwork tendrils growing from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the scientific instrument with vine-like structures emerging from it, which resemble intricate clockwork or mechanical tendrils. These elements are added in the image to suggest growth or extension, indicating an artistic blend of mechanics and organic growth, fitting the description.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clockwork tendrils softly grasping the monkey's subtly distorted hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the tendrils emanating from the instrument extend around the monkey's hands but do not appear to grasp them. Their presence is noticeable, yet they do not interact with the hands in a holding or grasping manner. Therefore, the hands are not subtly distorted or clasped by the tendrils.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dreamlike and imaginative merger of cosmic imagery and the anthropomorphic depiction of a monkey in Victorian attire, alongside mechanical and organic elements like the instrument's tendrils, invokes a surreal quality in Image B. This blend of reality and fantastical elements is characteristic of Surrealism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the monkey in Victorian attire and the brass scientific instrument remains consistent with Image A, maintaining the original posture and layout. Despite additional surreal elements like the clockwork tendrils, the fundamental composition is unaltered.",
