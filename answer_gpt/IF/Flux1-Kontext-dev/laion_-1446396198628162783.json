        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Journey to Space' is prominently placed at the top of the image. It is displayed in a large, bold font which is easily readable and stands out against the dark background. This clear visual placement makes it likely that the title is an integral part of the design and thematic context of the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut figure is still present and takes a central position in the design layout. It occupies the middle section of the image, surrounded by various illustrative icons and text. The astronaut remains the focal point, maintaining its central importance as a subject of the journey mentioned in the title, which indicates continuity with Image A where the astronaut was also central.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B does not feature elements typical of a mission control center, such as control panels or screens. Instead, it has been stylized with digital illustrations related to space and training stages, providing a thematic and educational environment rather than a physical representation of a mission control setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the training stages are indeed color-coded with distinct backgrounds per section. These vibrant backgrounds help differentiate and highlight each stage, reinforcing their individual importance and contributing to an organized visual layout.",
