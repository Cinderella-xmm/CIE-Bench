      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual of the cat shows a similar curled-up posture as the one commonly noticed when cats lie down comfortably. By observing the position of the catâ€™s limbs and body, you can infer that it is indeed curled up. This observation aligns with common knowledge of how cats often rest while conserving body heat, thus maintaining a curled form.",

      "question": "Is the cat's fur represented by simple gradient color blocks in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur of the cat is depicted with a level of detail that allows individual strands and textures to be visible, although it may look artistically stylized. However, it does not appear to be represented using simple gradient color blocks, which would imply a very basic, uniform shading without detail. Instead, there is a complexity in the texture and shading, which suggests no simple gradient color blocks were used.",

      "question": "Has the car been simplified to a curved surface with only reflection lines present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include the car at all; the cat image seems isolated for a sticker-style format. The background has been removed, and therefore any representation of the car or its reflections has been excluded altogether. As a result, there is no simplification of the car to any surface.",

    {

      "question": "Does the sticker have an irregular shape with a thick white outline and a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the cat image as a stand-alone sticker-like design with a discernible white outline around it. The shape is irregular, conforming to the silhouette of the cat, which matches the characteristics of a sticker design where emphasis is often placed on the subject outline. The background of the sticker is predominantly a uniform gray, which can imply transparency if placed as a sticker over differing surfaces.",

      "question": "Is the entire image styled in a minimalist illustration manner suitable for a chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat image with some stylization, making it suitable as an artistic, illustrated sticker, but it does retain significant detail, especially in the texture of the fur and the facial features, which is not typical of the chibi style. Chibi style is characterized by exaggerated features, such as large heads and minimal detail. The image does not entirely fit into a minimalist illustration manner typical of the chibi style.",
