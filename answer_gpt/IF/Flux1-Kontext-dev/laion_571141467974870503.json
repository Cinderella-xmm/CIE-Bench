      "question": "Is the overall scene rendered in a pop art style with bright, flat colors and comic book-like aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is characterized by bright and flat colors such as vibrant pink, blue, and yellow, which are common in pop art. The use of halftone dot patterns further enhances the comic book-like aesthetics. This stylization is typical of pop art, which often employs bold, contrasting colors and simplified forms to convey a modern, graphic look. The bright color palette and stylized elements are visually striking and match the pop art style which simplifies shapes and uses bold outlines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train feature bold primary colors (such as red, blue, or yellow) and halftone dot patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B shows areas that are predominantly colored with bold primary colors such as blue and red. These are prominent hues in the pop art style. Additionally, there is an evident use of halftone dot patterns on the train's surface, which is a signature element commonly employed in comic books and pop art to create shading and texture effects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the barnâ€™s wooden texture been replaced with stylized geometric shapes instead of realistic wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn does not exhibit the typical grain of wooden texture seen in Image A. Instead, the surface is filled with flat, solid colors and a halftone dot overlay, giving it a geometric, blocky appearance. This transformation uses stylized geometric forms to represent the barn, a departure from the realistic depiction of wood grain found in natural settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the trees and grass been converted into vibrant, abstract, graphic bursts rather than realistic vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and grass do not depict the realistic colors and textures seen in Image A. Instead, they are rendered in vibrant blues and have been abstracted with a combination of solid fills and halftone dots, giving them a graphical, burst-like appearance. This abstraction corresponds to an artistic technique where natural elements are stylized to fit within an illustrative and vibrant pop art design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image (train, barn, tracks, foliage) outlined with sharp, black lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train, barn, tracks, and foliage are outlined with distinct, sharp black lines, contributing to a comic book aesthetic. This technique of using black outlines is typical in graphic and pop art styles, highlighting and separating different elements to create a more pronounced and visually clean appearance. This approach differs from Image A where natural and subtle transitions define the elements.",
