    "Question": "Q1: Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot appears transparent with visible reflections and light passing through, indicating that it is made of clear glass. This conclusion is drawn from visual cues such as the teapot's transparency and the way light behaves around it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the body of the teapot transparent, allowing visibility through it?",
    "explanation": "The body of the teapot in Image B allows visibility through it, as demonstrated by the ability to see the frosted floral patterns and the reflective effects of light within the glass, typical characteristics of transparency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",
    "explanation": "The frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot in Image B are visible and resemble the same design elements, such as roses and leaves, seen in the original metallic version (Image A). This is inferred from the presence of similar motifs and arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the handle and spout made of tinted amber glass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the handle and spout have an amber tint, suggesting they are crafted from tinted amber glass. This conclusion is based on the distinct color and material appearance perceived visually.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored surface showing a clear reflection?",
    "explanation": "The reflective surface beneath the teapot in Image B shows a clear, mirrored reflection of the teapot, providing evidence of a mirrored surface. Light reflecting and mirroring characteristics are visible, supporting this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the floral patterns on the teapot retain the same level of detail and design as the original engravings?",
    "explanation": "Although Image B maintains similar floral patterns, the level of detail and intricacy appear less refined than the engraved metal in Image A. This comparison shows variation in depth and texture between engraved metal and frosted glass patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the teapot retain the original shape and proportions of the original metallic version?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, it is evident that the shape and proportions of the teapot are consistent between the images, maintaining the same outline and structural characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
