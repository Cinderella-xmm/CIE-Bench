      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a hand-painted watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presentation of the entire image demonstrates characteristics common to watercolor paintings, such as the soft blending of colors, lack of sharp edges, and a slightly washed-out look. This style gives the image an overall painted appearance, which is indicative of watercolor art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground woman has more detailed shading and texturing, notably in her clothing and the glass she holds. This contrasts with the less detailed background figures, which are depicted with simpler color washes and lines, emphasizing the woman in comparison.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background figures represented with light-colored linework and faint washes rather than detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the background figures with less detail, characterized by light linework and faint color washes typical of watercolor techniques. This less detailed rendering helps maintain focus on the foreground elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the woman, combined with the delicate way she holds the glass, suggests an elegant manner. Her pose and the depiction of the glass enhance the impression of sophistication and grace.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The background figures and elements are rendered with less detail and emphasis, reinforcing the woman as the focal point of the image.",
