      "question": "Is the image formatted as a cereal box design with visible box-like structure or paneling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The format of Image B does resemble a cereal box design, as it presents elements typically associated with cereal packaging such as the title 'Basketball Breakfast Blitz!' which could imply a cereal theme or brand. However, Image B does not depict a clear box-like structure or paneling associated with cereal boxes. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge, Image B does not definitively illustrate a cereal box design with visible structure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, SpongeBob's shoes do indeed have patterns that resemble cereal loops, suggesting a cereal theme.
