    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire image, including the cosmic vortex and forest landscape, rendered in the style of a stained glass window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually resembles a stained glass window with its bold outlining and segmented sections filled with vibrant colors, which are characteristics of stained glass. This is indicated by the separated color sections and dark lines that mimic the look of lead cames in stained glass art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spiral patterns of the cosmic vortex outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines resembling lead cames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic vortex features thick, dark lines that outline the spiral, similar to the appearance of lead cames used in stained glass windows, where outlines are prominent to create sections for colored glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sky and tree canopies depicted using deep, saturated colors such as deep blues, purples, reds, and greens characteristic of jewel tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses vibrant, saturated colors in the sky and tree canopies. The colors seem to include deep blues, bright pinks, and a variety of other rich tones that exhibit the jewel-like quality typical of stained glass artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the stained glass elements (including the spiral and trees) exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures that simulate light refraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B mimics a stained glass style with segmented and bold outlines, it does not feature angular, multi-faceted surfaces. Instead, the color areas are flat and smooth without textural effects to simulate refraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature soft, glowing light effects, smooth color transitions, and balanced composition that evoke a sense of calm and serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, while vibrant and colorful, is characterized more by bold, separated colors and dark outlines rather than smooth color transitions and soft glowing effects. The stained glass style it emulates creates a more striking and graphic appearance rather than one that is smooth, soft, and calming. Thus, it lacks the calm and serene quality described.",
