      "question": "Has the vase been replaced with a structure composed entirely of flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is a vase that remains visible and is not replaced by flowers. The flowers are artfully arranged around the vase, accentuating its shape but not replacing it entirely. The single, central vase from Image A, which is ornate and made of metal, is still present in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral details follow and blend with the contours of the vase's original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B are cleverly arranged around the vase to enhance its shape, creating a harmonious blend. By arranging the flowers in a manner that complements the curvature of the vase, the overall design follows and accentuates the contours of the vase, in contrast to the original configuration in Image A where the vase and the flowers were separate.",

      "question": "Does the design prioritize artistic and imaginative expression over functional realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an artistic approach where flowers are arranged imaginatively around the vase, enhancing its visual appeal and providing a creative touch. This design choice prioritizes artistic expression, as it transforms the simple presentation of a vase and flowers into a more integrated and imaginative piece, as opposed to the straightforward functional approach seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the final design present a unique and innovative interpretation rather than a conventional vase appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of flowers around the vase gives the ensemble an innovative appearance, diverging from the conventional setup where a vase and flowers are distinctly separate entities. This new interpretation turns the traditional display into something more visually integrated and unique, contrasting the straightforward composition in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed vase retain the original shape and structure while being composed of flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the original vase's structure, and the vase itself is not composed of flowers. Instead, flowers are arranged around the existing metal vase. The flowers enhance the design without altering or replacing the vase's inherent structure, unlike if the vase itself had been reconceived entirely in floral form.",
