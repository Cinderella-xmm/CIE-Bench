      "question": "Is there a ketchup bottle positioned in the lower-right corner of the image, angled slightly toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bottle filled with a red substance, likely ketchup given the context provided by the text, is situated at the bottom right corner. The bottle is slightly tilted towards the center of the image which suggests that the positioning may be deliberate to match the thematic elements and provide a visual linkage to the text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” displayed in the middle of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase “The king of flavors” is prominently displayed slightly above the center of the image. This central placement maximizes visibility, integrates well with the surroundings, and helps in making the message clear and attention-grabbing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” crafted in a glossy, ketchup-style script font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B has a glossy appearance and a script font style, resembling the smooth consistency and color typical of ketchup. This stylistic choice reinforces the theme and connects the visual element to the written message.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the letters of “The king of flavors” appear to hover in the air and subtly mingle with the mist of the forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B indeed appears to be floating above the main visual elements, blending in with the misty environment. This effect is achieved by the placement and style that give the text an ethereal feel, connecting the text visually to the background setting of the forest.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there streams of ketchup visually linking back to the opened bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visual motif of ketchup streams originating from the text “The king of flavors” and linking to the dinosaur, but they do not extend directly to the bottle. Instead, the streams appear to flow out of the letters and integrate into the image composition without a direct connection to the bottle.",
