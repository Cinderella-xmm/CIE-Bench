    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest that the scene is encased in a transparent, curved structure resembling a glass dome. The presence of visible boundaries and the way light interacts with the surface, such as potential reflections and slight distortions at the edges, indicate a glass dome enclosure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails exhibit detail including visible creases and shadows that can be associated with a papercraft material. The visual presentation appears to have textured characteristics that reflect the layered edges typical of papercraft, rather than smooth cloth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the ship structure, there is a distinctly colored blue layer that appears to be translucent and shimmers. This visual appearance is consistent with how a resin layer would mimic the ocean, capturing the light in a way that resembles water.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seagulls do not show any visible support such as fine wires. They appear to be part of the scene without evident means of suspension, maintaining a natural appearance without a static, suspended look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the ship is indeed enclosed in a diorama, it retains the original details such as the masts, rigging, and hull design. These elements are clearly visible albeit in a smaller, scaled setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue layer beneath the ship displays a shimmering effect and light reflection, characteristic of a surface texture that replicates the appearance of flowing water. This is suggested by the way light interacts with the layer's surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the curved glass dome visibly present with clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a glass dome is indicated by clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects. The curved dome-like structure surrounding the scene allows for light interactions, which are typical characteristics of a glass dome.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
