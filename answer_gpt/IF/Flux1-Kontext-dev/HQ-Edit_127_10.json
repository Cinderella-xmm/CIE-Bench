      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical or dome-shaped structure resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear visual indication that the scene is encapsulated within a glass-like spherical dome. This is suggested by the reflections and the curved edge typical of a snow globe. These visual cues, along with the common knowledge of what a snow globe looks like, confirm that the scene is enclosed within such a structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the upper tier display a detailed Paris skyline composed of buildings with metallic textures or finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The upper part of the scene in Image B shows distant buildings that form a skyline. However, they do not exhibit any clear metallic textures or finishes. Instead, they are depicted in a simplified, almost cartoon-like style typical of miniatures within snow globes, with no particular emphasis on metallic surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lower tier contain dense, vibrant green vegetation including trees, hedges, and garden elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower part of the scene in Image B features vibrant green vegetation, including trees and hedges resembling a garden layout. This is evident from the green hues and the structured arrangement of vegetation which aligns with common garden scenery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible silvery or white flake-like particles floating between the upper and lower tiers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the spherical enclosure of Image B, there are visible white and silvery dots which are characteristic of particles commonly seen in snow globes. These particles give the appearance of floating between the scene and the dome's inner surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the scene feature sculpted cobblestone patterns and classic street lamps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of Image B, particularly around the lower section of the scene, does not clearly show cobblestone patterns or classic street lamps. Instead, it exhibits garden-like pathways and structures. The circular base of the snow globe itself features decorative patterns, but they are not specifically cobblestone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers visible in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two Eiffel Towers are distinctly visible, one in the center and one slightly offset to the right. This aligns with the view of a miniature scene where elements might be duplicated or exaggerated for stylistic effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scene exhibit characteristics of a miniature 3D model, such as exaggerated perspective, reduced scale, or model-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene that strongly resembles a miniature 3D model. The exaggerated perspectives and stylized details such as tiny people and trees, model-like textures, and the overall enclosure within a glass dome give it the appearance of a scaled-down representation.",
