    "Question": "Q1: Has the refrigerator's brand logo been changed to 'Xu's Fresh Zone'?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Xu's Fresh Zone' appears prominently at the top inside the refrigerator, where a brand logo might typically be located. The placement and style of the text suggest it is intended to replace or represent a brand logo. Despite not being the actual exterior brand logo, it can be interpreted as a change in the branding visible within the fridge.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a custom label with the user’s name added on the top shelf?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase 'Xu's Fresh Zone' appears within the refrigerator at the top area. While this text could be seen as a custom label, it doesn't appear on the shelf itself but rather above it, more like a label or logo for that section. Therefore, it's not directly indicative of being on the top shelf itself.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have any additional parts of the refrigerator's design or logo been altered besides changing the brand logo?",
    "explanation": "Focusing solely on Image B, the only visible change regarding text or labeling is the addition of 'Xu's Fresh Zone'. There are no other visible modifications to the refrigerator's design or logos besides this change.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the new 'Xu's Fresh Zone' text clear and legible on the refrigerator?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Xu's Fresh Zone' is prominently placed inside the refrigerator. The text appears to be in a bold, clear font, making it easily readable against the well-lit interior background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the custom label with the user’s name placed exclusively on the top shelf of the refrigerator?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the custom label 'Xu's Fresh Zone' is located at the top area inside the refrigerator but not directly on the top shelf. Instead, it is placed above the top shelf, making it visible without being attached to the shelf itself. This means the placement is above the top shelf rather than on it.",
    "answer": "No"
