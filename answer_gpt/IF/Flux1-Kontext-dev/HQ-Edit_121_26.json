      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a softer and more diffuse texture across the image regions, including the character, background, and objects, which is indicative of painterly techniques often seen in Renaissance art. Oil-on-canvas works typically display a texture where brush strokes contribute to a softer merging of colors and details. In Image B, the combination of subdued light, and the presence of gentle transitions and blending in colors and structures reflects this painterly style.",
