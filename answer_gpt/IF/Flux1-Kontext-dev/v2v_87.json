      "question": "Is there a classic LEGO-style minifigure present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there is no visual indication of a LEGO-style minifigure. The scene prominently features an elephant and a backpack enclosed in a glass cube. Classic LEGO minifigures typically have a specific blocky shape and are made of colored plastic, which does not match any element seen in this image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the elephant in the edited image feature earthy hues accented with a rich red tone similar to the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is depicted with distinctly earthy hues that are natural for real elephants, such as brown and tan. The red tone is found in the backpack beside the elephant. There is no blending or combination of colors between the elephant's hues and the red of the backpack in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scene encased within a transparent glass cube in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the entire scene enclosed by a transparent glass cube, notably with reflections and defined edges characteristic of glass cubes. This design choice is used often for display purposes to protect and present items neatly.",

      "question": "Does the miniature rest on a matte black base with silver details in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature is resting on a base. The base is matte black, but there are no visible silver details. The text on the base is white, which is different from silver. The base seems to be simple without the metallic additions specified in the question.",

      "question": "Is there an engraved nameplate on the base reading \"African Elephant\" with biological classification information beneath in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, presents a base with the text 'African Elephant,' and beneath this, there appears to be lines of smaller text which look like biological classification information. The typography and layout suggest this is a typical presentation style for museum-like displays, supporting the answer.",
