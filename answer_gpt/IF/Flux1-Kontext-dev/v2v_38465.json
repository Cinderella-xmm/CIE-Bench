      "question": "Are the surfers replaced with pandas holding surfboards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures holding the surfboards are no longer human surfers but anthropomorphized pandas. This is evident as they have distinct panda features like black and white fur, round faces, and bear-like builds. This change from humans to pandas is a clear alteration from what can be expected in a real-world surfing scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sunset and beach setting kept intact without any changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B includes a sunset over the ocean and the beach. The lighting, color tones, and waves appear consistent with what is expected in a sunset beach scene. By examining these elements in both images, they seem unchanged between the two, with adjustments focused on the characters and not the setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original surfers, facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and B, the figures (initially, human surfers and then pandas) are standing on the beach with their backs to the camera, gazing towards the sunset. This positioning suggests contemplative or observational stances towards the horizon. Thus, the pandas in Image B are indeed positioned similarly to the surfers in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the pandas holding surfboards in their paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphized pandas possess arms that resemble those of humans, and they are shown holding surfboards. Their limbs appear to mimic human-like functionality to grasp objects like surfboards, reinforcing the notion that they hold the surfboards in their paws.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfboards in Image B have a yellow and a striped turquoise with a red centerline design, mirroring the colors observed in Image A. Despite replacing the surfers with pandas, the surfboard designs appear consistent, maintaining the same colors and stripes as in the original image.",
