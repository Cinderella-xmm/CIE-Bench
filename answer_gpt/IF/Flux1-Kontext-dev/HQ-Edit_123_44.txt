    "Question": "Q1: Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is placed within a glass display case, presented as a 3D model. The stylization is apparent through the artificial setting and the distinct edges of the aircraft, which suggest it is a model rather than a real plane. This presentation contrasts with a photorealistic representation which would strive for a lifelike depiction of an aircraft in a natural environment.",

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the aircraft oriented diagonally upward within the display case?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft maintains a horizontal orientation within the display case, mimicking level flight rather than a diagonal upward climb. The perspective does not give an impression of an upward trajectory.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the propellers of the aircraft show visual effects indicating they are spinning (e.g., motion blur or rotational distortion)?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the aircraft with propellers that appear static, as there is no visual indication of motion blur or rotational effects that would suggest spinning. The blades' positions are steady and unchanged, typical of a model display.",
    "answer": "No"
