    "Question": "Q1: Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overall structure of the building maintains the form of a traditional English manor-style house, with recognizable architectural elements like the chimneys, gabled roofs, and windows. However, the application of bright colors and the stylistic rendering that imitates an artistic style can give a cubist flair, but the building has not been replaced; only its surface appearance is altered. Therefore, the house is not composed of fragmented geometric planes but retains its overall realistic architecture, albeit stylized.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the original brick surfaces of the house replaced with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes rather than realistic masonry?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the house with a vibrant and colorful palette, and its surfaces are rendered in a way that imitates artistic styles, but the surfaces still visually reflect areas that could be construed as realistic masonry. The appearance is more stylized than a complete replacement with geometric planes as seen in cubism.",
    "answer": "No"

However, there is no clear indication of a checkered pattern overlay. Instead, the grass is rendered in solid colors with visually varied shading consistent with an expressive artistic style.",

    "Question": "Q5: Has the water reflection been transformed into a series of prismatic, angular shards that distort and fragment the image of the house and surroundings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water reflection does appear fragmented and stylized with the use of prismatic and angular forms, altering the reflection of the house and surroundings significantly. This suggests a deliberate artistic approach to creating a distorted and non-realistic reflection.",
