      "question": "Is the perfume bottle constructed entirely out of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the perfume bottle appears to have a realistic glass texture and intricate patterns, which are not typical characteristics of Lego bricks. The bottle maintains its original design, indicating it is not constructed from Lego bricks. Thus, based on the visual cues and common sense understanding of Lego construction, the perfume bottle in Image B is not made entirely of Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Is the fabric background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the background where the fabric-like elements exist. They appear blocky and have the distinct characteristics of Lego bricks, such as ridges and uniformity. In contrast, Image A features a smooth, flowing fabric surface. These observations, combined with knowledge of Lego's appearance and construction, suggest that the fabric background in Image B is recreated using Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and positioning of the perfume bottle and fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image A, the perfume bottle is placed on a soft, undulating fabric surface. In Image B, the bottle is positioned within a framed, structured environment with a distinctly different background constructed with Lego bricks, altering the original composition and surrounding elements. This indicates that the edited image does not maintain the original composition and positioning.",

      "question": "Are the details of the perfume bottle, including the cap and spray mechanism, accurately represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the perfume bottle retains its realistic features such as the glass texture and intricate cap, which are not typical of Lego bricks. The detailed elements, such as the cap's geometric design and the spray mechanism, appear authentically preserved from Image A. Therefore, these details are not represented using Lego bricks in Image B.",

    {

      "question": "Is the stop-motion diorama style consistently applied to both the perfume bottle and the fabric background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric background and surrounding context are constructed with Lego bricks in a diorama style, creating a staged environment. However, the perfume bottle itself remains in its original realistic form rather than being adapted to the Lego styling. This inconsistency indicates that the stop-motion diorama style is not applied to both the perfume bottle and the fabric background.",
