      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the waterfall and surrounding rocks visibly transformed into the shape of an aquatic dragon emerging from the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue of an aquatic dragon is formed by the addition of a blue dragon-like shape intertwined with the water. This shape resembles the traditional depiction of a dragon, with distinct features like the elongated body and serpentine outline. The dragon seems to be emerging amidst the waterfall, but the rocks and water are not individually shaped or transformed into the dragon's body in a physical sense; instead, the dragon is an overlay within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the flowing water appear as a shimmering, translucent mane extending from the dragon’s head or neck area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon-like form does not show the flowing water becoming a mane; rather, the water continues to fall naturally while the blue dragon shape is superimposed on it. Although the water is part of the environment around the dragon, it does not extend as a mane from the dragon’s head or neck.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocks reshaped into a scale-armored body structure that forms the torso or limbs of the dragon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks remain unchanged in terms of shape and do not take on the characteristics of a dragon's scale-armored body or limbs. The visual appearance of a dragon does not come from a transformation of the rocks, but instead from the digital overlay of a dragon image onto the original photo.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the white foam areas form two distinct, misty cloud-like wings attached to the dragon’s back or sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white foam of the waterfall does not specifically form distinct wings. The foam continues to appear as splashing water without creating defined, cloud-like wing structures attached to the dragon's form.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing blue runes visible along the dragon’s scales, appearing as luminous symbols or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible glowing blue runes or symbols on the dragon's form. The dragon itself is a glowing, blue shape added to the image, but it lacks detailed luminous patterns or symbols typically associated with runes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image convey a mystical atmosphere through glowing effects, translucent textures, or ethereal lighting around the dragon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image conveys a mystical atmosphere primarily due to the glowing blue dragon shape superimposed on the waterfall. The ethereal lighting effect is achieved by the bright, blue color and the integration into the natural setting of water, which enhances the fantastical appearance.",
