      "question": "Has the overall image been transformed into a postcard-style composition with a romantic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a design that resembles a postcard. The inclusion of floral elements around the corners and sides of the image, which frame the central figure, and the pastel color palette contribute to defining it as having a romantic aesthetic. This design mimics a standard postcard layout, typically featuring decorative elements and a picture, lending to a romantic and delicate appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are asymmetrical floral patterns visible in the image, particularly on one side of the gown or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, decorative floral patterns are present along the edges of the card and are more pronounced on one side, creating an asymmetrical design. These patterns frame the central figure and contribute to the aesthetic of the postcard, where decorative elements often enhance the visual appeal of the edges or borders.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible pastel-colored lace overlay applied to the image, particularly on the dress or surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress retains its lace elements, similar to Image A. Additionally, the overall image uses pastel colors, including the veil's subtle coloring and the floral border features, but the overlay is most prominent on the border rather than the dress. Thus, while there are pastel tones in the lace of the veil, it's less about an overlay and more about the natural coloring of components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the womanâ€™s pose show her hands gently clasped or positioned as if holding a bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands are positioned as if holding a bouquet, which is visibly added to the composition. This change from Image A indicates an altered pose explicitly designed to hold the bouquet, signifying a bouquet-holding position typical in wedding or romantic portraits.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are watercolor effects in light pink and cream tones visibly applied across the image, creating a soft, painted appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays elements, particularly in the floral borders and background, that seem rendered with a watercolor effect. The soft and subtle blending of pink and cream tones around the floral decorations and background supports the perception of a watercolor painting style, adding a delicate and artistic touch to the postcard.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image have visible embossed edges, suggesting a raised border around the postcard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border of Image B does not exhibit visible embossing or shadowing effects that would indicate a physically raised edge typical of embossed postcards. The outlined box around the image resembles more of a flat, decorative frame without texture suggesting embossing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the postcard visually enclosed within a delicate paper sleeve, such as a light-colored, textured frame or envelope-like border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image appears to have a background that suggests a plain paper-like frame or border, resembling a sleeve or inner border typical of a postcard being placed within an envelope-like display. This framing effect gives an organized, completed look like it is ready for mailing or presentation.",
