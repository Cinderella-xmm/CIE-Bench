      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the body of each elephant been transformed into an elegant, curved bottle shape with a defined neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of a bottle-like top where a cap is visible, the elephants' bodies retain their original elephantine shape, including legs and trunk. There is no defined neck that typically signifies a bottle structure. The transformation seems more of an addition of a cap than a full bottle conversion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the elephant's ears now shaped like gold-trimmed caps positioned at the top of the bottle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears remain in their typical position on the sides of the head, maintaining their natural appearance and structure. The caps, which seem to be part of the bottle-like appearance, are located on top of the elephants' backs rather than replacing the ears. Therefore, the ears are not functioning as caps.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants been replaced with a glass mosaic pattern composed of small reflective tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a pattern on the elephants' backs that appears to be a mosaic made up of smaller, reflective tiles, which differs from the original glittering texture in Image A. The tiles are arranged in an orderly manner, contributing to a polished look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly visible brand logo placed along the trunk of each elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, no brand logo is visible along the trunk of either elephant. The trunk remains unmarked and the distinct branding elements such as logos are typically more prominently positioned, but in this case, they are absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a minimalist label with a fragrance name visible on the body of each bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are enhancements to the appearance of the elephants which imitate upscale perfume bottles, there is no visible text indicating a brand name or fragrance. Such labels are typically placed in visible areas to communicate the fragrance, but here it appears absent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image present a cohesive, high-end luxury aesthetic consistent with premium fragrance packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays elements typical of high-end luxury products, such as glossy surfaces, gold accents, and the mosaic pattern. The presence of caps further enhances the impression of luxury fragrance packaging, as such designs are consistent with premium aesthetics in the fragrance industry.",
