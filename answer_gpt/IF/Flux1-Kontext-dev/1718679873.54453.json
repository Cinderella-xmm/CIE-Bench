    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the robot now a miniature 3D articulated model instead of a full-sized giant robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is displayed inside what appears to be a glass enclosure, suggesting it is a miniature version rather than the full-sized giant from Image A. The context of the enclosure and the scaled surroundings are cues that it is a smaller model intended for display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robot enclosed within a circular display case?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot inside a transparent sphere, indicating it is within a circular display case, typical for showcasing models or figurines.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible indications of tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface; the robot's surface remains consistent with its original armored design without such details.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display positioned on a hexagonal black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the display in Image B is observed to be rectangular in shape rather than hexagonal, which is evident from the clear structure supporting the glass enclosure.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model number 'MODEL 393' is visible on the base, but it appears to be written in white font rather than luminous silver, as reflected by the contrast with the dark base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a miniaturized landscape around the display that reflects the original scene’s elements (e.g., trees, terrain, distant city)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the scene from Image A encapsulated within the display, maintaining elements like trees, terrain, and a distant city, albeit miniaturized to fit the spherical enclosure with the robot.",
