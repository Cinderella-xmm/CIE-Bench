      "question": "Does the airplane appear as a stylized 3D cartoon version with chibi characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is depicted with exaggerated cartoon-like features, including oversized and expressive eyes, a smiling mouth, and a stylized body design. These features are characteristic of chibi style, a form of art where characters have oversized heads and other cutesy, exaggerated features. The analysis is based on visual cues that resemble common attributes of chibi art, resulting in a decisively cartoonish and playful rendition of the airplane.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is adorned with large, oversized eyes that are positioned near the cockpit area, and it also features a broad, cheerful smile on the front, typically where the nose of the airplane would be.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the airplane in a rich red color scheme with elegant golden patterns across the body that resemble traditional motifs, such as dragons and phoenixes, which are often used in festive and cultural contexts in Chinese art.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no tassels visibly hanging from the wings of the airplane. Instead, the visual focus is on the airplane's altered design and the surrounding elements like floating lanterns. The absence of tassels or similar decorative hangings directly from the wings is clear upon close inspection.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible '囍' character, which is a specific Chinese symbol for double happiness, present on the tail of the airplane.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the background features a sky with a warm, golden hue, indicative of a sunset or sunrise setting. This atmospheric effect is supported by the low sun position and the surrounding warm lit environment, which is characteristic of a golden hour scenario.",
