      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head is fully within the boundaries of the frame. There is no observable extension of any part of the cat's head that goes beyond or touches the edge of the image frame. This assessment is based on the visual observation that the image neatly contains the complete head of the cat, without any parts cut off by the frame edges.",

      "question": "Does the curled tongue show clear spatial depth, giving a 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the cat in Image B shows the cat's tongue curled upwards and visibly protruding from its mouth. The tongue's positioning, shadowing, and slight curvature provide a sense of depth, contributing to a three-dimensional effect. This perception is grounded in an understanding of how light and shadow create depth, and the tongue's visual distinction from the flat plane of the cat's face.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the position and angle of the cat’s head create a visual illusion of peeking out from the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned centrally with its head clearly within the confines of the frame. Its pose is not suggestive of peeking out, as the full face is visible, parallel to the camera frame, not angled or turned in a manner that would suggest a peeking effect. The framing and the clear display of symmetrical facial features prevent any illusion of the cat peeking.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a natural appearance for the cat, aside from the instructed modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to maintain a natural look for the cat, with realistic coloration, lighting, and textures consistent with how a cat would appear in natural light. The lighting highlights the fur texture, and the expression aligns with typical cat behavior, reinforcing a natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edits seamlessly integrated with the rest of the image, with no noticeable artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements such as lighting, shadow, and texture are consistent throughout the image, including the edited tongue. There are no visible discrepancies in the pixelation, color blending, or other visual areas that would suggest artificial editing artifacts. The seamless integration is suggested by the uniformity in style and quality across the image.",
