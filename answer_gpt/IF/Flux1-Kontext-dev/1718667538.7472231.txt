    "Question": "Q1: Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger figure is represented in a style that resembles cut-paper or illustration, with clear and defined edges. Unlike realistic shading that blends colors smoothly to simulate three-dimensional form, this style uses flat colors with no gradient transitions, maintaining a two-dimensional appearance. This portrayal lacks the depth and complexity of realistic rendering, confirming the cut-paper style characteristic.",
