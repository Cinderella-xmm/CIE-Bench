      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle design, with the overall object now resembling a candle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show that the object maintains the structure of a teapot, but the addition of a wick-like element on the lid and textual branding referring to it as a candle ('Eternal Elegance Candle') strongly indicate a transformation into a candle design. This suggests that the object in Image B has been repurposed to resemble or function as a candle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object now rendered with a transparent or translucent glass-like finish consistent with a candle base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the finish of the object appears to be opaque and ceramic, not transparent or translucent like glass. Candle bases are commonly made of transparent or translucent glass to allow for light diffusion, which is not evident in this image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the surface of the object exhibit a high-gloss ceramic finish instead of a metallic one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B has a high-gloss ceramic appearance, which is different from the metallic finish seen in typical teapots, suggesting a change to a ceramic-like material in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been replaced with a visible wick extending from the top of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wick is visible extending from the top of the object where a candle wick would typically be placed, indicating that the object's design has been altered to include a candle wick.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a decorative gold accent rather than retaining its original functional form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B retains its functional form with a white porcelain appearance and decorative details. It hasn't been turned into a purely decorative gold accent but rather integrated into the overall design to suit the candle concept.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a subtle floral pattern visible around the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subtle floral decoration is indeed present but not around the base; it appears on the body of the object as gold ornamental patterns. The floral elements do not appear specifically around the base in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" written in elegant script on the front of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly features the text 'Eternal Elegance Candle' prominently on the front in elegant script, matching the description provided in the question.",
