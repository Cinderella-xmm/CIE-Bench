      "question": "Does the packaging resemble a Funko Pop figure box in design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging has a design similar to that of a typical Funko Pop box. It features a window showing the contents inside, a cartoon character illustration, and a large, bold number indicating a series number. These elements are characteristic of Funko Pop figure packaging, which is designed to showcase the figure inside while also providing a distinctive collectible look. The use of a speech bubble and the overall style reinforce this resemblance.",

      "question": "Is the text \"HEALING ESSENTIALS\" visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a package with the text \"HEALING ESSENTIAL\" displayed prominently on the upper part of the box. The text is clear and uses a bold, sans-serif font which is emphasized by its position and contrasting color against the blue background.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the packaging illustrated from an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the view of the packaging is not isometric; it is presented frontally with a slightly horizontal angle that allows both the front and part of the side to be visible. An isometric perspective would involve a three-dimensional view from an angle where the object is rotated to show more of its spatial depth and dimension.",

      "question": "Does the bandage inside the packaging have a chibi-style representation with oversized stitching and a cartoonish adhesive area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bandage inside the packaging is shown as a regular bandage without exaggerated or cartoonish features. There is no visual indication of chibi-style representation, oversized stitching, or a cartoonish design of the adhesive area. Chibi-style typically involves exaggeration of features, which is not present here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a realistic version of the bandage displayed outside the packaging, showing intricate details like fabric texture and adhesive surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bandage outside of the packaging that appears uncomplicated and aligned with the representation of a standard bandage, but it lacks intricate details like visible fabric texture or specific adhesive surfaces. While the style complements the packaging, it does not reach the level of realistic detail that highlights fabric texture or adhesive intricacy.",
