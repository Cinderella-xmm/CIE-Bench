      "question": "Do the bottle, opener, and glass appear to be modeled out of textured clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle, glass, and opener exhibit a uniform, matte texture with rounded edges that suggest a sculpted appearance characteristic of clay models. The surface lacks the reflective quality typical of glass or metal, and the detailing, such as the lattice on the bottle, appears simplified compared to real-life materials. These visual cues, aligned with common knowledge of clay's texture, lead to the conclusion that these objects are modeled to appear like textured clay.",

      "question": "Is the warm and inviting fireplace setting preserved in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blurred background with what appears to be a representation of a lit fireplace. The presence of flames and a consistent color palette of warm browns suggests continuity of an inviting ambiance. Although simplified, the key elements of warmth and fireplace-like imagery are retained, suggesting that the warm and inviting setting is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the original materials of the bottle, opener, and glass been replaced with a clay-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comparison, Image A presents the bottle, opener, and glass with realistic textures: the glass is transparent, the bottle looks crystalline, and the opener is metallic. Image B, however, shows all these objects with a matte, opaque, and soft appearance, indicating the adoption of a clay-like texture instead of their original materials.",

      "question": "Does the overall scene resemble a handmade claymation scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements, including the bottle, glass, and even the background, reflect the stylized and sculptural appearance common in claymation. The soft tones, simplistic shapes, and uniform texture give the impression of a handcrafted model environment, typical of claymation scenes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B use a warm color palette with browns and oranges that evoke a cozy atmosphere. Despite the shift in texture and material in Image B, the lighting and color choice remain consistent with the original's ambiance, maintaining the scene's inviting warmth.",
