      "question": "Is the couple depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated facial features and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple is represented with stylized, cartoon-like proportions typical of illustrated cards or animations. The figures have simplified facial features and a more playful, exaggerated appearance compared to lifelike depictions, which aligns with a cartoon style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the beadwork on the bride’s gown been enhanced to appear more elaborate or exaggerated than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the beadwork on the bride’s gown appears intricate but not particularly exaggerated. In Image B, however, the style is more illustrative and simplified, which may not accurately depict elaboration but rather uses artistic simplification. Thus, while the beadwork is present, it does not seem more elaborate than in the original context, only differently stylized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the groom’s suit lapel been enlarged to an exaggerated size compared to its original proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the cartoon style generally involves stylization and exaggeration in features. However, from the visual analysis, the lapel size does not appear to be significantly exaggerated in comparison to Image A. The lapel is proportionate and consistent with possible stylistic choices without significant exaggeration in size.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there three distinct scenes showing the couple holding hands, toasting, and dancing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple scenes depicted: one showing the couple holding a bouquet and posing, another showing a toast, and others that may imply a narrative typical of wedding events. However, there is no clear depiction of a dancing scene, just various poses, resulting in fewer than three distinct scenes involving these specific actions.",

      "question": "Is each of the three scenes enclosed in a heart-shaped border with a gold trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only a single central heart-shaped border with gold trim is used to frame all scenes collectively. This framing does not separate each scene individually but provides a unified frame. Therefore, they are not individually enclosed in separate heart-shaped borders.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is each framed scene placed on a cream-colored background featuring floral engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows framed scenes collectively within a decorative design. While the background does have decorative elements and borders, they are not placed independently within a cream-colored floral engraved setup. The design uses a single centralized decorative frame for all scenes.",
