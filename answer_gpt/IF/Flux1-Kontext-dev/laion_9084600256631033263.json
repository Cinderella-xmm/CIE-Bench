      "question": "Has the body of the car been transformed into a sleek, silver glass bottle that reflects the original car's curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car maintains its metallic surface and design as a classic car; it has not been transformed into a glass bottle. The car's body is consistent with traditional car materials, specifically metal and paint, rather than glass, which is evident from its appearance and how light reflects on its surface. The visible parts like the hood, doors, and overall design do not exhibit any glass-like transparency or smoothness typically associated with bottles.",

      "question": "Have the original headlights been replaced with faceted glass stoppers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headlights of the car are still intact, appearing as traditional car headlights with a conventional glass cover and reflective backgrounds. There is no indication that they have been replaced with faceted glass stoppers, which would give the impression of a crystal-like appearance or a stopper-like structure. The headlights retain their classic design rather than being transformed into decorative elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid on top of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an object that resembles a chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid on top of the car. This object is not a standard car part but is reminiscent of a decorative element. It appears distinctly as a circular, gear-like structure sitting on the car roof, which is not typical for a regular car design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Datsun 1600 emblem embossed on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Datsun 1600' emblem is visible on the side of the car, rather than the front, which is typical for car branding placement, not specifically for decanters or other objects. This emblem placement is consistent with how classic cars display their branding, and there has been no transformation of this emblem into a different format or place, like on a decanter.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the decanter design combine vintage styling (such as classic curves or script) with modern branding elements (such as clean lines or minimalist text)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still depicts a classic car, not a decanter, so we must interpret its design. The car design integrates vintage styling with elements like chrome details and classic curves. The replacement of the emblem and addition of the gear-like object introduces an element of modern design, suggesting a blend of new and old styles, but this pertains more to the modifications on the car than a typical decanter design.",
