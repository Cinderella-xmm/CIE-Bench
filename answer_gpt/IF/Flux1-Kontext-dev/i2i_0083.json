        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we see that there is a large frame on the wall which appears to contain an artwork depicting a scenic view with palm trees, a lake, and a bright sky. The presence of this frame and painting confirms that a painting is present on the wall. It's important to consider that textures and elements signify an artistic representation rather than a digital screen or real-time image. Hence, there is a painting still on the wall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues such as the vibrant colors, brushwork appearance, and scenic composition suggest it is an artwork. There is no indication of pixels or technology elements common in digital screens. The image is artistic rather than technological, hence it remains a painting, not a digital display.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still depicts a painting as described, showcasing vivid colors and a serene landscape scene. The artistic nature lacks digital screen features and does not indicate any real-time imagery. The characteristics match an artwork rather than a digital display or real-time graphics.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The framing and location remain consistent with the original, indicating that what appears in Image B is in the same spot as in Image A. There is no evidence of a digital screen replacing the painting, hence the painting remains in the same location.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing both images, we note that both feature a painting on the wall, maintaining room aesthetics like equilibrium between the frame and furniture. No digital screen has been added, so the original balance with the painting is preserved.",
