        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is filled with a large explosion characterized by bright orange and yellow flames and rising smoke. These are hallmarks of explosive effects typically seen in battlefield scenes. The presence of debris, such as a broken artillery piece seen in the foreground, further supports the interpretation that the backdrop represents a battlefield environment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands prominently in the foreground with vivid colors and strong outlines against the fiery background.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The integration quality in Image B appears less seamless due to the contrasting art styles between the character and the background. The character has a sketch-like appearance, while the background is more photographic with high-contrast flames. This creates a visual dissonance that indicates a less seamless integration.",
