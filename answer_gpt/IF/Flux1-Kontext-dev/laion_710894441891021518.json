      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches of the bonsai tree do not literally form butterflies, but the butterfly-like creatures added have wings with glowing, luminescent patterns.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while pink blossoms are present, their positioning resembles typical flowers on a bonsai rather than being specifically arranged as eyes or antlers that glow. The glowing aspect seems more attributed to the added butterflies than the blossoms themselves.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pot is depicted as having detailed, intricate carvings on its surface, characteristic of stone craftsmanship.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trunk of the bonsai retains a natural look resembling typical bark textures. While it may have been enhanced for a more artistic appearance, it does not visually resemble flowing robes, which are typically smooth and fabric-like in appearance.",
