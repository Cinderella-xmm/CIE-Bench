      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits characteristics of a minimalist flat illustration, which includes simplified shapes, block colors, and removal of intricate details. This style is often used for stickers, as seen in the thick outlines and uniform color areas.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A thick white outline surrounds the figures in Image B, a common feature in sticker design to help separate the illustration from any background and enhance contrast.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a transparent background; it has a gradient grey background, indicating that it is set against a solid backdrop rather than transparent.",
