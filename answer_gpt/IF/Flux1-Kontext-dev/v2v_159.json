      "question": "Have the shoes been increased in size while keeping their original design intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the shoes appear slightly larger compared to what might be expected of typical human proportions relative to the legs. Their design, however, remains consistent with a standard athletic shoe style, featuring a lace-up top, a rounded toe, and distinct color blocks which match their overall design. In Image A, the shoes are similarly designed, but the edited image gives an impression of slightly larger shoes due to contrasting outlines and shading. This suggests that the shoes have been increased in size, while maintaining the original design.",

      "question": "Do the legs appear more cartoon-like compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents legs as simple shapes with smooth edges and clean lines, emphasizing a drawn appearance typical of cartoons. This cartoonish style is accentuated by the bold outlines and flat color treatment. In Image A, the legs have softer shading and a more textured appearance, contributing to a less stylized, semi-realistic look. Comparing the two, Image B does indeed make the legs appear more cartoon-like, as they lack the textural detail and shading seen in the original.",

      "question": "Are the feet placed on a shelf shaped like clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet are clearly depicted walking on top of white, fluffy cloud shapes, consistent with common depictions of clouds. There is no visible structure that indicates a shelf; instead, it looks as though the shoes are actually stepping on clouds, surrounded by more clouds. Image A also depicts a similar setting: feet stepping directly on clouds rather than an object resembling a shelf. The visual context of both images supports the interpretation that the feet are on clouds, not a shelf.",

      "question": "Does the overall appearance of the legs and shoes reflect a bobblehead-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains proportionate rendering between the legs and shoes, without exaggerated features or disproportionate sizes typical of bobblehead figures. A bobblehead style would involve exaggerated proportions, often with oversized heads compared to the body, which is not the case here. The shoes may appear larger in size, but they proportionately match the legs rather than suggesting a bobblehead influence. Image A similarly does not contain such traits. Thus, neither image reflects a bobblehead-style transformation.",

      "question": "Do the shoes still maintain their original design details after being resized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes retain key design elements such as lace-up features, distinct paneling, and color differentiation that align with typical athletic shoe features. The larger size does not obscure or alter these details. By comparison, Image A shows shoes with similar design features, supporting the conclusion that the original design details were preserved despite any size changes perceived. The design integrity being maintained confirms that the shoes in Image B keep their original design details.",
