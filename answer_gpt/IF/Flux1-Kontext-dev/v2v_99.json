      "question": "Is the soccer player depicted as a charming chibi-style 3D figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer player has exaggerated proportions typical of chibi design, such as a larger head and simplified features, which contributes to the charming and cute appearance that is characteristic of chibi-style figures. The body is more rounded and smaller compared to a realistically proportioned figure. This stylistic approach is evident and therefore, it confirms the depiction of the character as a chibi-style figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is captured in motion, with one leg extended forward towards the soccer ball. This pose is indicative of a kicking action in soccer. The leg and body posture clearly suggest that the character is attempting to kick the ball, as is common in football or soccer imagery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the soccer player is depicted in a chibi style, the background elements such as the soccer field, stadium, and crowd are portrayed with realistic detail. The field has natural grass texture, the stadium is large and filled with a crowd, and overall, these elements retain a realistic aesthetic that contrasts with the stylized player.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a vibrant atmosphere with bright and lively colors that highlight the energy of a soccer match. The lighting is consistent and realistic, allowing for vivid detailing in the stadium and the uniforms. The match atmosphere is lively due to this use of lighting and coloration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is placed very close to the chibi character's extended kicking leg, creating the impression that it is about to be struck. The positioning suggests imminent contact between the foot and the ball, which is congruent with the mid-kick action depicted.",
