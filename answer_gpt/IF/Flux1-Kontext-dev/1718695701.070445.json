      "question": "Is the capybara's body rendered as a polished bronze metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible surface shows a metallic texture with a bronze color which is distinct from the furry texture typically seen in a capybara. This metallic appearance indicates that the body is rendered in a polished bronze metallic surface, as opposed to the natural fur that would be expected if it were not altered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headwear shows a metallic surface with a bronze color. The details appear consistent with a helmet design rather than a knitted hat, suggesting a transformation from the fabric texture to a metallic helmet-like appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible item that appears where the sunglasses would be shows a bronze tone and form, suggesting that 'sunglasses' as initially composed in Image A are now depicted with metallic characteristics rather than typical sunglasses materials like plastic or glass.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the object does not show any engraved lines that would resemble fur patterns. The surface appears to be smooth and polished rather than detailed with engraved lines that mimic fur texture.",
