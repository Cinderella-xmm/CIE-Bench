      "question": "Is the carrot now growing inside a space greenhouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is seen inside a structure that appears to be an enclosed container with metallic frames, typical of controlled environment agriculture apparatus seen in space farming contexts. This suggests a shift from a typical outdoor garden setting to a space greenhouse-style environment, characterized by controlled conditions suited for growth in space conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include a metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber surrounding the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrot encased in a structure with metallic edges, resembling a climate-controlled chamber designed for cultivation. This type of structure is commonly used for regulating environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and air composition, especially in advanced agricultural contexts like those anticipated in space habitats.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carrot now rooted in synthetic substrate instead of natural soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, the substrate wherein the carrot is growing looks consistent with natural soil rather than being distinctly synthetic. The appearance, texture, and color of the soil-like material around the carrot do not convey a clear transition to a synthetic substrate that would have a more homogenous and processed appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the carrot appear visibly rooted in the synthetic substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the carrot is enclosed in what seems to be a technologically advanced container, the substrate still resembles natural soil. Therefore, there's no visible indication that the carrot is rooted in a synthetic substrate, as it maintains a natural soil-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has all evidence of the original outdoor garden environment been removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the entire scene where the carrot was previously in a natural outdoor setting has been replaced by a closed-space structure, indicating the removal of features typical of an outdoor garden. The enclosed metallic frame and isolated environment suggest a complete transition away from the original open garden context.",
