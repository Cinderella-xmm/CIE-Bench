        "Yes",
        "No"

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a visual style that includes distinct patterns suggesting hand-drawn textures. These details appear in the form of sketch-like brushstrokes and artistic renderings, enhancing the contortionist's silhouette with visible texture designs, which are common in artistic prints.",

      "question": "Are the hands significantly enlarged compared to the rest of the body to emphasize grip strength?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hands of the contortionist in proportion with the rest of the body.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the contortionist are depicted in a natural contortion pose. While the pose itself is dynamic, the limbs do not appear unnaturally elongated when compared to typical human proportions involved in such gymnastics. Thus, there is no visible exaggeration in leg length for dynamic effect.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
