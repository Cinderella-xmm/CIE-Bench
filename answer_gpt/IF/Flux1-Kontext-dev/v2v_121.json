      "question": "Does the image show a full-body depiction of a creature inspired by a gummy bear with a translucent, vivid green material, rounded form, and whimsical vibe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a full-body depiction of a creature that resembles a gummy bear. The creature is made of a translucent, bright green material, which gives it a playful and whimsical appearance. The shape is rounded, typical of gummy bears, indicating the creature's design is inspired by such confectionery. This understanding is derived from the visual elements of the image that clearly align with the characteristics of a gummy bear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small orb or capsule at the creature's feet, resembling a Pokéball but with a unique design using patterns and colors that complement the green and floral theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two small orbs or capsules depicted below the creature. These do not exactly resemble a Pokéball, as they lack the specific design elements of a Pokéball, such as the two-tone ball with a horizontal line. However, they do feature unique patterns and colors that match the vibrant green and floral theme present throughout the image, suggesting a complementary design.",

      "question": "Is the invented name of the creature displayed near or beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is text above and near the creature which appears to be in a stylized font. While this text doesn't clearly spell out a recognizable invented name in English, the context of the image suggests this text is meant to represent the name or description of the creature, given its placement.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elemental type of the creature, based on the gummy bear and floral design, indicated in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not explicitly indicate an elemental type as one might see in a fantasy or creature collection context. The succulent’s appearance, theme, and accompanying graphics might imply nature or plant elements, but without explicit labeling or typical elemental imagery commonly indicating such in fantasy contexts, no clear elemental type is pointed out.",

      "question": "Does the artwork resemble an entry from a fantasy creature encyclopedia, featuring crisp lines, gentle shading, and a design full of personality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a clearly delineated, stylized depiction of the creature reminiscent of illustrations found in encyclopedic entries about fantasy creatures. The lines are crisp, shading is gentle, and the overall design is vibrant and packed with character, suggesting the intent to mimic such an entry.",
