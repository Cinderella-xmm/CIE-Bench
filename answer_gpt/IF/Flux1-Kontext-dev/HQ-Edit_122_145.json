      "explanation": "There are four separate images of chibi characters in Image B.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the four chibi character images on a light pastel background, but there is no indication that this setup is a magnetic sheet or that these images are magnets; they're displayed without particular emphasis on a magnetic property.",
