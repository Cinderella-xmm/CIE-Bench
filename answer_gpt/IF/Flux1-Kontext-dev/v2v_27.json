      "question": "Does the wombat in the stickers have overly large, expressive eyes and gentle facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is depicted with features characteristic of a cartoon or 'chibi' style, which often includes large, round eyes and simplified, soft facial expressions. This style is typically used to convey cuteness and expressiveness. These traits are seen with the wombat in Image B, where the eyes are noticeably large relative to its face. This aligns with common artistic conventions for enhancing expressiveness and charm in cartoon characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows six different sticker designs, each featuring the wombat in a unique pose or position. The wombat demonstrates various facial expressions and body gestures, such as holding a pillow, sitting with a touchscreen device, and showing different hand gestures. Each sticker has a distinct and recognizable pose, which is a common feature in sticker sets to convey various emotions or actions.",

      "question": "Is the wombat wearing a fun Hawaiian shirt and straw hat similar to those in the reference image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is dressed in a Hawaiian-style shirt adorned with a floral or tropical design, and it wears a straw hat, which matches the attire seen in Image A. Hawaiian shirts are known for their vibrant patterns and are symbolically associated with relaxation and vacation, while straw hats complement this casual vibe. The similar attire in both images suggests that the edited image maintains the same theme as the original.",

      "question": "Do the stickers include bright tropical tones with hibiscus flowers, palm fronds, or fruity drink designs in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stickers adorned with bright and vibrant colors typical of tropical themes, such as aqua blues, sunny yellows, and lush greens. However, the presence of hibiscus flowers is limited to decorative elements around the characters and not extensively in the background itself. While the stickers capture the tropical aesthetic through colors and character outfits, the explicit inclusion of backgrounds featuring clear tropical motifs like palm fronds or fruity drinks is not strongly evident.",

      "question": "Are the stickers designed with a dimension ratio of 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 9:16 ratio is a vertical format often used for smartphone screens; in Image B, the layout of the stickers, which appear side-by-side in a more square format, doesnâ€™t seem to adhere to a 9:16 ratio. Each individual sticker appears more square-like rather than elongated vertically, indicating that they do not fit this particular dimension ratio commonly associated with vertical-oriented media.",
