        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Victorian Lady is portrayed in a packaging style similar to action figures or collectibles.

However, the Victorian Lady retains a realistic portrayal without features attributed to cartoons such as exaggerated expressions or simplified forms, suggesting a more realistic rendering of the clothing rather than a full cartoon depiction.",
