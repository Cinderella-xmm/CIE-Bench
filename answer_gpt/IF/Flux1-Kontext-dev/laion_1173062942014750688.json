      "question": "Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the beads are arranged in a manner that resembles a continuous, coiled form, similar to a serpent. This is indicated by the winding pattern and consistent arrangement of the beads, which suggest the formation of a singular entity rather than loose or scattered beads. Therefore, the beads appear to be part of a continuous serpent-like shape and not in a random cluster.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads are predominantly red and yellow, with intricate designs that resemble scales. The arrangement and shape of the designs contribute to a textured appearance typical of a serpent's scaly skin, providing the illusion of a scaly texture due to the patterned distribution of colors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the serpent have two blue circular features positioned as eyes at its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, blue circular features are visible on several beads throughout the serpent's body. However, none of these circles are distinctly located or emphasized as eyes at one specific end that would be considered the 'head' of the serpent. Thus, the edited image does not prominently feature two blue circular eyes at the head.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black motifs arranged as detailed, tribal-style patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases black motifs that are intricately interwoven with the red and yellow colors. The patterns have a stylized and intricate feel, reminiscent of tribal designs. These motifs are consistently present throughout the serpent's body, contributing to a detailed and ornate appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s tail extend into a long, thin, flowing form with small, dangling bead-like tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the end of the serpent shape in Image B, there is a visible extension resembling a tail composed of strings with small, pointed tips, suggesting a flowing nature rather than a tight clustering of beads. The tips have a similarity to beads and indicate a tail-like extension that flows outward.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are only the original colors (red, yellow, blue, black) used in the serpent, with no additional or unrelated colors introduced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used exclusively comprise red, yellow, blue, and black, consistent with the motifs and patterns evident throughout the serpent's body. There are no additional colors visible beyond these, ensuring the design adheres to the specified color scheme.",
