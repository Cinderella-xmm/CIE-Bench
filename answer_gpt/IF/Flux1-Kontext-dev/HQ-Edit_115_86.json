      "question": "Is the ballerina depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated proportions and a significantly larger or more voluminous tutu than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is indeed illustrated in a cartoon style, marked by simplified and stylized features.
