        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a combination of four images, where two of them display the front of the car with different grille designs. The views are clear and unobstructed, providing a full frontal view of the car. Based on this visual assessment, it is evident that at least two images show the front view clearly.",
