    "Question": "Q1: Have all five ingredients—banana, chocolate chips, butter, eggs, and flour—been converted into chibi-style illustration stickers?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, we observe chibi-style representation of a banana with arms and a face, a cluster of chocolate-like spheres, a block that resembles butter, an item resembling an egg with a face, and a cloud-like shape that could be interpreted as flour. Combining this with knowledge of common representation and ingredient iconography, it is reasonable to believe these correspond to the named ingredients.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does each chibi-style sticker of the ingredients include both an expression and an action?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the image, the banana has facial expression and gestures, the chocolate chips lack clear expressions or actions, the butter has a generic expression but shows no action, and the egg and flour have faces but no limbs to perform actions. Therefore, not all stickers include both an expression and an action.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the chibi-style illustration stickers exhibit cute design traits suitable for decorating a recipe notebook?",
    "explanation": "Chibi-style art is characterized by exaggerated features, such as large eyes and small bodies, typically designed to appear cute. The stickers in the image display these traits, with cartoonish faces and cute expressions used on all characters, making them well-suited for decorative purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are examples of the required expressions and actions (like butter doing a peace sign, banana winking) present in their respective chibi-style illustrations?",
    "explanation": "In the image, the banana is seen giving a peace sign, and both the banana and one human figure exhibit winking expressions. However, other ingredients like the butter are not showcasing any specific actions like a peace sign, though the banana does. Thus, only some of the stickers show the required expressions and actions.",
    "answer": "No"
}
