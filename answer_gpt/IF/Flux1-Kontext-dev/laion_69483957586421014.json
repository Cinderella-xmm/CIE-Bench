      "question": "Is the food processor now enclosed within a box-like packaging structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food processor depicted is seemingly contained in a box-like packaging structure. This conclusion is drawn by recognizing the straight edges, corners, and surface patterns typical of a product box, which encloses the food processor within its facade. Image A presents just the food processor without any packaging enclosure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the packaging feature a combination of metallic silver and matte black colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a packaging design that utilizes metallic silver for the central panel where the food processor and brand name appear and matte black on the sides and some areas, such as where additional product images are presented. This observation is made by noting the textured appearance and sheen on the central part, contrasting the flat black regions. Image A displays only the food processor itself without additional colors or textured packaging.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the text elements on the packaging designed using bold and modern typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text elements appear bold and modern, observing features such as thick strokes and uppercase letters, conveying a contemporary aesthetic commonly used in consumer product marketing. This stands out significantly compared to Image A, which lacks any typographical elements as it only shows the food processor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the brand name 'Waring' displayed in a prominent position on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly positions the brand name 'Waring' prominently at the top center of the packaging front and again in the lower part just above the food processor image, drawing attention due to its size and placement relative to other elements. Image A also shows the brand name on the device itself but lacks packaging context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the food processor illustrated on the packaging from an isometric angle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B offers a side view of the food processor on the packaging, but it doesn't exhibit the typical three-dimensionality characteristic of an isometric angle, which would show depth and angles on multiple sides simultaneously. This angle appears more frontal rather than isometric when assessed by comparing visual perspectives. Image A portrays the food processor from a straightforward side view.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exploded view graphics showing the disassembled components of the food processor on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes graphics on the right side of the packaging showing disassembled parts of the food processor, such as blades and containers, which are universally known as exploded views in product illustrations. These are intended to show how components fit together or are used individually. Image A does not display such graphics, as it only shows the assembled food processor.",
