    "Question": "Q1: Is the cathedral rendered as a miniature model made of warm-stained wood instead of stone?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral structure is rendered in a warm brown color characteristic of wood, with smooth, shiny surfaces typical of a stained finish. These features contrast with the dull, gray stone common in actual Gothic architecture, indicating that the cathedral is constructed as a miniature model out of wood.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the wooden cathedral model enclosed within an ornate shadow box with visible framing and a transparent front?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral encased in a rectangular frame with a glossy, brown finish, characteristic of shadow boxes. The frame's depth and presentation suggest it encloses the cathedral, and the overall visual suggests a transparent front, though not explicitly visible (due to photographic limitations), allowing visibility of the model inside.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the Gothic architectural details, including pointed arches, flying buttresses, and rose window tracery, visibly detailed and accurately represented in miniature form?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a miniature model of a cathedral that retains the intricate Gothic details—such as pointed arches and rose window tracery—evident in full-sized cathedrals, in miniature form. Despite the small scale, these details appear precise and intricately carved, indicating the model remains true to Gothic architectural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the entire cathedral model colored in warm stained wood tones, avoiding stone-gray or cold metallic hues?",
    "explanation": "The cathedral model in Image B is uniformly colored in a warm brown hue, indicative of wood, which distinctly contrasts the usual gray of stone or metallic colors. This consistent coloration signifies the model is fashioned from wood and stained to achieve a cohesive warm appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there miniature pews and chandeliers visible inside the model cathedral?",
    "explanation": "Inside the shadow box surrounding the cathedral in Image B, miniature wooden pews and chandeliers are clearly visible. These elements add realism and context to the model, suggesting an interior church setting despite the small scale of the representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a visible clock mechanism located at the back of the model, with small figures positioned along a path suggesting movement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a clock is mounted as part of the display. While the clock itself is clearly visible, the description doesn't show any complex mechanism or figures moving along a path. Hence, the presence of figures indicating movement as part of the clock mechanism is not evident.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the small figures along the clock’s path depict actions related to religious devotion, such as kneeling, praying, or processions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, miniature figures are visible in front of the cathedral model, some interacting or engaging with the scene. However, these figures do not appear to be depicted as engaging in religious acts such as kneeling or praying—the typical poses for such acts are not visible, as they seem more related to general observation and movement.",
    "answer": "No"
