      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of ukiyo-e art such as flat color areas, strong outlines, and stylized forms instead of realistic 3D rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features flat color areas, strong outlines, and stylized forms, which are key characteristics of ukiyo-e art. This art style often uses large plain blocks of color, emphasizing simple, elegant lines that give it a two-dimensional feel, as opposed to realistic 3D rendering. The design choices in Image B reflect these aspects strongly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the robes flattened into a two-dimensional, flowing pattern with visible indigo and gold coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robes appear in a distinctly two-dimensional representation, with the fabric adorned with a flowing pattern in indigo and gold. This choice in color and design enhances the stylized and decorative nature, similar to patterns seen in traditional Japanese art. The flatness and decoration are markedly different from the texture and depth often depicted in 3D renders.",

      "question": "Are the arms accentuated with dynamic, brushstroke-like calligraphic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms in Image B are outlined with strong, dynamic lines that resemble brushstrokes, akin to calligraphy. This stylistic choice is reminiscent of traditional painting techniques, where lines are bold and expressive, further adding to the artistic interpretation and less of a literal or realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Is the face depicted with soft, minimalistic, and serene outlines rather than detailed anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the face is blurred, the visible style suggests a minimalistic and serene approach to outline rather than intricate details. Such a method is consistent with traditional artistic styles aimed at evoking calm and simplicity rather than anatomical precision and complexity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is characterized by stylized clouds with wave-like shapes, creating an ethereal, decorative atmosphere. This depiction is deeply rooted in artistic styles where natural elements are represented in a more ornate and imaginative manner, diverging from realistic interpretations found in photography.",
