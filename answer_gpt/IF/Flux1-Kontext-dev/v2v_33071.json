      "question": "Has snow been added to the clock tower and the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show the clock tower covered with what appears to be snow and icicles hanging from the edges. This indicates winter weather, as snow and icicles are typically formed during this season.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the flags been replaced with icy patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows flags that exhibit pale, muted colors with patterns that are typically seen when snow or ice coats an object, suggesting an icy transformation. Thus, it looks like they have been altered to reflect icy patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the overall scene reflect a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of snow on the tower, icicles hanging from various parts, and the pale color of the flags contribute to a wintery atmosphere, often associated with colder climates.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there visible snow accumulation on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows accumulations of snow on the clock tower, particularly on the roof, ledges, and architectural features, indicating it is indeed covered in snow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the flags display distinct icy patterns that differ from the original green and yellow stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Compared to Image A, where the flags have vivid green and yellow stripes, Image B's flags display colors and patterns reminiscent of icy textures, lacking the previous vivid color scheme.",
