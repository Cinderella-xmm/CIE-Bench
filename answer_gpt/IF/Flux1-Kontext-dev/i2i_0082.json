    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the clock been designed with a metallic material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is designed with a shiny, reflective surface typical of metallic materials. The frame and the loop exhibit characteristics such as luster and a cool toned appearance, which are commonly associated with metal finishes. This differs from non-metallic materials which typically do not have such reflective properties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the badge pendant preserve the minimalist circular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B is still surrounded by a simple circular frame, maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. The frame remains unobtrusive, without excessive design elements beyond the simplicity of the circular shape, which is characteristic of minimalist styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the proportions of the clock hands been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, we observe that the clock hands in the edited image retain similar proportions in relation to the clock face as seen in the original. The lengths and thicknesses seem to be consistent, indicating continuity across the images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible feature such as a loop or hook indicating the pendant can function as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent loop attached to the top of the clock face, suggesting the ability to attach it to a chain or keyring. This loop is a typical design element to allow objects like pendants to function as keychains.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no additional elements besides those necessary for converting it into a metallic badge pendant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the essential addition is the loop for keychain functionality, and there are no extraneous elements beyond this necessary modification. The overall design remains simple and focused on its function as a pendant.",
