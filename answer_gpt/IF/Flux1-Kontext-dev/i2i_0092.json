        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phone and stand are clearly visible on the tabletop, indicating that they were not removed. The dark screen of the phone and white stand contrast with the brighter background. Based on the visual cues and common knowledge of how a phone placed on a stand appears, it's evident they are present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is set in a bright environment with a visible seaside through the window, including elements typical of a café atmosphere such as wooden tables and chairs. Combining this visual information with the common understanding of what seaside cafes typically feature, it appears the scene has been altered to reflect a café near the sea.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop and surroundings are bathed in sunlight, indicated by the shadows and highlights present. However, there are no specific reflections of the sea waves on the tabletop itself—just the general sunlight exposure and ambience. Understanding how light behaves and common reflections, it can be concluded that specific reflections are not present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes visible tables and chairs near a window with a seaside view, which are typical elements found in a café setting, especially one located by the sea. By combining these visual cues with common knowledge of café environments, the image supports a seaside café atmosphere.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a consistent perspective of a tabletop scene commonly seen in seaside café settings. The arrangement of the phone stand on the table amidst the surrounding chairs and view through the window shows a realistic orientation and composition, adhering to common photographic perspectives in such environments.",
