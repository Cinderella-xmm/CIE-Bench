    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle has a textured surface that resembles the pattern of LEGO bricks. However, upon closer inspection, there are no visible LEGO studs or distinct brick patterns typically associated with LEGO constructions. Instead, the bottle appears to be made of green translucent material, suggesting it is likely a real glass or plastic bottle rather than LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "The bottle in Image B has a green translucent appearance, which could be visually mistaken for the aesthetic of LEGO bricks. But closer observation shows that the surface does not have any specific LEGO brick features such as interlocking studs but rather an indented pattern possibly for grip, indicating that it is glass or plastic, not LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the label area composed of multicolored LEGO blocks representing the original design elements (logo, text, colors)?",
    "explanation": "The label on Image B is clearly printed with text and logos that are sharp and detailed, preserving the original design elements. It does not have the characteristic blocky or modular aspect seen in LEGO designs, but rather appears as a paper or plastic label.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cap made from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks and does it maintain a cylindrical shape?",
    "explanation": "The cap in Image B is blue and cylindrical, matching the characteristics of a typical bottle cap, but it does not exhibit the features of LEGO construction such as visible studs or modular assembly. Instead, it appears to be a standard, smooth bottle cap.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral or white background?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the bottle on a white shelf against a neutral white background, which fits the minimalist style often used for displaying objects prominently. However, since the bottle is not constructed from LEGO bricks, it is better referred to as a bottle on display.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all brand texts (e.g., \"Bacardi,\" \"Mojito,\" \"Classic Cocktails\") visibly rendered in blocky LEGO-style lettering and legible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text on the bottle's label is easily readable and appears in the typical font used by Bacardi, not resembling blocky LEGO-style lettering. The font maintains high legibility and provides a clear display of brand texts typically seen on commercial labels.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the LEGO bottle display clear sculptural features such as defined edges, depth, and 3D form to emphasize its construction?",
    "explanation": "The bottle in Image B displays a 3D form with defined edges and depth typical of a real bottle design. Despite the surface texture giving a somewhat brick-like appearance, it lacks additional features that emphasize LEGO construction such as separate or stacked brick sections. The bottle appears to be a standard bottle with distinct sculptural features rather than LEGO construction.",
    "answer": "No"
