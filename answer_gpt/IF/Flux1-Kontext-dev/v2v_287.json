      "question": "Is the train depicted as a 3D voxel model with a blocky, pixelated appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals a sleek, modern train design with smooth curves and surfaces, distinctly lacking the blocky or pixelated characteristics associated with voxel models. Instead, the train appears to be rendered with a focus on realistic proportions and curvature, which contrasts with the simplified, block-based aesthetics typical of voxel art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train's 3D voxel model use a similar color palette and design simplicity as the icons shown in the left image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of Image B does not show a 3D voxel model of the train; instead, it retains a realistic depiction that is detailed and smooth. The color palette includes realistic shading and complexity, which does not match the simple, minimalistic, blocky style typical of voxel art or the simplistic icons often used alongside such designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in high enough detail to suggest an 8k resolution, with no visible pixelation or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a high level of detail and clarity consistent with images rendered at high resolution. The textures and lighting appear smooth, and no pixelation is visible at a glance. However, this does not necessarily indicate an 8k resolution without pixel-level examination, but it does suggest a high degree of rendering precision and detail.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train's 3D voxel model exhibit clean, precise shading and lighting effects consistent with those produced by Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a 3D voxel model; it showcases a realistic image without the distinct style of voxel art. The shading and lighting appear smooth and realistic, which are characteristics consistent with advanced renderers such as Octane, even though a voxel model is not present to exhibit such effects in this scenario.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the 3D voxel model of the train retain the original train's proportions and overall shape, making it recognizable despite the stylistic change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is no 3D voxel model of the train, the image retains the realistic appearance of a train with accurate proportions and overall shape. Since the style hasn't changed to a voxel representation, the original proportions and recognizability remain unaffected.",
