        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted with distinct and bold ink outlines, separating each component clearly for the viewer.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each panel distinctly separates the activities of the characters.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, although the scene features a character wearing a green headband who appears to be engaged in an activity, there is no distinct visual representation of a gym corner. The setting suggests indoor activity rather than a specialized gym zone.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, thereâ€™s one panel showing a character seemingly nestled in a cardboard box, suggesting a cozy nook. Based on the context and illustrative style, the box serves as a clear visual element representing a nook where the character is resting.",
