      "question": "Does the robot feature streamlined, symmetrical forms with chrome or highly reflective metallic surfaces typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B displays streamlined and symmetrical forms that are indicative of Art Deco design. The surface is chrome or highly reflective, reinforcing the connection to the sleek, elegant lines and shiny surfaces associated with Art Deco style. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge of Art Deco aesthetics, support the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos depicted as stylized geometric patterns rather than realistic birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flamingos in Image B appear as realistic birds rather than stylized geometric patterns. They retain naturalistic shapes, proportions, and details similar to actual flamingos, which distinguishes them from geometric abstraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees in the background have angular, geometric forms instead of natural, curved shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B retain their natural shapes with curved trunks and leaves, not reflecting angular or geometric forms. This suggests that they are rendered more realistically rather than in stylized geometric forms typical of some artistic styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rocks in the background rendered with stylized, geometric shapes rather than natural rock formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocks in Image B have angular shapes that suggest they are stylized to some extent, differing from the rounded and eroded forms of natural rock formations. They appear to be rendered with more geometric emphasis, fitting the criteria of stylization.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a muted pastel color palette, avoiding strong or vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are vivid and not entirely muted, as they include bright pinks of the flamingos and vibrant blues of the water. This indicates the use of more vibrant hues rather than a strictly pastel palette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot positioned centrally among the flamingos, maintaining the original compositional layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is placed centrally among the flamingos, similar to the positioning observed in many compositions where the main subject is foregrounded amid surrounding elements. This placement follows a traditional compositional approach, keeping the layout intact.",
