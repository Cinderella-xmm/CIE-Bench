      "question": "Is the hot dog replaced with a model made of red, yellow, and tan LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog appears stylized with visible studs and segmented layers that resemble LEGO bricks. Additionally, the arrangement and colors—tan for the bun and red for the sausage with yellow mustard—are consistent with a LEGO construction. Using world knowledge about LEGO's distinctive look, it is evident that the hot dog in Image B is a LEGO model.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the original bottle been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the bottle has a textured surface comprised of distinct rectangular patterns in various colors and is reminiscent of mosaic art. This contrasts the smooth, transparent appearance of the original glass bottle, suggesting that the bottle in Image B has been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic object.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece feature geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle showcases a pattern consisting mainly of rectangular shapes colored in red, yellow, and blue, rather than tan. The color scheme includes red and yellow, but tan is not prominently featured, as blue takes its place. Therefore, the mosaic design does not include tan colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic piece placed on a smooth wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO hot dog is placed on a wooden cutting board, which has a smooth appearance. The mosaic ceramic bottle stands on the table without a specific base underneath, as evidenced by the visible tabletop. Therefore, while the hot dog is on a smooth wooden base, the bottle is not.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO hot dog maintain an elongated, cylindrical shape similar to a real hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO hot dog in Image B indeed resembles a real hot dog, maintaining an elongated and cylindrical shape typical of hot dogs. Despite being made of LEGO bricks, the overall form is consistent with a traditional hot dog shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece have a rounded, artistic form rather than a realistic bottle shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B, while having a mosaic pattern, retains the general shape of a standard bottle. The cylindrical form with a cap is consistent with traditional bottle designs, suggesting that its form is more realistic than purely artistic or abstract. Therefore, it is not a rounded, artistic form.",
