        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain's base is depicted as the creature's limbs. These limbs appear to blend into and overlap with the surrounding forest, enhancing the integration of the creature into the landscape and maintaining continuity with the foreground trees. However, the limbs do not specifically appear as roots intertwined among the trees but rather stand distinctly above.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground trees remain visible, providing depth to the scene.
