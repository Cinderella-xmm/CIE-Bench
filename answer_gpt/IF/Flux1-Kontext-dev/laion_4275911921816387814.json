      "question": "Is the dagger now rendered as a soft, plush toy rather than a rigid weapon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dagger is depicted with soft, plush characteristics. The fabric texture visible in the image indicates that it is a soft toy rather than a hard metal item. This conclusion comes from recognizing typical plush toy features such as fabric materials and stuffing that contribute to the softness and malleability of toys.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade appears to be composed of a silver-gray fabric with patterns resembling embroidery. The presence of stitching-like designs and the texture of fabric support the idea that the blade is soft and made from fabric.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hilt in Image B displays a texture and appearance consistent with faux ivory, commonly used in plush products. The coloration and segment-like patterns mimic ivory, but the softness of the material clearly implies fabric construction typical of plush items.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the plush dagger appear soft and rounded. This is typical of plush toys where stuffing smooths out any harsh angles, ensuring a safer and softer edge compared to hard, sharp materials.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the dagger with obvious signs of stuffing, such as visible volume and softness. The contours are less defined, consistent with items filled with soft materials that lead to a rounded, voluminous appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop is solid-colored, serving as a neutral canvas that enhances the visibility of the plush dagger. This simplicity is common in product photography to prevent distraction from the primary subject.",
