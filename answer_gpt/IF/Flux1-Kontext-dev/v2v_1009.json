      "question": "Is the bowl made of a transparent glass-like material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl appears opaque and is likely made of ceramic or a similar material. Based on the visual cues, such as the smooth and solid surface, it lacks the transparency characteristic of glass. Therefore, combining these observations with world knowledge, the bowl is not made of glass-like material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vegetables have a fresh and slightly damp surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture of the vegetables, particularly the carrots and cauliflower, appears shiny and slightly moist, suggesting freshness. This is inferred from the highlights and the sheen visible on the surface, which are often associated with freshly cut vegetables.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image show angled lighting from above with soft ambient fill, creating highlights and soft shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits lighting coming from an angle above, as evidenced by how the highlights and shadows are distributed on the vegetables and the bowl. The lighting is soft, creating gentle shadows rather than harsh contrasts, indicative of ambient fill light. This analysis combines visual cues with lighting techniques commonly used in photography.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a neutral gray with a subtle vignette gradient and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a uniform light gray color, appearing smooth and without any noticeable gradient or vignette effect. This suggests a plain surface rather than a specifically designed vignette background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the vegetables naturally vibrant with a soft glow effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the carrots and cauliflower are vivid and bright. The orange of the carrots and the white of the cauliflower show a natural vibrancy that is visually appealing, and there is a soft glow effect present as illustrated by the lighting highlights on their surfaces.",
