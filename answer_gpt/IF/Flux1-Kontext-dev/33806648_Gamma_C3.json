      "question": "Does the edited image depict the rock arch as a recognizable stone guardian creature with anthropomorphic or guardian-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rock arch has been transformed visually with the addition of a dragon-like creature that has distinctive features such as wings, a face with eyes and a mouth, and a central glowing orb on its body. These features give it an anthropomorphic essence and create an impression of a guardian entity within the rocky structure. This combines knowledge of dragon mythology and typical guardian symbols, allowing one to conclude that it is depicted as a guardian-like creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible crystalline structures growing along the curved edges of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any crystalline structures or formations that can be identified along the arch. The visual additions are mainly focused on the dragon-like creature and its features, without any evident crystalline elements attached to the edges of the arch itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vein-like lines running across the surface of the arch that follow naturalistic branching patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual effects added to the dragon imagery exhibit glowing patterns that resemble vein-like lines. These lines extend across the dragon's figure, branching out in a manner that suggest dynamic energy flows, which is a familiar pattern for depicting radiance and energy in digital art rather than naturalistic vein-like patterns. Thus, these lines are a part of the creature rather than the arch itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original arch outline been replaced with skeletal, wing-like protrusions extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wing-like protrusions, but they are part of the dragon-like creature incorporated within the arch, rather than replacing the outline of the arch itself. The wings emerge from the creature in the arch but are not part of the structure itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there clearly visible runic symbols engraved or etched onto the inner surface of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no runic symbols visible on the rock surface of the arch. The visually altered parts include the dragon and its integrated features. The surface of the arch itself remains unchanged with no visible runes or engravings added.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a glowing orb positioned centrally within the arch, acting as a source of radiance and energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features a glowing orb located at the center of the dragon-like creature associated with the arch. This orb has a radiant effect, emitting light from its position, fitting with the description of it acting as a source of energy and radiance.",
