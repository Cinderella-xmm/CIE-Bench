    "Question": "Q2: Has the beadwork on the bride’s gown been enhanced to appear more elaborate or exaggerated than in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the beadwork on the bride’s gown appears intricate but not particularly exaggerated. In Image B, however, the style is more illustrative and simplified, which may not accurately depict elaboration but rather uses artistic simplification.
