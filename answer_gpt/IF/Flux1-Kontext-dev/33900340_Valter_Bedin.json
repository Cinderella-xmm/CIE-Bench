      "question": "Does the edited image depict the medieval structure as a colossal stone golem with a humanoid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of humanoid features, such as large arms emerging from the stone structure, suggests the castle is transformed into a golem. The arms and central positioning of symbols on what can be interpreted as the chest area contributes to the depiction of the structure as a humanoid form. This transformation from a static structure to a living-form entity characterizes the image as featuring a colossal stone golem.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the archways visibly transformed into articulated limbs resembling arms or legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays clearly articulated limbs that resemble arms coming out from the central part of the structured form. The design and positioning imply these are arm limbs, contributing to the overall transformation of the structure into a humanoid form, which is consistent with articulated limbs of a golem.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the battlements at the top of the structure resemble a crown-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the battlements on top of the structure maintain their original shape but when scrutinized within the context of the transformed stone golem figure, they can resemble a crown-like shape, fitting the thematic transformation of the structure's top into something akin to a majestic or royal headgear, further enhancing the golem imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are glowing ancient glyphs visible across the surface of the structure, replacing the original wall texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features glowing symbols or glyphs across parts of the structure, which replaces the uniform stone texture seen in the original image. These glyphs adorn the architecture, giving it a mystical aura unlike the neutral, non-illuminated stonework seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the stone golem silhouetted against the sky with a mystical aura emanating from its shadowed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and glow from various parts of the stone golem suggest a mystical aura, but the golem itself is not silhouetted against the sky. Instead, it stands prominently among the shadows, illuminated by glyphs, blending the aura and golem rather than creating an isolated silhouette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the small human figure been replaced by a luminous, ethereal wisp-like entity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the human figure emanating a distinct luminous glow, giving it an ethereal look, transformed from the non-glowing human figure in Image A. However, the figure maintains its form and does not fully resemble a wisp-like entity, rather it appears as a human with a mystical illumination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible ethereal effects such as soft glows, light particles, or magical ambiance added to the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several ethereal effects, such as glowing glyphs and a luminous human figure, contributing a magical ambiance not seen in Image A. These enhancements transform the scene from a mundane castle image to one filled with mystical and magical attributes.",
