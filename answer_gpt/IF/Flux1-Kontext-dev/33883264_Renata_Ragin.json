      "question": "Has the Brooklyn Bridge been transformed into a colossal, humanoid stone golem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Brooklyn Bridge is no longer visible in its usual form. Instead, there is a large humanoid figure standing on a base, which visually appears to be made out of stone. This transformation suggests that the bridge has been altered to resemble this golem-like figure. The details and context of the bridge in terms of scale and location support that it has become part of the golem.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the twin spires of the Brooklyn Bridge been reshaped into arms extending from the golem's shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are not visible as they traditionally are. The golem has clearly defined arms extending from its shoulders, suggesting an artistic alteration of the bridge's towers to form these arms. This represents a significant alteration from architectural elements to humanoid features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bridge's cables depicted as sinewy tendons wrapped around the golem’s broad chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the iconic cables of the Brooklyn Bridge are still present but have been integrated into the golem’s design. They appear across the chest area of the humanoid figure and resemble tendons or muscular structures rather than merely architectural cables.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the Freedom Tower been transformed into a tall, crystalline crown positioned on the golem's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the golem's head features a structure resembling a crown, with vertical elements that mimic the appearance of the Freedom Tower. Although the Freedom Tower itself stands in the background, the altered visual relationship suggests a transformation of its motif into part of the golem’s design, reflecting a crystalline crown.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the surrounding skyscrapers been transformed into intricate armor plating covering parts of the golem’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding skyscrapers remain in the background, and there is no evidence within the image that they have transformed into armor on the golem. The golem itself does not exhibit elements that resemble typical skyscraper features as armor plating.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the golem stand in a majestic, upright, and firmly anchored stance, dominating the cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem is depicted standing upright and firmly positioned on a platform, towering over the scene. Its gigantic size and position give it a dominant presence over the cityscape, fitting the description of a majestic stance as it overshadows other elements within the image.",
