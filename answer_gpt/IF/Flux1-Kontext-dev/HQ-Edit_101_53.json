    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug is portrayed with a very smooth texture, lacking the distinct fur details seen in real animals. The shine and uniform surface are characteristics of carved materials, such as wood. This portrayal resembles a sculpture more than a living creature, indicated by the idealized and polished appearance typical of wood carvings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the pug's surface is notably smooth, with no visible fur texture. Instead, it displays a sheen and uniformity consistent with a polished wood grain, further emphasizing that the pug is a sculpture rather than a real dog.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pug in Image B maintains a similar color pattern to what you would expect in real pugs, with lighter and darker tones reminiscent of walnut wood, which has a warm and deep hue. This consistency with authentic pug coloration while using walnut-like tones aligns with the idea of a wooden sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug's facial features, like wrinkles, are defined by precise markings that resemble etching or carving. These lines suggest a hard material, characteristic of carved surfaces, rather than the soft and pliable skin folds seen in living animals.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is indeed simple and black, supporting the sculptural pug. It's a plain pedestal commonly used to showcase sculptures, highlighting the wooden pug, which aligns with typical presentation methods for crafted artwork.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
