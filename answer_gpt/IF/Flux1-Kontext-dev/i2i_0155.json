        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is text at the top left corner that clearly reads 'Breathe'. The placement and prominence indicate it is an intentional addition to the image. Based on this observation, the text 'Breathe' is evidently present in the top left corner.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Breathe' uses a font that is elegant and fits well with calming themes. However, there is no text that reads 'Calm' visible in Image B. The single visible text 'Breathe' employs a style that is associated with relaxation and wellness designs.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering only the text 'Breathe' in Image B, it is integrated in a way that complements the soft and serene setting of a plant by the window. The font and color choice maintain the soothing atmosphere. There's no 'Calm' text to analyze regarding blending.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Breathe' is placed at the top left corner, away from the central elements of the plant and window, ensuring they remain unobstructed and focal in the composition. There's no 'Calm' text present to consider its placement.",
