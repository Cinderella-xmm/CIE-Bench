        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual appearance is characterized by shades of gray, which indicates that it is rendered in monochrome. This means that instead of a full-color palette, the image uses various intensities of gray, which is consistent with grayscale rendering.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the event name \"Riders & Reins Expo 2024\" and the location \"Evergreen Equtran Center, Olupia, WA\" are clearly mentioned.
