      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire naval scene enclosed within a visible vintage glass lantern structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object enclosing the scene in Image B resembles a large glass jar or bottle rather than a glass lantern. The jar contains the ship, dock, and surrounding elements, making it appear as a miniature diorama inside a glass vessel. Glass lanterns typically have metal frames and are meant to hold lights, whereas this is clearly a cylindrical glass container similar to a bottle.",

      "question": "Does the ship feature brass-colored finishes and visible rotating gears as part of its mechanical design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship indeed has a brass-like color, suggesting metal finishes typical of steampunk aesthetics. However, there are no visible rotating gears; instead, the ship maintains its original structural design only with a brass color.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the figures on the dock replaced with metal automatons wearing Victorian-style attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B appear to be the same as in Image A, with no change to metal automatons or Victorian-style clothing. They retain the appearance of regular people in casual attire walking on the dock.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a visible white cloud near the ship's chimney, which can be interpreted as steam. This feature suggests the presence of movement or operation within this enclosed environment, contributing to a dynamic atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an oversized compass visible on the inner wall of the glass jar, and the ship displays stylized maritime flags. These elements are exaggerated and contribute to the nautical theme by providing depth and historical context, fitting within the vintage steampunk style.",
