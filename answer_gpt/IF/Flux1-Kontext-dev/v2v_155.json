      "question": "Is the golden car depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden car has realistic proportions and details. A chibi style typically features exaggerated and rounded characteristics, often with a 'cute' aesthetic, which is not present here. Therefore, based on its appearance, the car is not depicted in a 3D chibi style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car look like it is emerging from the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is entirely within the frame that is being held by human hands. There is no indication that the car is coming out of the frame or appears to be emerging from it. Thus, the car does not look like it is emerging from the photo frame.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a human hand visible, grasping the edges of the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows two human hands on opposite sides of the frame, holding it securely. The hands are grasping the edges, indicating someone is holding up or presenting the frame.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both in Image A and Image B, the car is golden. There is no change or alteration in the color of the car in the edited image compared to the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the transition from a flat 2D space to a 3D reality clearly depicted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presentation of elements within the frame and the human hands creates a sense of depth, as if moving from a 2D plane to a 3D space. The 3D aspect is highlighted by the realistic representation of the car and its context within the frame.",
