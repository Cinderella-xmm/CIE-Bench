      "question": "Is the elephant depicted as a smaller-scale version enclosed within a transparent glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is clearly enclosed within a glass display case, indicated by the transparent walls surrounding it. This setting, coordinated with its ornamental gold armor and smaller-scale details, effectively suggests that it represents a small, model-like version within the display case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate armor details on the elephant rendered with a shiny, metallic-resin-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B has armor that reflects light in a way that seems shiny and metallic, akin to resin materials that are polished. The visual impression of the armor is consistent with metallic resin textures, which are often depicted with glossy and reflective surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there four small golden banners made of silk-like material positioned at each corner of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are golden banners visible at the top corners of the display case. However, only two such banners can be seen in the image. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed that there are four banners, as the corners not shown do not display additional banners.",
