      "question": "Has the subject been transformed into a kawaii enamel pin style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the hair has been stylized in a way that resembles a cartoon or caricature style commonly seen in enamel pins. This style is often characterized by simplified features and bold outlines, which match the overall feel of the image. The choice of colors and clear delineation are consistent with kawaii design, which is cute and playful. Thus, the subject appears to be transformed into a style that mimics kawaii enamel pins.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there glossy metal outlines present on the pin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines are bold but do not exhibit the shiny or metallic sheen typically associated with the glossy metal edges seen in enamel pins. These outlines appear flat and colored rather than metallic, indicating that the pin lacks those characteristics.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pin have vibrant enamel fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coloring in Image B suggests the use of vibrant, flat colors that are typical for enamel pins where enamel is used to create strong, vivid colors. The hair, for example, has a consistent, bright shade fill which is a hallmark of enamel pins. Therefore, the pin's style does align with the vibrant enamel fill characteristic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any extra features added to the pin beyond the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, no extra design elements or features, such as logos, text, or decorative embellishments beyond the core design of the hair and partially visible attire are present. The pin design is straightforward and focused on the subject without additional adornments.",

      "question": "Is the mockup in a square format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is presented in a format that shows a combination of rounded edges around the pin design. The dimensions of the image itself appear rectangular as it showcases the edited subject, rather than a square which would imply identical length and width.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the mockup white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B clearly shows a white area surrounding the pin design, which sets off the pin's features against a neutral backdrop commonly used in mockups to highlight the design content. Given this observation, the background is indeed white.",
