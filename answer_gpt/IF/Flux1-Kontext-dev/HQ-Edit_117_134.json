      "question": "Is the grand piano replaced with a cookie sculpture that retains the same overall shape and structure as the original piano?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the piano has a distinct appearance of being a cookie sculpture, indicated by its texture and color resembling baked goods. It retains the same overall structural elements of a grand piano, like the lid, keys, and legs. Despite its edible appearance, the shape closely follows that of a traditional grand piano.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano is indeed uniformly colored in a rich caramel hue, which contrasts with the typical glossy black one expects from a traditional grand piano. The uniform color gives the impression of a baked item, akin to a cookie.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows white and gold decorative patterns on parts of the piano, which seem to mimic ornate design details typically found on an elegant piano. These designs are likely intended to resemble icing, aligning with the cookie sculpture theme.",

        "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keys in Image B appear to be consistent with the rest of the cookie piano theme. Although designed with a white and black pattern, there is no visual indication that they are made of sugar crystals specifically, rather than being part of a cookie design resembling traditional piano keys.",
