    "Question": "Q5: Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the leaf in a spherical container; its position and the visual cues suggest it is suspended in some medium. However, while it may suggest a possible liquid environment due to ripple-like textures, there are no clear indications of typical snowflake shapes drifting around the leaf inside the globe.",
