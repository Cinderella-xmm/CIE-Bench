      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dancing woman appear as if made of stained glass with distinct panel-like divisions and dark outlines resembling lead came?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a border that resembles stained glass, yet the woman's depiction does not utilize typical stained glass characteristics like panel divisions and lead outlines in her features or attire. The surrounding frame might suggest stained glass influences, but not the woman herself.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes geometric patterns in the woman's outfit but lacks flowing, curvilinear lines typical of Art Nouveau. The design appears more linear and structured rather than embodying the signature fluidity of Art Nouveau.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a sense of continuous, flowing ornamentation and balanced movement, with decorative details linking the dancer and environment in a unified design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
