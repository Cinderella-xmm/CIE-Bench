    "Question": "Q1: Is the image vertically oriented?",
    "explanation": "To determine the orientation of an image, one should observe its height relative to its width. Image B shows elements extending upwards more than horizontally, suggesting a prevalent vertical proportion. The glass box enclosing the scene further strengthens the vertical perception due to its cubical dimensions. Combing this visual information with the typical characteristics of vertically oriented images leads to the conclusion.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the image feature a Classic LEGO minifigure-style portrayal of the individual?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the individual remains life-sized with accurate human proportions, as visually evidenced by muscle definition and posture. Classic LEGO minifigures are characterized by simplified, exaggerated body proportions distinct from human anatomy.

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a dynamic and athletic animal beside the LEGO minifigure?",
