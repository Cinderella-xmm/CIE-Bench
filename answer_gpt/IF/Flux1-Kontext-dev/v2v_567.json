      "question": "Have the individuals waiting at the train station been converted into 3D chibi-style characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals at the train station appear to have been rendered in a 3D style. Characteristics of the chibi style include disproportionate, smaller, and more rounded features compared to realistic proportions. By examining Image B's characters, we can see they have significantly stylized, softened, and simplified forms compared to realistic human figures, fitting the description of chibi-style design. Hence, with a visual cue pointing to a 3D modeling style, it confirms the transformation into chibi-style characters.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style characters in the same positions as the original individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the positions of the characters in Image B, each chibi-style character appears to mimic the spatial arrangement and orientation of the individuals in Image A. Although the appearance is transformed, the spatial layout and arrangement at the station platform remain consistent between the two images. Positioning reflects careful adherence to the original setup.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style characters retain the original outfits and postures of the individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire worn by the characters in Image B matches the outfits seen in Image A, reflecting an adherence to period-appropriate clothing. Additionally, even though the characters are stylized, their general posture, facing directions, and attitudes closely replicate those in the original image. The transformation focuses on style without altering the outfits and postures significantly.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the train and station backdrop remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train and station in Image B maintain structural integrity and components seen in Image A. The locomotive design, station architecture, and general scenery retain their features, indicating an unchanged or minimally altered backdrop apart from stylization effects. The similarity suggests the backdrop itself persists across both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters display 3D qualities like depth and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters exhibit clear 3D qualities, such as dimensionality, depth, and shading. These characteristics are evident through lighting effects and surface contours, enhancing their presence as 3D objects with tangible spatial depth rather than flat illustrations. The depth and shading characteristics are consistent with 3D renderings.",
