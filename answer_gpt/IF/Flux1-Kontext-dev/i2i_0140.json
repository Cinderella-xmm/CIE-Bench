      "question": "Does the image display a soft hand-painted texture characteristic of watercolor illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the visual style appears to have a soft, blended quality to the colors and edges. This is a characteristic often associated with watercolor paintings, where colors appear washed and edges are not sharply defined. This stylistic choice gives the impression that the image is hand-painted, typical of watercolor illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bedding patterns from the original image preserved in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the original image, the bedding patterns consist of distinct colorful geometric designs, notably featuring star shapes. In Image B, these distinctive patterns are still clearly visible, suggesting that the core design has been preserved despite the shift to a watercolor style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the colors in the image exhibit a soft blending typical of watercolor paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B show a transition that is smooth and less defined at the edges, indicative of the blending technique characteristic of watercolor paintings. Watercolors typically have colors that flow into one another softly, and this effect is present in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible brush stroke textures or subtle variations in shading throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents visual qualities that emulate the effect of brush strokes and the natural variation in application that you would see in a watercolor painting. The shading is subtle and varied, with areas showing slight saturation changes, leading to the presence of brush-like textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can detailed designs in the bedding, like the star patterns, still be clearly seen after conversion to the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the watercolor conversion in Image B, the detailed design elements, such as the star patterns on the bedding, remain clearly identifiable. This indicates that, although the texture and color blending have changed, the image retains the essential details from Image A.",
