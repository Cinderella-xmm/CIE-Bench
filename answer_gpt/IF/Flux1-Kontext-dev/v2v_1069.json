      "question": "Is the ceiling fan enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues, Image B features a ceiling fan that is clearly enclosed within a transparent spherical dome, resembling a snow globe. This is evident from the glassy surface with reflections and the fan being situated inside the sphere, allowing the conclusion that the fan is inside a snow globe.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest atop a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe situated on a smooth surface, likely a tabletop, under soft and warm lighting. The background is minimalistic with a warm hue, which aligns with the description of a warm and minimalist setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the snow globe emits sparkling light effects. However, there is no clear evidence of these shimmering effects being cast onto nearby surfaces outside the globe, as the sphere is the primary focus of light effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fan inside the snow globe depicted in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan inside the snow globe, as seen in Image B, maintains a realistic design similar to Image A, rather than a playful or caricatured 3D cartoon style. The design is consistent with realism, focusing on detailed metallic features rather than exaggerated or stylized elements found in cartoons.",

      "question": "Are snowflakes visible drifting gently through the air inside the tiny room within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts bright, dot-like light effects within the snow globe that may initially suggest snowflakes, but they resemble twinkling stars rather than actual drifting snowflakes. Hence, there are no visible traditional snowflakes inside the globe.",
