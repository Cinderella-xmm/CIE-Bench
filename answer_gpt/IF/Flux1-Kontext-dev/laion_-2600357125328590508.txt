    "Question": "Q1: Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the sock is visibly composed of interlocking LEGO-style bricks. The distinct characteristics of LEGO bricks, such as their rectangular shape and interlocking mechanism, are evident through the overall texture and appearance of the brick-built surface. These visual cues suggest that the sock is made entirely from LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the original black, gray, and white patterns from the sock are replicated using LEGO bricks. The distribution of colors and patterns visible on the sock demonstrate a blocky, pixelated style typical of LEGO construction, maintaining the original color scheme and design from the original textile sock.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO construction in Image B appears mostly flat, without visible variation in brick heights or layers that would create a three-dimensional appearance or depth. The sock maintains a consistent height and lacks the layered construction that would suggest significant depth.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
    "explanation": "The tag on the top of the sock in Image B retains its orange color and rectangular shape as seen on the original sock. However, there are no visual indications that the tag is made out of an orange LEGO brick piece. It resembles the original tag in texture and structure, not a LEGO brick.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO sock displayed upright on a pedestal against a plain background. This environment is clean and minimalist, resembling a gallery-like setting without visible clutter or distractions, allowing full focus on the sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
    "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the LEGO sock showcases aligned brick rows and defined edges, typical of structured LEGO builds. The construction reflects an intentional design with an architectural form, where care is taken to align bricks and maintain structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
