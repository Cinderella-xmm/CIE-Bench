    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the bed fully constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, including the frame, mattress, and base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed prominently features the characteristic studs and texture of LEGO bricks visible throughout the frame, mattress, and base. Each component of the bed, including the headboard, appears to consist of these interlocking pieces, typical of LEGO construction. This observation indicates a complete transformation into a LEGO structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are white and light blue LEGO bricks used to recreate the botanical pattern visible on the original bedding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding has designs that mimic the botanical pattern seen in Image A. However, Image B uses a print or overlay of light blue on the white LEGO bedding instead of constructing these patterns with individual bricks. The patterns are directly printed or represented through color application instead of brick arrangement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the headboard been replaced with smooth, curved LEGO pieces to create a rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO-constructed bed with a headboard that features smooth, curved elements. The rounded appearance is achieved by the use of LEGO pieces designed to create curvature, distinct from the straight lines and sharp angles typically associated with block-style bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pillows made from stacked smaller LEGO bricks, giving them a distinct three-dimensional structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows do not appear to be constructed from smaller LEGO bricks that could form a distinct three-dimensional structure through stacking. Instead, the pillows in Image B maintain their form more as a printed image on a LEGO base, keeping a relatively flat appearance rather than a 3D one constructed from smaller blocks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of the edited image the same grayscale as the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a grayscale background. The tones and simplicity of each background help highlight the subject without interference. Therefore, no change is recognized in the background tone or shade.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bed appear playful due to visible brick construction and structured due to orderly arrangement and clear modular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a bed constructed of LEGO bricks, visibly highlighting the playful and creative aspect typical of LEGO design. The structure maintains an orderly arrangement, common in LEGO builds, with its modular and systematic construction contributing to its overall organized appearance.",
