        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank’s treads are constructed using LEGO brick elements, characterized by visible studs and distinct blocky segments. This differs from continuous rubber tracks, which are typically smooth and flexible, while LEGO treads feature modular and interconnected pieces.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank is indeed situated on a smooth, flat wooden surface, with no visible gravel or irregular edges. This contrasts with natural or uneven terrain and aligns with the controlled, uniform surface common in tabletop displays or setups.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a back panel constructed of green LEGO bricks is present, mimicking a foliage backdrop and effectively replacing a natural tree background. This panel adds to the overall LEGO-themed setup, providing a consistent LEGO context for the tank model in the image.",
