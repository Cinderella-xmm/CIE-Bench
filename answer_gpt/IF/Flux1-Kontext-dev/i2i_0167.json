      "question": "Does the edited image include the apple's current front view as originally shown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a front view of an apple in the lower two panes, depicting the red apple with its characteristic shape and stem. However, the lighting and background are different from Image A, which shows the apple on a wooden table. Given that Image A provides a more natural setting as opposed to a studio-like setting in Image B, the current front view in Image B is not exactly as it was originally shown in Image A.",

      "question": "Is there a cross-section view of the apple that shows its inner flesh texture and seeds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the four sections displays a cross-section of the apple with visible inner textures and seeds. The visual details show the apple's inner core and flesh, which is typical when an apple is cut in half. This satisfies the requirement of showing the cross-section.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image contain a top view that clearly displays the apple's stem structure and calyx area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no clear top-down views focusing explicitly on the apple's stem structure and calyx area. All the views either show the front face or a cross-section of the apple. The apple's stem is visible, but the calyx area is not specifically highlighted in a top view orientation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the current front view of the apple remained unchanged compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the apple presents a similar positioning and orientation as in Image A, but the lighting and background differ. The original image shows an apple on a wooden table with natural lighting, while the updated image has a more neutral or studio-like background and lighting. Thus, despite the apple being visually similar in terms of shape, contextually it has changed.",

      "question": "Does the cross-section of the apple reveal both the flesh texture and seeds accurately?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cross-section view in Image B provides a clear depiction of the apple's inner structure, showcasing the flesh texture and the seeds. This view is typically what one would expect to see when an apple is sliced, indicating an accurate representation of its interior.",
