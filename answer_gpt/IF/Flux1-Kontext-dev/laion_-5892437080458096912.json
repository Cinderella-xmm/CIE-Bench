    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the Tudor-style gown been replaced with a draped Ancient Greek-style garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garment appears as a draped style, characteristic of ancient Greek attire, distinct from the structured and elaborate Tudor gown depicted in Image A. This analysis is drawn from the visual cues of flowing fabric and simplistic design compared to the highly detailed Tudor style previously seen.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the garment made of golden satin with a visible lustrous sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garment in Image B exhibits a golden color with a sheen indicative of satin. This observation stems from the shiny and smooth appearance of the fabric, suggestive of its satin material, contrasting with the heavier brocade of the Tudor gown.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there intricate geometric patterns (such as meanders or Greek keys) embroidered on the garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garment in Image B showcases geometric patterns, notably resembling Greek keys along the belt and sleeves. This conclusion is based on the visual identification of repeated geometric designs that align with common Greek decorative motifs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the ruffled lace collar been replaced with an ornate, braided gold necklace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the ruffled lace collar and instead features a gold band around the neckline that seems ornate. This inference arises from the noticeable absence of lace and the presence of a visually striking gold design around the neck area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shoulders bare, indicating that the sleeves have been altered to expose them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garment in Image B reveals bare shoulders, contrasting with the fully-covered arms in the Tudor gown of Image A. This alteration is apparent from the visual cue showing exposed skin around the shoulders.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are classical Greek motifs (such as laurel leaves, rosettes, or mythological figures) present on the exposed shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No decorative classical motifs or figures are present on the exposed shoulders in Image B. The observation relies on the absence of identifiable designs associated with Greek mythology or standard motifs within the shoulder area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the background been changed to depict an ancient Grecian landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features elements typical of a Grecian landscape, such as marble columns and a pastoral setting. This change is deduced from recognizing structural elements of ancient architecture and landscape style, distinctly different from the intricate patterns in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Are olive trees visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B do not appear specifically as olive trees. While there is a depiction of trees, their type remains generic without visible characteristics unique to olive species.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are marble columns visible in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly presents marble columns in the background, supporting the notion of a Greek-inspired environment. The analysis comes from recognizing the classic column design associated with Greek architecture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combination of marble columns and pastoral scenery harmonizes with the Greek-style garment and motifs in Image B. This coherence derives from the consistency in theme and design elements reflecting ancient Greek aesthetics.",
