      "question": "Are the sausages, salad, and egg completely replaced by glass tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages, salad, and egg remain as actual food items, not replaced by glass tiles. The visual texture and appearance indicate they are edible elements rather than artistic tile compositions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiles used for the sausage shapes in warm terracotta tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sausages in Image B retain their food-like appearance and are not composed of tiles. Therefore, there are no terracotta tones or tile compositions evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiles forming the salad in leafy green colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The salad in Image B appears as real leafy greens rather than being depicted through tiles. The colors are natural for lettuce leaves but do not reflect tile patterns or colors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The egg in Image B is a realistic cooked egg with no tiles used for its representation. The yolk's color is a natural egg yolk color, not a tile color.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tiles used for the sausages visibly larger than those used for the lettuce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no tiles used for either the sausages or the lettuce in Image B. They are intact food items, not tile patterns, making the comparison of tile size irrelevant.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the food items arranged on a plate with a patterned design. The plate itself has a mosaic-like appearance, but the composition of the food items does not reflect a symmetrical arrangement nor is the background plain ceramic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a cohesive mosaic design using glass tiles. Only the plate has a mosaic pattern, but the food elements are presented as realistic items, maintaining their natural appearance.",
