      "question": "Does the character display exaggerated chibi proportions with a larger head and smaller body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is stylized in the classic chibi form, where the head is disproportionately larger compared to the rest of the body, which appears smaller and more simplified. This styling is typical for chibi characters, giving them a cute and exaggerated look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the chibi version retain the character's straw hat, red jacket, and cheerful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite any modifications, the chibi version of the character maintains key identifiable features such as the straw hat and red jacket. However, the expression cannot be assessed because it is intentionally blurred.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi design retains simplified versions of the character's jacket buttons and yellow sash. Although these features are depicted with fewer details, they are still recognizable due to their color and placement, consistent with the character's identifiable wardrobe features.",
      "weight": 1,
