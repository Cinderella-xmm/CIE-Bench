        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B has exaggerated features such as a large head compared to the body, which are common characteristics of chibi style. Chibi characters are often depicted in a cute and small manner, and the keychain figure matches this description.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing an outfit with a tie and a sweater with colored stripes around the neck area. However, these do not resemble a scarf as a scarf typically wraps around the neck, whereas these features are part of the uniform design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small stick-like object with a rounded top is held by the chibi character. This resembles a wand typically seen in fantasy character designs, especially those wearing school robes and ties, similar to what is depicted here.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is clearly placed in front of and surrounded by fingers, suggesting it is being held in a human hand. The hand provides a scale reference that supports this observation.",
