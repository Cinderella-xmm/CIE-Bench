      "question": "Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes maintain their distinct black-and-white pattern, contrasting against the grass, which is depicted in a solid yellow-green color. There is a clear delineation between the zebra's stripes and the grass, without them extending or integrating seamlessly. The visual cues from Image B, combined with common sense about how colors and patterns typically interact, support the conclusion that the stripes do not blend into the grass.",

      "question": "Is the grassland rendered in a black-and-white striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the grass in a single yellow-green color with intricate line work that resembles stippling or etching. The zebra itself is rendered with black-and-white stripes, whereas the grassland does not feature any striped pattern. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues indicating uniform grass color and the distinct separation of the zebra's stripes from the grass area.",

      "question": "Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the zebra in a stylized form, where its stripes are bold and somewhat exaggerated, contrasting sharply with the uniformly colored, textured grass. The background and zebra appear to be artistically crafted rather than realistic, suggesting a surrealistic style that emphasizes drawing techniques such as line work. The imaginative rendition may imply some stylistic surrealism, but there is no direct blending or integration between the zebra and its environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes have clear and defined edges that directly juxtapose against the textured grass background. There are distinct lines showing where the zebra ends and the grass begins, without optical blending or gradual transitions between the two elements. This sharp separation suggests abrupt transitions where each pattern and element is distinctly separated from the other.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the zebra's original body proportion been maintained despite the extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in Image B retains its realistic body proportions similar to a real-life zebra, as can be inferred from comparing it to Image A, which depicts a typical zebra form. The stripes are creatively rendered but do not alter the general physical structure or proportions of the zebra itself. Common sense about animal anatomy combined with visual analysis confirms that the body proportions remain unchanged.",
