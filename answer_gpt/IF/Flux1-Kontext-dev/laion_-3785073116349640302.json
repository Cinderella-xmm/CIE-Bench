      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene featuring Ultraman and the creature is indeed enclosed within a transparent spherical globe. This is evident from the visual representation of a clear, rounded outline enclosing the comic cover art, resembling a snow globe or glass dome.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are Ultraman and the creature depicted as small, cartoonish chibi figures with large heads and simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters remain in their original comic style, with detailed and anatomically correct proportions typical of this genre. There are no indications of chibi characteristics like oversized heads or extremely simplified features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering that Image B does not depict the figures as chibi, this question is not directly applicable. Ultraman and the creature do not appear to have a shiny, reflective surface. The image retains its comic book art style, which uses standard coloration and shading techniques, not glossiness.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a visual effect of small, sparkling particles in the area surrounding the globe, suggesting an enhanced or magical environment. However, these particles are not seen swirling inside the globe around Ultraman and the creature.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the globe does not contain any rugged terrain or metallic debris. Instead, it is depicted as a plain, simple white stand without additional intricate details.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the background of Image B includes star-like patterns, they do not appear as etchings on the globe's outer surface. These patterns are part of the surrounding background design rather than the globe's surface.",
