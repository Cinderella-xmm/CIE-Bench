      "question": "Are the lily flowers now composed of transparent, amber-tinted crystal-like material with visible jagged facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers appear to have a glossy, translucent look, suggesting they are made of a crystal-like material. The amber tint and reflections give them a gem-like appearance, while careful observation reveals a jagged, faceted texture typical of cut crystals. This transformation aligns with the description of a crystal-like material.",

      "question": "Do the petals retain their original lily shape but appear constructed from layered, sharp-edged crystal facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The petals in Image B maintain the characteristic shape of lily petals in terms of contours and curves, indicative of maintaining a lily's form. However, the surface texture emulates sharp-edged, crystal-like facets, suggesting a transformation into layered, angular formations reminiscent of crystal craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Have the green stems and leaves been completely replaced with delicate, transparent glass rods extending from the vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stems within the vase appear glossy and have the appearance of glass rods due to their translucency and the way they reflect light. Their appearance contrasts with the organic, opaque look of true plant stems in Image A, indicating a replacement with glass-like structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface under the bouquet in Image B is dark and possesses a distinct pattern of lighter, meandering lines typical of marble veining. This visual cue, combined with the reflective, smooth texture, signifies the presence of a luxurious black marble tabletop.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B, including the crystal-like flowers, glass rods, and black marble surface, integrate seamlessly to convey an aesthetic of refinement and artistic design. The use of materials commonly associated with high-end sculptures and fine art enhances the elegance and crafted appearance of the composition, aligning it with fine art objects.",
