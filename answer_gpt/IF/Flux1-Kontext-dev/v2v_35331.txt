    "Question": "Q1: Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and banana are placed side by side but do not visually merge into a single unified form. The banana is distinctly placed beside the dog, each maintaining its own separate identity and form. From a visual standpoint, no attempts have been made to blend the two objects into a cohesive, singular entity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while both objects (the dog and the banana) appear natural with respect to their own forms, there are no indications that the two have been blended together into a single object. Thus, the notion of a blended form is inapplicable, and any manipulation that may have been present in other edited aspects does not affect the realism of the separate entities.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no attempts have been made to create a blended transition between the dog and the banana. They are placed separately without any overlapping or merging that would require a seamless transition. Therefore, the question of a smooth transition is inapplicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and banana are each portrayed at a realistic scale respectively, with the dog relatively small and the banana proportionate to it. However, as they are not depicted as a single, blended form, the question of the proportions and scale of a unified entity is not relevant.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows seem consistent with the outdoor setting as seen on both the dog and the banana. Each object reflects outdoor light and casts shadows consistent with the grass beneath them. However, since there is no blended form, this consistency applies only to them as separate objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
