    "Question": "Q1: Has the butterfly been transformed into a creature that visually resembles a floral being, with no recognizable insectoid body parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly retains its recognizable insectoid body parts, such as the segmented torso and antennae. While there are elements like large green leaves added to the wings which can give an appearance of floral adornment, the core insect structure is still identifiable. Therefore, it has not been completely transformed into a floral being.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the wings appear folded into distinct, vibrant petal-like structures instead of flat, membranous insect wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the butterfly maintain their typical insect wing structure. While distinct leaf-like elements have been incorporated along the wings, they don't appear as folded petal-like structures but rather decorative additions. The wings essentially retain their insectoid character.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the butterfly's body now resemble a thin, upright flower stalk rather than an insect’s segmented torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the butterfly still resembles an insect’s segmented torso typical to a butterfly, with distinct markings and structure. It doesn't emulate the appearance of a flower stalk, maintaining its original form.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the original wing patterns replaced with detailed, naturalistic leaf designs across the entire surface of the wings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings still retain the original Monarch butterfly wing patterns with orange and black hues. The additional elements like leaves are an extension and do not replace the wing surface patterns.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible tendril-like structures extending from the tips of the butterfly's antennae?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly’s antennae have been altered to include tendril-like extensions with spirals and additional smaller blossoms attached to them. This is a clear addition in contrast to standard, unadorned antennae in butterflies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there small blossoms visibly attached to the edges of the wings and at the foot/lowest part of the creature?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows small blossoms attached to the lower edges of the wings and alongside the tendrils from the antennae. These embellishments resemble floral elements added to the insect's wings and lower part.",
    "answer": "Yes"
