    "Question": "Q1: Has the surfboard been replaced with a giant manta ray?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object beneath the surfer is analyzed. Based on visual cues, a large aquatic creature is seen beneath the surfer, resembling a shark rather than a manta ray. The distinctive features such as the shape and presence of a dorsal fin help identify the creature as a shark, not a manta ray. Thus, the surfboard has not been replaced by a manta ray.",
