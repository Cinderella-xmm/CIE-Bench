    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly shown inside a transparent glass dome. This is evident from the visible glass structure that surrounds the teapot, allowing a clear view of it while enclosing it completely. The presence of the dome is a deliberate addition for presumably decorative or protective purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot placed on an elevated platform which has a metallic appearance with intricate engravings. However, the platform itself does not exhibit reflective properties typical of a mirror where clear reflections of surrounding objects or the teapot might be visible. Hence, it cannot be described as a reflective mirrored base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small white porcelain cups are seen arranged in a circular fashion around the base of the teapot, on the platform within the glass dome. This arrangement is visible in the image, indicating their circular and surrounding placement relative to the teapot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a teapot with elaborate engravings, but these appear consistent with the overall design and do not suggest additional engravings beyond those seen in Image A. The patterns are ornate but not evidently more detailed in Image B compared to the original impression in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible faux steam spirals rising upward from the teapot, forming curved, wispy trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly shows wispy, curved trails resembling steam spiraling upwards from the teapot. These trails are visually evident and designed to mimic the natural flow of steam, likely added as a visual effect to suggest the teapot's functionality or warmth.",
