      "question": "Has the original pyramid been converted into five adorable chibi-style Russian nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are five nesting dolls placed in front of the pyramid. These dolls have a rounded, humanoid shape and appear similar to traditional Russian nesting dolls, each with designs resembling pyramids on them. The original pyramid is intact in the background; therefore, the pyramid has not been converted into dolls, but rather the dolls are added to the scene.",
