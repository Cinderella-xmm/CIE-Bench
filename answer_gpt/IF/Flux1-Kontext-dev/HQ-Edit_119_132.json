      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky's surface is smooth and uniform, resembling fabric rather than the complex fur texture of a live animal. Its posture is rigid and symmetrical, typical of a plush toy, rather than the more dynamic stance of a live animal. Its eyes and facial expressions are simplified and stylized, suggesting a non-living object, confirming it is a plush toy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paws of the husky are noticeably larger in proportion to its body compared to what is observed in realistic images of huskies. This exaggerated feature is often used in plush toys to enhance their cuteness and appeal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the husky in Image B is smooth and lacks the individual strands of hair seen in fur. Instead, it gives the appearance of a continuous, velvety fabric, which is common in plush toys, indicating the texture change.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the husky in Image B are very stylized, with minimal detail, and appear to be part of the fabric structure, similar to embroidered features. This contrasts with the realistic textures and reflections found in a live animal's eyes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface beneath the husky in Image B is flat, uniform, and shows wood grain patterns typical of a wooden shelf. This suggests that the plush toy is indeed placed on a wooden shelf.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is plain and uniform in color, lacking any intricate or natural elements such as snow, trees, or sky. This minimalist background is common in studio settings or for showcasing products like plush toys.",
