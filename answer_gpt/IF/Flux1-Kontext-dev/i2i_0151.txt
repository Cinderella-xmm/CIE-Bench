    "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is the focal point on the postcard, set against a mostly clear blue sky with only a few clouds that do not distract from the kite itself. The postcard layout frames the kite without overwhelming it with other objects, ensuring it remains the center of attention.

    "Question": "Q5: Are the structural details of the kite, such as its frame and tail, well-defined and clear enough to suggest it could be crafted from paper?",
    "explanation": "The kite in Image B has distinct, defined lines where the frame and panels meet, a characteristic trait of paper models. This, along with the flatness and clear visibility of the tail and edge details, provides the impression that the kite could be effectively replicated as a paper craft. Additionally, the textured and slightly rigid appearance adds to the notion that its construction could be from paper, enabling optimal clarity and definition for crafting.",
