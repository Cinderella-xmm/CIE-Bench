    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit a 3D style with depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays depth perception through the sharpness and clarity of the kitten against a slightly blurred background. This is a common technique in 3D style images to create a sense of depth and realism without needing special devices.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the kitten as actively jumping out of the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the kitten appears to be engaging with the viewer, having its front paw extended as if reaching or jumping towards the observer. The expression on its face also suggests movement, contributing to the illusion that it is jumping out of the screen.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 3D effect in the image achieved without requiring special glasses or external devices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D effect in the edited image is achieved through visual techniques like sharpness, color contrast, and positioning of the kitten to imply depth without the need for special glasses or devices. This is typical in digital graphics and photography where simple compositional elements suggest 3D realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the kitten's original appearance, including color and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the color and texture of the kitten appear unchanged in the edited image. The vibrant orange fur and smooth textures are consistent, suggesting that the original appearance is maintained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's features still clearly visible and not obscured by the 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the 3D effect creating a depth perception, the kitten's features like its eyes, fur patterns, and facial expression remain clear and unobscured, indicating that the visual effects do not detract from the clarity of the kitten's appearance.",
