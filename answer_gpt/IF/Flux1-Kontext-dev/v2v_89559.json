      "question": "Have the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos been transformed into stylized, gleaming golden award statuettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos are visualized as tangible, solid objects resembling award statuettes, which are evident from their 3D shape, metallic golden color and reflection, imitating the look of trophies or awards. In contrast, Image A presents these logos as flat graphic designs. This transformation implies a physical portrayal of logos as awards.",

      "question": "Has the background been changed to a rich, dark velvet curtain, replacing the original green background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a deep, rich, dark color with visible folds, indicative of a velvet curtain, which often provides an elegant backdrop. In comparison, Image A has a simple green background with no such texture. This change in background material and color is obvious and significant.",

      "question": "Is the 'Sumo Digital' logo rendered as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Sumo Digital' logo is depicted on the base of an award in a way that suggests embossing on wood, with a circular seal-like appearance and a wooden texture surrounding it. This differs from Image A, where the logo is part of the flat graphic. The three-dimensional and embossed appearance is more consistent with an engraved seal on a physical object.",

      "question": "Is the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text presented in elegant, engraved silver lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text appears in a similar style to Image A; it's white and possibly meant to be engraved due to the context of awards, but there is no indication of a silver coloration or engraved appearance. Thus, while it maintains its presence, it does not specifically appear as engraved in silver.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the structural integrity of the original image been maintained while applying the specified changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The major elements such as logos and text remain present in both images, albeit portrayed differently in style and form. The edited image has recontextualized the logos and background, creating a more dynamic scene with three-dimensional awards while keeping original themes intact. Thus, the fundamental structure, in terms of content, is preserved while being artistically altered.",
