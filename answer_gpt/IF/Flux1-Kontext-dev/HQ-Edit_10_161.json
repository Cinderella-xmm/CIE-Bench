        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features a distinct mosaic pattern, showcasing geometric shapes that are reminiscent of African tribal art.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklaces and bracelets exhibit a prominent change in texture and appearance.

      "question": "Has the background been transformed into a stylized tapestry of warm earth tones, depicting varied African terrains through texture and color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a significant transformation in the background, where the colors have shifted to warm earth tones, and the texture resembles a tapestry. The blending of colors and textures creates an abstract representation of African terrains, depicting a more artistic rendition through texture and color schemes. This effect gives the background a more intricate and artistic look, suggestive of tapestry weaving.",

      "question": "Has the hairstyle been transformed into a bas-relief sculpture style, with visible depth, shadow, and sculpted texture, while preserving its original color and structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle maintains its original color and structure but now appears to have been transformed into a bas-relief style. This is evidenced by the visible depth and shadow effects, as well as a sculpted texture that gives the hair a more dimensional and tactile appearance, akin to a relief sculpture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the transformations, Image B maintains cultural authenticity and coherence. The attire and jewelry reflect traditional African design motifs through the mosaic and stained glass styles, respectively. The stylized background corresponds with motifs commonly found in African art, and the hairstyle transformation retains its cultural roots while adding artistic flair. The alterations across attire, jewelry, background, and hairstyle complement each other, preserving a visually harmonious and culturally authentic composite.",
