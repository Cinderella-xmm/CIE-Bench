      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B depicts a skier in a dynamic pose, similar to that of the skier in Image A. Both the original skier and the figurine are depicted with their knees bent, arms forward, and ski poles pointed diagonally downward, capturing a fluid skiing motion. This similarity implies that the figurine maintains the essential posture and energy of the skier from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the figurine with the skis integrated seamlessly with the model, suggesting they are part of a single assembly.

      "question": "Is there a magnetic snow powder base attached to the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is displayed on what appears to be a snow-like base, which mimics the snowy slope the skier navigates. The base is visually distinct, giving an impression of depth and snow powder. Additionally, there are circular objects visible in the packaging, which could suggest magnetic capabilities, correlating with the concept of a magnetic base to hold the skier's position.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
