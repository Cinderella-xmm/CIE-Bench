      "question": "Is the horse visibly composed of distinct 3D puzzle pieces with defined edges separating each section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe the horse is painted with floral patterns and does not have visible defining lines or separations that suggest it is made from puzzle pieces. The surface looks smooth and continuous, which is typically not characteristic of a 3D puzzle. Additionally, the floral pattern seems completed within continuous segments without being segmented by puzzle piece edges. This implies that the horse is likely not composed of distinct 3D puzzle pieces.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the horse enclosed within a wooden-framed display case that has a transparent glass dome covering it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is indeed placed inside a display case that appears to have a transparent covering. The glass dome characteristic is evident due to the round edges, and the structure's transparency allows us to see the horse within the case. The presence of the wooden base at the bottom of this covering supports the interpretation that it is part of a display case setup.",

    {

      "question": "Does the display case rest on a textured wooden base that shows natural wood grain or carving details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the display case beneath the glass covering has a wooden appearance displaying a realistic wood grain texture. This visual detail suggests that the wood grain is naturally occurring in the wood or represents crafted detailing of carving. Observing these realistic textures allows us to conclude that the base is indeed showcasing natural wood grain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the intricate floral patterns on the horse fragmented across individual puzzle sections, with no single piece showing a complete motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the horse do not appear fragmented across separate puzzle sections. The design is complete and continuous across large areas of the horse — each floral motif is depicted without interruption, maintaining aesthetic continuity across the horse's surface. This points to the horse being a single unified surface rather than a composition of separate puzzle pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a vintage-style compass embedded or placed on the wooden base of the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the front of the wooden base, there is a circular instrument with a dial and hands, reminiscent of a vintage style. While it's not specifically labeled as a compass, its placement and appearance correspond with characteristics typical of a vintage-style compass which commonly features such a design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible antique-brass colored accents such as hinges, trim, or fixtures on the display case or base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible accents on the wooden base. Specifically, the base has brass-like elements — one being a circular component at each corner which resembles decorative fixtures. The color and appearance are similar to antique-brass finishes, commonly used in design to enhance the aesthetics with metal details. These decorative elements align with antique-brass styles.",
