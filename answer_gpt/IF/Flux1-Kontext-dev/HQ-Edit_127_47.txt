    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire forest lake scene enclosed within a visible spherical glass orb?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the forest lake scene is clearly contained within a visible spherical glass orb, as indicated by the curvature of the surface and the reflections that suggest a glass material. The edges of the orb are distinct, enclosing the scene entirely. This presents a miniature world within the orb, depicting the natural landscape in a contained manner. Commonly, glass orbs are used in snow globes or similar decorations to hold scenes encapsulated within.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks retain their realistic appearance similar to those typically seen in natural settings rather than appearing as 3D models with glossy, reflective finishes. This suggests they have not been replaced and remain part of the naturalistic theme within the scene depicted in the glass orb. The visual cues, such as the texture and color of the ducks, reflect a natural setting rather than a manufactured look.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water within the glass orb visually appears clear and detailed, with reflections and shading that suggest depth, similar to resin-like textures. This simulates a natural depth and transparency, which is often a characteristic in artistic renderings of water. Such textures enhance the realistic perception of the water, contributing to the clarity and detail observed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are there visible miniature figurines of woodland animals placed among the rocks and vegetation?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains a miniature scene within the glass orb with a focus on ducks but does not show any visible miniature figurines of woodland animals among the rocks and vegetation. The setting within the orb is centered on the natural landscape and water, primarily featuring the ducks as the focal point without additional figurine animals.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the glass orb resting on a natural wood base with visible organic textures such as grain or bark?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass orb is indeed resting on a wooden base. The base exhibits typical characteristics of wood, such as visible grain and organic textures, enhancing the natural appearance of the display. This choice of material complements the scene within the orb by providing a naturalistic and rustic foundation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
