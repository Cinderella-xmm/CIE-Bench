    "Question": "Q1: Has the painting on the wall been removed?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we see that there is a large frame on the wall which appears to contain an artwork depicting a scenic view with palm trees, a lake, and a bright sky. The presence of this frame and painting confirms that a painting is present on the wall. It's important to consider that textures and elements signify an artistic representation rather than a digital screen or real-time image. Hence, there is a painting still on the wall.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Has a digital display screen been added in place of the painting?",

There is no indication of pixels or technology elements common in digital screens. The image is artistic rather than technological, hence it remains a painting, not a digital display.",
