      "question": "Does the edited image feature oversized eyes and soft facial features for the scientist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, each depiction of the scientist follows the typical chibi art style characterized by oversized eyes and soft, exaggerated facial features. This style is common in anime and cartoon representations, intended to evoke cuteness and expressiveness. Based on these visual cues and the distinct chibi style known for such features, the answer is derived.",

      "question": "Is the scientist dressed in a white lab coat over a light blue shirt in all six poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, all six character drawings consistently depict the scientist wearing a white lab coat over a light blue shirt. This outfit suggests a typical representation of a scientist or medical professional, reinforcing consistency in attire across all poses. The visual consistency confirms the choice.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background bright green with hexagonal patterns or chemical formula motifs, leaving some blank white space around each sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses a bright green background featuring hexagonal patterns suggestive of chemical or scientific motifs. These hexagonal patterns represent molecular structures or chemistry themes, commonly used in science-related designs. There is visible blank white space surrounding each sticker, enhancing their separation from the background and making them stand out. These observations lead to the identified choice.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In one of the poses, is the scientist holding a beaker filled with a bubbling, vibrant liquid and wearing a curious expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, one pose clearly shows the scientist character holding a beaker with a vibrant liquid inside, which appears bubbling and colorful, consistent with typical cartoon or chibi renditions of chemistry experiments. The scientist is depicted with an expressive pose, suggestive of curiosity or interest in the contents of the beaker. These visual elements and the typical narrative associated with scientists handling beakers support the answer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all six stickers designed with an aspect ratio of 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, all stickers appear to maintain a similar aspect ratio, which is evident from their consistent design and layout. However, the individual stickers do not fit the 9:16 aspect ratio typically used for entire frames or screens rather than stickers. These chibi characters are usually drawn in varying positions, resulting in different shapes that do not conform to such a uniform aspect ratio, refuting the provided choice.",
