      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open and the pages are visible, but they do not extend out of the image frame. The entirety of the book and its pages are contained within the frame of the image. This conclusion is drawn by observing the edges of the book in the image.",

      "question": "Is there a subtle curved shadow on the extended pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the pages do not extend out of the frame, hence there are no extended pages to display any shadow. Based on the visual cues, shadows are typically formed due to light obstruction, but in this case, the pages are neatly bounded within the image frame, and no additional area of pages or shadow is visible.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the editing convey the impression that the book is unfolding toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is open with its pages laid out flat on a wooden surface, and there is no visible alteration to suggest movement or unfolding towards the viewer. The angle of the book and its pages seem consistent with a stationary position without any dynamic unfolding action. This conclusion relies on the stability of the book's position relative to the viewer.",

    {

      "question": "Are the extended pages visually consistent with the original book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not show any pages extending out of the frame, there is no visual inconsistency among book pages to analyze. Thus all visible pages are part of the original book's layout and appear to be consistent in terms of paper texture and text alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a seamless transition between the original and extended parts of the book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes  \n```",
      "explanation": "Without any extension of pages out of the frame in Image B, there is no transition to analyze between original and extended pages. All visible pages are part of the book's original setup, implying that if there had been an editing feature to extend pages, consistent visual elements would be necessary for a seamless transition.",
