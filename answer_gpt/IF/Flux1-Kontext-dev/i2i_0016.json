      "question": "Have the two players been converted into cartoon-style chibi characters, while still maintaining their original clothing and hairstyles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style clearly shows two individuals depicted as cartoon-style chibi characters, which are characterized by exaggerated features such as large heads and compact bodies. Despite this style change, the characters maintain elements consistent with their appearances from the original image, such as similar clothing with white tops and dark bottoms, aligning with the athletic wear depicted in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi characters holding tennis rackets and shown in a handshake pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both chibi characters are visibly holding tennis rackets and are depicted in a handshake pose, which is a common gesture of sportsmanship in tennis matches. This is consistent with the original image (Image A) where the two players engage in a similar pose, thus reflecting this aspect in the cartoon adaptation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a semi-transparent tennis court logo included in the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a semi-transparent circular logo with a tennis court motif in the background. This is discernible despite being abstracted and stylized, serving as an indication of the setting being related to tennis. This design element is unique to Image B, as Image A showcases an actual tennis court instead.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the image been formatted as a sticker-ready graphic suitable for printing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a design that includes a bold white outline around the chibi characters and logo, often used for sticker designs to ensure clarity and separation from backgrounds when printed. The simplified and vibrant cartoon style further enhances this comparison, indicating readiness for printing as a sticker graphic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the final image maintain the original scene's context as a tennis match, despite the chibi art style adaptation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi art style in Image B successfully maintains the original context of a tennis match, characterized by visual elements such as tennis rackets, the medium of a handshake, and the inclusion of a background tennis court logo. Image A originally depicts such a scenario in a realistic style, which is adapted into a creative cartoon format while retaining the essential thematic elements.",
