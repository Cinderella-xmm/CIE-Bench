      "question": "Does the edited image show thick impasto and swirling patterns typical of Van Gogh's style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features swirling patterns and textured strokes, which are reminiscent of Van Gogh's signature style. The swirling brushstrokes create movement and texture that are commonly seen in Van Gogh's paintings. This edited version appears to simulate the thick impasto technique by visually representing textured paint with swirling lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the colors in the edited image been adapted to reflect Van Gogh's vibrant yet slightly muted palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette includes vibrant blues, oranges, and yellows, which are characteristic of Van Gogh's use of color. While vibrant, the tones are not oversaturated, aligning with Van Gogh's style where colors are lively yet bear a subtlety that conveys mood rather than stark brightness.",

      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit the textured surface typical of Van Gogh's oil paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses swirling brushstrokes, suggesting a textured surface similar to Van Gogh's oil paintings. This simulated texture gives the appearance of layers of paint, mimicking the tactile quality associated with Van Gogh's technique, known for its visible brushwork and dimensionality.",

      "question": "Has the original composition of the blue mug been maintained in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the composition involves the blue mug on a coaster seen from a certain perspective. Image B retains the same layout and the position of the mug and coaster without altering their spatial arrangement. Despite stylistic changes in texture and color, the composition remains unchanged.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B suggests depth and layering through its use of swirling, textured strokes that create a visual sense of dimension. This simulates the layering technique used by Van Gogh, where multiple layers of color and texture contribute to the painting's depth perception.",
