      "question": "Are the cheetah figures replaced with gold-finished perfume bottles that maintain their original seated poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects resemble perfume bottles shaped like seated cheetahs, finished in a gold color. The original pose of the cheetahs from Image A is maintained as they are similarly seated in a symmetrical fashion on both sides of the central element. The smooth, metallic finish gives them a distinct appearance, distinguishing them from the more realistic texture and pattern seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the botanical center been replaced with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade that has a cascading downward appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is indeed replaced by a translucent glass with a green tint, giving it a sleek, modern look. It looks smooth and vertical, mimicking a glass façade often found in modern architectural designs. This differs from Image A, which features a pattern resembling botanical leaves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" present on the bases of both objects in a chic serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the text 'Savanna Essence' on the base of both gold-finished objects. The font used is a serif type, which often conveys elegance and style, suitable for luxury product branding. This text was not present in Image A, which had no such branding or font.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image convey an elegant and luxurious aesthetic consistent with a high-end retail perfume display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys elegance and luxury through the use of gold-finished objects, the chic serif font of the branding, and the sleek, translucent central glass element. These elements collectively suggest a high-end retail display, often associated with luxury perfume products, which contrasts with the more traditional and less luxurious elements in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the two gold-finished perfume bottles symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade, preserving the original spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning remains symmetrical with each gold-finished bottle placed on either side of the central glass façade, maintaining the spatial arrangement seen in Image A where each cheetah was positioned symmetrically around the center. This symmetry is a common design principle in luxury displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a reflective surface beneath the objects showing clear reflections of the perfume bottles and central façade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a reflective surface beneath the objects, as there is no visible reflection of the gold-finished bottles and the central glass façade. Image A has a kind of reflective base, but the clarity of reflections in Image B is not evident.",
