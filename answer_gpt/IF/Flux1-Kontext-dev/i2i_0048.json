      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors and details of the zebras and the surrounding grassland appear more prominent and distinct compared to a typical unedited photo. This indicates that the contrast has likely been enhanced to make the stripes on the zebras and the hues of the grass stand out against the rest of the image. No direct comparison is needed, as this conclusion is based on common knowledge of photo editing techniques such as contrast enhancement, which increases the difference between light and dark areas.",

      "question": "Is there visible improvement in the sharpness of zebras and the grassy ground in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines and details of the zebras, as well as the texture of the grass, appear crisper and more defined. This suggests an enhancement in sharpness, which is a common technique used to bring out details in an image, making edges and textures more noticeable.",

      "question": "Are the natural textures of the zebras' stripes and the grassland detailed and clear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a clear and detailed texture of both the zebras' stripes and the grassland, which is evident through the visible and distinct patterns on the zebras and the individual blades of grass being more pronounced. This clarity usually results from enhancements such as contrast and sharpness adjustments.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no signs of urban elements such as buildings, vehicles, or people that are typically associated with a city life photojournalism aesthetic. The image maintains a natural setting with only zebras and grassland visible, indicative of a natural wildlife scene.",

      "question": "Has the original composition of the zebras in the grassland been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the composition of the zebras standing in an open grassland. There are no visible changes to their arrangement or the inclusion of additional elements that would alter the original scene's composition. Thus, the central focus of the zebras in their natural habitat is preserved.",
