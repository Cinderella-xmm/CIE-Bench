      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the king piece now depicted as a regally robed water deity with visible fluid or wave-like motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the king piece is not transformed into a water deity with fluid or wave-like motifs. The king appears to be unchanged from its original form shown in Image A, where it is a standard chess king piece. Therefore, no visual cues suggest it has been depicted as a water deity.",

      "question": "Is the queen piece now depicted as a regally robed fire deity with visible flame or ember-like motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piece next to the king is transformed to resemble a figure robed with a fiery outline and flame-like effects, suggesting it is depicted as a fire deity. This represents a significant transformation from Image A, where it was a regular queen piece.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any of the pieces as being transformed into stone golems with carved armor or rocky textures. The focus is on the transformed figures resembling deities with elemental motifs rather than golems.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bishop pieces are not depicted as ethereal or translucent wind phantoms. There are no swirling or flowing visual effects indicating a transformation into wind phantoms. The bishop appears as a regular piece adjacent to the transformed figures, resembling a deity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pawn pieces are adjacent to the transformed deity-like figures and exhibit a luminous glow, suggesting a transformation into sprites with shimmering or reflective qualities. This is a change from Image A, where they appear as standard pawns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed pieces such as the deity-like figures and glowing pawns remain in their original positions when compared to Image A. Thus, their locations on the chessboard did not change after the transformation.",
