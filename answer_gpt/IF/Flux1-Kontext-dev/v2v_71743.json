      "question": "Does the paint splatter texture now depict iconic New York cityscapes or abstract urban art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the area previously featuring paint splatter texture now shows a clear view of skyscrapers typical of a New York City skyline. This shift represents iconic cityscapes rather than abstract art. Image A incorporated abstract art with multicolored splatters, contributing to a more experimental or contemporary urban aesthetic. The transformation in Image B is evident through recognizable architectural features, making its depiction one of actual cityscapes rather than abstract themes.",

      "question": "Has the white electric guitar been redesigned to represent a musical style or era resonant with New York City?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the electric guitar remains unchanged in its design compared to Image A. It continues to have an abstract colorful pattern overlay, but there are no specific stylistic changes to suggest a distinct musical style or era tied to New York City. This indicates the absence of any new design elements that would connect with the musical heritage or styles associated with NYC.",

      "question": "Does the overall design aesthetic reflect gritty subway art, sophisticated jazz age graphics, or bold modern typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall aesthetic presents a cleaner depiction with the NYC skyline and the electric guitar. There are no visual elements that suggest gritty subway art or sophisticated jazz age graphics. Bold modern typography is reflected in the clear and stylized text of 'NEW YORK Guitar Method', making modern typography its prominent design aspect. Image A's abstract art could be vaguely reminiscent of grittier subway art, but Image B's streamlined skyline focus leans away from this aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a clear and legible primary title, 'NEW YORK Guitar Method'. This is consistent across both images, where the typography stands out against the background, ensuring readability and clarity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Ensemble Book 2' remains prominently displayed at the bottom, just as in Image A. This consistent positioning and style affirm its identity as 'Ensemble Book 2', maintaining continuity between the two images.",
