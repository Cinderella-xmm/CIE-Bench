      "question": "Has the Sphinx’s head been replaced with a radiant sun disc featuring visible hieroglyphic patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx's head is depicted with a radiant sun disc situated atop it, which clearly showcases hieroglyphic patterns. This is a significant alteration from the ordinary Sphinx design, where the head does not feature a sun disc. The visual cues, such as the circular shape and the distinct carvings resembling hieroglyphs, lead to the conclusion that the head has been modified to include a sun disc.",

      "question": "Are there shimmering golden wings extending from both sides of the Sphinx’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx is shown with golden wings extending from both sides of its body. These wings are prominent and not part of the traditional Sphinx design as seen in Image A, where there are no wings. The wings’ color and texture in Image B suggest a shimmering golden appearance, modifying the typical design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the limbs of the Sphinx show flowing desert sands cascading downward from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that the limbs of the Sphinx do not produce an effect where desert sands appear to flow or cascade from them. Instead, the paws are distinct and rest on a bed of clouds, without any visual indication of moving sand akin to a cascade. This is consistent with typical representations of a stationary Sphinx.",

      "question": "Are there ankhs glowing in azure color located on the paws of the Sphinx?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, clearly depicts glowing ankhs in an azure hue placed on the paws of the Sphinx. This addition introduces a distinct and symbolic embellishment that is visible from the blue color and the recognizable shape of ankhs, indicating an intentional modification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx still positioned in the same location relative to the background elements (such as the pyramid and sunset), with the sun disc correctly placed where the head was?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of both images shows that the Sphinx remains in the same relative location concerning the pyramid and sunset in the background. Although modifications are evident, such as the sun disc added to the Sphinx’s head area, the spatial arrangement relative to background elements remains consistent between the two images. This indicates an adjustment to the head area but not to the positioning of the entire Sphinx.",
