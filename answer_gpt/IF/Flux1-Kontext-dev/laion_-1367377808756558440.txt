    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire naval scene enclosed within a visible vintage glass lantern structure?",
    "explanation": "The object enclosing the scene in Image B resembles a large glass jar or bottle rather than a glass lantern. The jar contains the ship, dock, and surrounding elements, making it appear as a miniature diorama inside a glass vessel. Glass lanterns typically have metal frames and are meant to hold lights, whereas this is clearly a cylindrical glass container similar to a bottle.",
