      "question": "Is the woman's head significantly larger than her body, consistent with a cartoon-style character design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's head is depicted as being disproportionately larger compared to her body, which is a characteristic feature of a cartoon or chibi-style design. This artistic choice emphasizes a playful and exaggerated aesthetic, often used to convey cuteness or humor. This style typically involves oversized heads and smaller bodies, creating a whimsical and non-realistic proportion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red boots are distinctly visible and maintain their characteristic bright red color and form.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character designed with bold black outlines encapsulating its entire form, which is a common technique used in illustrations to give a defined shape or toy-like appearance. This style can resemble figures made from soft rubber or vinyl toys, where the outlines help to emphasize contours and provide a distinct graphical look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is indeed shown in an exaggerated bending-over pose. Her torso is angled downward towards her legs, mirroring the position observed in Image A. This portrayal emphasizes a particular posture where the character is leaning forward significantly, which can often denote action or a playful stance in cartoon representations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible attachment point at the top of the character where a silver-colored metal keyring is connected. This feature transforms the character into a functional accessory, such as a keychain, allowing it to be carried or displayed conveniently.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
