    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the house appear as a sentient, mythical treehouse creature rather than a conventional dwelling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited house presents unique features that attribute to a mythical appearance. The house's support columns resemble legs or roots, contributing to a creature-like quality. The framing of a large eye-like structure at the front of the house further enhances the sense of a sentient being. These elements combined deviate from conventional architecture, suggesting the house is meant to represent a sentient, mythical treehouse creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns replaced with detailed, leg-like wooden structures resembling limbs or roots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical supports of the house are clearly transformed into structures that closely resemble tree roots or limbs, adding to the perception of the house being organic or alive. This design choice signals a deviation from standard house supports seen in conventional buildings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the straw roof been replaced by an overgrowth of realistic leafy branches forming a natural canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roofing of the house takes on the appearance of a green, leafy canopy, as opposed to a traditional thatched straw roof. This change makes the structure appear more integrated with nature, resembling a natural overgrowth akin to tree foliage.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish transformed into a large, lidless eye with visible iris and pupil features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the satellite dish remains a satellite dish, maintaining its mechanical construction without transformation into an eye. Its shape and form closely align with typical satellite dish structures without any additional features like an iris or pupil.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the exterior walls fully covered with detailed, textured patterns resembling natural tree bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exterior walls of the structure in Image B do not exhibit a texture or pattern that convincingly resembles tree bark. They maintain a wooden or conventional appearance, lacking any detailed texturing that would assimilate them with natural tree bark.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange blossoms present on the structure do not show any visible glow or aura. They maintain a natural appearance consistent with garden flowers, without emitting light or possessing a glowing effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there long, trailing vines descending from the treehouse, giving it an organic, flowing appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals long, trailing elements resembling vines or roots that stretch from the house's structure, contributing a flowing, organic appearance to the edited house. This feature enhances the perception of the building as something living or grown rather than built.",
