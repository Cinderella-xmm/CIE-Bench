    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is placed within a glass display case, presented as a 3D model. The stylization is apparent through the artificial setting and the distinct edges of the aircraft, which suggest it is a model rather than a real plane. This presentation contrasts with a photorealistic representation which would strive for a lifelike depiction of an aircraft in a natural environment.",

      "question": "Is the aircraft fully encased within a glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is visibly encased within a display case. This is evident from the wooden frame with glass panels surrounding it, clearly indicating that the aircraft is displayed in an enclosed setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible worn leather accents on the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case features wood and metal elements, notably brass-colored corner fittings, but there are no visible worn leather accents. The materials and their condition do not resemble leather.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the display case have brass-colored corner fittings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass-colored corner fittings are visible on the display case in Image B, providing stylistic and structural elements to the overall design of the case. These fittings are placed at each corner, contrasting with the wooden parts of the case.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the front face of the display case in Image B, an engraved emblem is prominently displayed on a circular medallion positioned on the wooden base. This detail is clear and distinct, contributing to the case's decorative and thematic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small, artificial clouds placed inside the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the glass display case in Image B, there are artificial clouds present. These clouds are stylized, situated around the aircraft, enhancing the display by simulating a sky environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the aircraft oriented diagonally upward within the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft maintains a horizontal orientation within the display case, mimicking level flight rather than a diagonal upward climb. The perspective does not give an impression of an upward trajectory.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the propellers of the aircraft show visual effects indicating they are spinning (e.g., motion blur or rotational distortion)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the aircraft with propellers that appear static, as there is no visual indication of motion blur or rotational effects that would suggest spinning. The blades' positions are steady and unchanged, typical of a model display.",
