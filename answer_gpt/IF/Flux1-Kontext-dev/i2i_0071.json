      "question": "Has the train been transformed into a futuristic maglev train design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train appears with a sleek, modern design featuring rounded edges and a streamlined structure that suggests a futuristic style. Maglev trains typically have a futuristic appearance with advanced engineering, but as Image B presents the train with wheels visible beneath, it does not depict the levitating capability of true maglev technology. Therefore, despite the modern appearance, it is not definitively a maglev train.",

      "question": "Does the train retain the original white and red color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is presented with a primarily white color and red striping along the side. These are common design elements in many modern trains, including some high-speed or futuristic models, and match the conventional white and red color scheme. Thus, Image B retains these color characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the train incorporate elements indicative of maglev technology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Maglev technology is characterized by the absence of wheels and the train levitating above the track. In Image B, the train shows what appears to be wheels underneath, suggesting some form of contact with the ground rather than levitation. This indicates that the train does not incorporate typical elements of maglev technology.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train still appear recognizable as a train despite the futuristic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape and design elements of Image B, such as the elongated body, windows, and frontal design, align with common features found in modern train designs, allowing it to still be recognized as a train regardless of its sleek and futuristic modifications.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have all parts of the original train been transformed into the new maglev design, with no elements of the old design remaining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B presents a modern design, the visible wheels below the train body are contrary to a pure maglev transformation, where wheels would not be present. This suggests that not all parts have been transformed and that elements of conventional train design remain.",
