      "question": "Is the entire urban street scene recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the urban street scene appears to be represented in a style reminiscent of Lego due to the smooth, blocky appearance of the surfaces, uniformity, and toy-like characteristics of the scene. However, it lacks the distinctive interlocking brick pattern that is characteristic of Lego bricks. The scene adopts a cartoonish or animated style that could hint at Lego-like qualities but does not specifically display Lego features. Therefore, it could be perceived as a stylized representation rather than an actual Lego construction.",

      "question": "Are the cobblestones on the path represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestones in Image B, while having a uniformly spaced, block-like appearance, don't show the typical studs or seams indicative of Lego bricks. They appear smooth and stylized rather than constructed from traditional Lego pieces. Therefore, they are not accurately represented as Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Are the buildings in the background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings in Image B adopt a simplified and clean style, which might remind one of a Lego aesthetic; however, they lack the clear modular and interlocking characteristics that define Lego bricks. The surfaces appear smooth without the typical textures or separations expected if constructed with Lego. Thus, while stylized, they aren't strictly recreated using Lego bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man and his clothing, bag, and cap represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted in a way that is reminiscent of a stylized or animated figure, having elements similar to a Lego mini-figure due to the simplistic and blockish details. However, the man, his clothing, and accessories do not have the defining Lego features, such as connectors or distinct shapes, that would classify them as being represented using Lego bricks. Instead, they seem more like a digital or cartoon representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and perspective of the urban street scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A and Image B both share a similar composition and perspective, showing the back of a man walking on a cobblestone path between buildings. The alignment of elements such as the man, the path, and the buildings and the perspective view down the street are consistent between the two images. Despite the stylistic transformation in Image B into a cartoon-like appearance, the original composition and perspective are preserved.",
