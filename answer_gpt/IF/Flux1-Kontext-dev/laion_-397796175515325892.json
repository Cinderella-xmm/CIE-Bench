    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the church been rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified shapes and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailing and texture of the church appear smooth and less complex compared to traditional photograph perceptions. The lines and structures suggest a stylization typically seen in semi-cartoon representations, where realism is slightly sacrificed for artistic effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the architectural elements of the church perfectly symmetrical on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, both sides of the church feature identical architectural features such as window placements, roof shapes, and ornamentations. This symmetry is also regularly observed in churches to maintain balance aesthetically and structurally.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic gold accents applied specifically to the spires and upper parts of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show metallic gold accents on the spires or upper parts of the church. The church's colors remain consistent, without signs of metallic elements that would reflect or visually contrast against its primary stone and brick colors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the proportion of the church been altered to enhance its sense of grandeur and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the church retains its original scale and proportions, consistent with those expected in a photograph of such a building. There is no alteration in size or exaggerated features that would suggest it was made larger or grander.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a celestial-themed design featuring elements like stars, galaxies, or cosmic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background with a darker blue hue resembling sky color, but lacks explicit celestial features such as stars or galaxies. This suggests a change from the original but not to a celestial theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there three separate architectural art prints displayed, each within a matte black frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows three identical images of the church, each enclosed within its own matte black frame, indicating separate pieces of art rather than a single composite piece.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the three prints arranged in a trifold album format, with a central fold and two outer panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the three prints in Image B is linear, each side by side, rather than a foldable trifold album format. Such formats would typically have hinging for folding, not shown here.",
