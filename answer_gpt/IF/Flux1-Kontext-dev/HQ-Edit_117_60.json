      "question": "Is the sailboat rendered entirely as a carved walnut wood sculpture, with no metallic, fabric, or realistic marine materials visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sailboat is clearly depicted as a sculpture made entirely of walnut wood. The details like the sail, hull, and other parts appear crafted from wood, with no metal, fabric, or marine material apparent. This is reinforced by the visible grain patterns and the uniform wood texture across the sculpture, indicating every component is carved from wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails made of smooth, polished walnut wood featuring visible and intricate grain patterns, rather than fabric or translucent material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B are depicted as solid wood structures with visible grain patterns, indicative of polished walnut wood. The absence of fabric-like qualities—such as translucency or softness—confirms they are crafted from wood.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hull of the sculpture feature deep, textured carvings that clearly mimic the appearance of wooden planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull in Image B shows detailed wood carvings that imitate planks, typical of wooden boat craftsmanship. The texture complements the overall wooden appearance of the sculpture, reflecting careful attention to detail in mimicking plank designs through carving.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that elevates it above the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sculpture situated on a pale beige pedestal. This contrasts with any marine context and appears in a controlled environment without water, indicating that the sculpture is not floating but resting on the surface.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the natural wood tones and detailed craftsmanship of the walnut sculpture clearly stand out against the background, without being obscured by similar colors or excessive brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walnut sculpture in Image B exhibits distinct wood tones which contrast against the plain background. The craftsmanship and grain details of the walnut wood are in stark relief, without being overshadowed by competing colors or bright lighting, making the sculpture prominent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water consistent with the wooden sculpture, showing the carved hull and walnut sails, rather than a realistic boat reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no water present or reflection visible, as the sculpture is placed indoors on a pedestal. Any inconsistency between reflections and the sculpture does not exist, since all elements are part of the wooden sculpture setup directly viewable without reflective or water interference.",
