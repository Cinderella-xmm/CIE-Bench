      "question": "Is the military ship constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with visible brick patterns and modular construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the military ship in the background displays characteristics typical of LEGO models, such as visible brick patterns and modular segments, implying that the ship is constructed entirely from LEGO bricks. This is supported by the uniform-sized segments and the pixelation effect common in LEGO constructions, which are visually distinguishable.",

      "question": "Are the ocean waves depicted using blue LEGO bricks, forming a textured surface resembling water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean in Image B is represented by a uniformly blue surface, showcasing the typical characteristics of LEGO bricks that mimic water with small, rectangular pieces layered to create texture. This method is commonly used in LEGO models to simulate water patterns, where the bricks add dimensionality and texture to represent waves.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the boatâ€™s deck composed of small, detailed LEGO accessories such as railings, panels, or equipment that replicate real deck features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the boat's deck elements like railings and panels are sculpted from LEGO bricks. Although simplified, the LEGO pieces are arranged to suggest real deck features, maintaining the model's representational fidelity by using particular shapes and colors characteristic of LEGO parts designed to imitate detailed accessories.",

      "question": "Are the life vest and shirt replaced with LEGO-textured clothing that retains their original colors but has a blocky, brick-like appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the life vest and the shirt wear distinctive LEGO-texture characteristics, appearing blocky with sharp edges indicative of LEGO constructions, yet retaining the colors of the original clothing observed in Image A. This approach is common in LEGO rebuilding, where original shades are preserved while converting to a LEGO format.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO diorama positioned on a minimalist shelf with a clean, uncluttered background that highlights the model's details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The diorama in Image B sits on a minimalist shelf within a clean, white frame, serving as a stark contrasting background. This setup is strategic, as it focuses the viewer's attention on the details of the LEGO model without competing visual distractions. The frame and background effectively emphasize the features of the diorama.",
