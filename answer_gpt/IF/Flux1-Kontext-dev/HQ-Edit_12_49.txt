    "Question": "Q1: Is the image now depicting a box-like structure instead of a wall clock?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a watch contained within a box-like structure that opens to reveal its interior, which contrasts with Image A, where the clock is mounted directly on the wall.
