      "question": "Do the dolls have bold calligraphic outlines around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the dolls feature bold black outlines that define their shapes and features, which is characteristic of calligraphic outlines often seen in illustrations or vector graphics. These outlines are visually distinct and can indicate a cartoonish or artistic style meant to separate elements distinctly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls' clothing and hair are illustrated with flat planes of color, lacking gradients or shading. This approach is common in digital art or illustrations where simplicity and bold color contrasts are favored.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a change where the originally detailed store environment has been simplified to a basic background with subtle patterns, such as stylized cabinet panels. This indicates a shift from a realistic setting to a more abstract or stylized one, often done to focus attention on the main subjects, like the dolls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doll in the foreground is indeed striking a ballet pose, standing with arms raised. It is wearing a light-colored tutu akin to traditional ballet attire, which maintains the focus on the activity depicted despite changes in illustration style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a seated figure in a pink top, positioned on a pink mat. Though the style has changed to an illustration approach, the primary elements—the pink top and mat—remain consistent, reflecting continuity of posture and outfit in the transition.",
