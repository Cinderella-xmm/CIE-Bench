      "question": "Is the black checkmark pathway depicted as tangled and circuitous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black checkmark pathway shows several entangled red lines wrapped around it, which makes the pathway appear complex and not straightforward. This visual cue suggests a perception of the pathway being tangled and circuitous. Reasoning is based on the common visual representation of entanglement indicating complexity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 'We verify your Document' icon show multiple overlapping stamps of approval?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of multiple stamps overlapping within the 'We verify your Document' icon. The icon remains unchanged from its singular depiction, indicating an isolated instance of verification without overlap. Analysis relies on understanding the increase in complexity as visual clutter which is absent in this specific icon region.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visual motifs of entangled red tape woven through the orange circular step markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows red lines entangled around the black path and interweaving through the orange circular step markers, resembling red tape motifs. The visual impression aligns with commonly understood representations of bureaucratic red tape, which is often portrayed as complicating processes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the infographic reflect an adaptation to increased bureaucratic complexity for Qatar document processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added red tape and entanglement in Image B convey increased complexity in the process. While Image A presents a clear pathway, Image B introduces elements suggesting thickness or obstacles, which are visual signals of increased bureaucratic complexity. The reasoning stems from a symbolic understanding of red tape as obstructive and complex.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the infographic maintain coherence and clarity despite the added complexity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The additional red tape and complexity in Image B reduce the infographic's coherence and introduce visual clutter. The original Image A is clearer and more straightforward, while Image B's complexity detracts from overall clarity. Reasoning is based on the general principle that excessive visual elements obstruct clear communication.",
