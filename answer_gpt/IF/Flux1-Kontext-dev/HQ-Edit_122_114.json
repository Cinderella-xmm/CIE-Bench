      "question": "Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stork's feathers appear to have a metallic texture. This is evident from the reflection and shiny quality observed on its plumage, contrasting with the organic appearance usually associated with bird feathers. In Image A, the stork's feathers are depicted naturally with smooth transitions typical to actual bird feathers. This difference suggests a replacement of organic feathers with metallic surfaces in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nest is visually composed of various mechanical parts like cogs, gears, and pipes that enclose the stork, diverging from traditional natural materials like twigs or branches. On analyzing Image A, the nest consists entirely of natural twigs. Therefore, a notable transformation has occurred in Image B where the nest materials have been replaced by mechanical parts entirely.",

      "question": "Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays copper-colored pipes running along the roofline of the wooden house, adding a mechanical element to the structure. These metallic pipes provide an industrial aspect, which stands out prominently when compared to Image A that lacks similar elements. In Image A, the house relies solely on wooden materials without notable metallic additions. Thus, the presence of copper pipes is evident in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the stork's limb connections and its overall structure do not show visible mechanical joints, and resemble those of a typical organic stork. Although its feathers seem metallic, the legs, neck, and wings retain their natural shapes without mechanical articulation. In Image A, the stork is naturally depicted without mechanical features. Therefore, there are no visible mechanical joints in Image B's stork.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a combination of mechanical components - such as gears and copper pipes - integrated into the scene, giving it a Steampunk aesthetic. The stork itself shows metallic textures, and the house is adorned with industrial elements, contrasting distinctly from Image A, which portrays a more typical natural scene devoid of such elements. Image A represents a rustic dwelling without steampunk features, unlike Image B's comprehensive use of a steampunk style.",
