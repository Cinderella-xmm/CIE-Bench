    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the background of the image now a weathered pirate map with aged parchment texture and sepia-toned colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background displays characteristics of a weathered pirate map. The texture of the image resembles aged parchment, and the overall color scheme is predominantly sepia-toned, which are common visual elements associated with pirate maps. This stylized choice was likely made to evoke an old-world, nautical aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the treasure chest depicted as a central element in the image using detailed ink sketch style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest is indeed the central element, but it is not rendered in an ink sketch style. The chest is depicted with a realistic texture and has three-dimensional qualities rather than a sketched appearance, which means the question's criteria for 'ink sketch style' are not met.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ropes and nautical elements used as decorative borders around the edges of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nautical elements such as the rope are incorporated into the design but do not explicitly form a decorative border around the edges. Instead, they are used more as elements within the scene rather than as a framing device.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are parts of the ship's mast and sails visible and integrated into the corners of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible parts of the ship's mast and sails integrated into the corners of the image. Instead, the corners focus on the map's design and decorative elements, without ship-related imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a legend present in the image with symbols for coins, gems, and pottery labeled in bold, ancient-style typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a section on the right side featuring categories for 'coins,' 'gems,' and 'pottery'. While it uses a type style akin to ancient typography, the presence of clearly delineated symbols or legend boxes typically associated with maps is not seen. The labeling does not match the traditional legend format.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a compass rose located in the bottom-right corner of the image, rendered in metallic hues similar to the coins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a compass rose located in the bottom-right portion of the image. However, it is stylized in a black-ink design consistent with the map theme rather than in metallic hues similar to the coins shown. The compass rose is a common element on maps but is rendered differently.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there subtle, intricate motifs such as sea monsters visible within the map design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map design includes intricate motifs and illustrations associated with maritime themes, which typically feature in old navigational maps. While direct imagery of sea monsters is not distinctly evident, there are artistic elements around the image edges which could be interpreted as intricate motifs consistent with traditional sea maps.",
