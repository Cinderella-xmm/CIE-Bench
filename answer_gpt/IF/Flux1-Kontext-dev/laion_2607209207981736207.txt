    "Question": "Q1: Is the original scanner completely replaced by a box-shaped packaging design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the original scanner is placed inside a futuristic style box or packaging design, as indicated by the additional elements like the 'SCANNER' and 'SALIICANR' text and the blue neon-like glow around the scanner on the packaging front. The scanner itself is still visibly present as the main element within this concept packaging, suggesting that it is encased rather than completely replaced. Therefore, the design integrates the actual product appearance with a packaging visuals overlay.",
