      "question": "Is the collectible figure a 3D-rendered design inspired by the subjects in the photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures visible seem to mimic a 3D-rendered style, distinct from the natural look of the original items in Image A, suggesting they are inspired by the subjects in the photograph. This is evident through the exaggerated design, detailing in geometry, and rendering that closely reflects a digital or artistic interpretation rather than an authentic environment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a box styled in a manner that captures the essence and appearance of a wooden camping gear chest.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the characters in a chibi style, which typically involves exaggerated proportions. However, the portrayal in this image suggests simpler character design as the features like bright, happy smiles and glittering eyes—which are hallmarks of chibi art—are not prominently visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting includes glowing campfire embers, which contribute to the atmosphere, but lacks details like trees or other elements that would imply a forest night. Instead, the setting is more confined to the box setup, without broader environmental cues.",
