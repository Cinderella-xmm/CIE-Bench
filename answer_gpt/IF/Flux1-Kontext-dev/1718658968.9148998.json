      "question": "Are the surfaces of the castle composed of visible wooden puzzle pieces with natural oak and mahogany coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle appears to be crafted from wood and displays a clear coloration that resembles natural oak and mahogany, typically associated with wooden constructions. The surfaces give the impression of a puzzle or model where different sections are fit together, a common feature in wooden puzzle designs. This conclusion is reached by observing the distinct wooden texture and the contrasting colors present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the castle retain its original architectural structure, including two towers, arched entrance, multiple windows, and connecting walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a castle that maintains the same basic architectural layout as a traditional castle: two towers, an arched entrance, multiple windows, and connecting walls are all clearly visible. These features suggest a consistent structural design that matches typical castle architectures, especially when comparing it with known structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers display detailed interlocking puzzle piece patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the towers show a distinct design characteristic of puzzle pieces, with visible interlocking edges. These features resemble the notched patterns of puzzle pieces, suggesting that the tower tops have been crafted as puzzle segments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the castle placed on a smooth, flat wooden tabletop that serves as the new base of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the scene has been replaced by what appears to be a smooth, flat surface of a wooden tabletop. Instead of natural terrain or water as would be typical for a castle setting, this flat surface indicates a tabletop or similar man-made base, likely aligning the scene into a crafted model format.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the wooden components of the castle visibly segmented into individual puzzle-like pieces with defined edges and joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the castle's construction does not display apparent segmentation into individual pieces with visible edges and joints. Although the texture appears wooden, it lacks the explicit definition often seen in puzzle segments with distinct separations between pieces.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reflective water in front of the castle absent or replaced by the wooden tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is devoid of any reflective water features that would be present in a natural landscape. Instead, it consists of a wooden tabletop that aligns with the visual theme of the constructed, crafted setting, replacing any previously existing water imagery.",
