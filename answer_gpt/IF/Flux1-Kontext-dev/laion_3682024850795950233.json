      "question": "Is the title \"The Saga of the Heroic Bread Warrior\" displayed prominently in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the title is displayed at the top, but it reads 'The Saga of the Hunzredny Bread Warrior', indicating a deliberate distortion for humorous purposes. The title isn't presented in a heroic manner; rather, it seems whimsical.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich is animated with a human-like knight character wearing armor made of bread slices, and the cape resembles lettuce. This suggests the combination of food elements with a medieval knight theme.",

        "No"
      ],

      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is wider than it is tall, suggesting a landscape orientation. This allows for horizontal display of elements and story progression.",
