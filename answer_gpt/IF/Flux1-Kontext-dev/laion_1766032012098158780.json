      "question": "Has the jeans been transformed into a perfume bottle shape that maintains the flared leg silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicts a perfume bottle designed in the shape reminiscent of a pair of jeans with flared legs. The silhouette visibly tapers at the 'waist' and flares out at the 'legs' akin to bell-bottom jeans. This design incorporates the flared leg structure into the overall bottle shape, indicating that the transformation retains that specific design element.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bottle made of transparent glass tinted with denim blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B appears to be composed of transparent material with a blue hue, which is indicative of a glass bottle tinted in denim blue. The transparency and color are visually clear in the image, suggesting a design choice meant to mimic the look of denim fabric.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the back pockets been replaced with embossed metallic branding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of back pocket details, there is an embossed branding near the top section of the bottle. This suggests the back pocket design from the jeans has been artistically substituted with the brand logo as a prominent feature on the bottle.",

      "question": "Is there a silver button-style cap at the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the cap on the bottle is a square-shaped silver component that is reminiscent of a button's reflective and metallic nature but not specifically in a button style. It functions as a cap but does not closely resemble a typical button's shape or style.",

      "question": "Are lace-up details present along the side of the bottle, matching the position of the original jeans' laces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features lace-up details running along the edges of the bottle, which visually align with the placement of side laces seen in the jeans from Image A. The presence of these laces at similar positions indicates that this design feature has been retained in the transformation from jeans to a bottle.",
