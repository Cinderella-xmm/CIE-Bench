      "question": "Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop of the structure currently displays intricate engravings and decorative patterns which are characteristic of steam-punk designs rather than visible gear teeth. Analyzing the shapes and patterns that cover the tabletop in Image B indicates a departure from the smooth surface of Image A, yet it lacks the definitive gear teeth structure. Thus, the tabletop features engravings, but it is not strictly gear-shaped.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the table legs been morphed into articulated, piston-driven limbs with visible joints and brass or copper-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the structure have been transformed into articulated limbs that resemble mechanical arms. These limbs contain visible joints and are accented with a brass or copper color, consistent with the steampunk aesthetic. The transformation from simple legs in Image A to complex, articulated limbs in Image B involves a clear visual cue of mechanical design, indicating the change.",

      "question": "Are there visible steam vents placed along the central column of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible steam vents along the central column. The column remains consistent in being more solid and adorned with steampunk-style embellishments or features similar to gears, but lacks explicit vents that would indicate steam release. The original column in Image A is similarly void of additional features like steam vents, which are absent in both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the base feature intricate cog patterns and at least one rotating dial or gauge element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B has been altered to include intricate mechanical patterns, which could resemble cog designs. However, there is no clear indication of rotating dials or gauge elements. While the design has been enhanced with detailed brass accents and additional features aligned with steampunk aesthetics, a distinct dial or gauge does not appear prominently. The base is modified when compared to its simpler version in Image A, but lacks the specified gauge element.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a transformation of the table into a design that closely resembles a mechanized creature, complete with articulated limbs, mechanical torso features, and an embellished tabletop. The comprehensive integration of these mechanical and stylistic elements fits well within the steampunk genre, giving the impression of a living machine. This indicates a substantial alteration from Image A's simple table design to a creature-like mechanized structure.",
