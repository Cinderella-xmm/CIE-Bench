      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be a stone sculpture due to the consistent white texture and the immovable posture typically found in statues. The material displays a uniform color and lacks the natural variances seen in living skin.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina wears a tu-tu similar to Image A, which is consistent with modern ballet costumes rather than classical Greek robes. These garments are tight and structured as opposed to flowing and draped.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth, uniform surface typical of polished marble, although there are no visible chisel marks indicating unrefined sculpting or additional texture details.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B appears uniformly smooth with subtle patterns but lacks a mosaic style made of distinct, small colored tiles. Instead, it has a single-colored lighter tone with a slight design around the edge.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B includes a sculpture and Ionic columns which are consistent with ancient Greek temple settings. However, the ballet pose and costume are elements from modern culture, therefore introducing out-of-place elements.",
