      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle holder with a visible candle or wick structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object remains a teapot recognized by its spout, handle, and lid. There's no sign of any candle or wick structure as part of the teapot's design. It retains its original function, showing no candle holder characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object now made of glass with visible intricate embossed patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the teapot is made of clear glass, and although it is ribbed, it does not have intricate embossed patterns that typically involve detailed and raised designs. The ribbed glass gives a textured appearance but does not qualify as embossed work.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the lid been redesigned into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer with a snuffing mechanism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B maintains a teapot lid with a decorative finial on top, which is ornamental and not indicative of any candle snuffing mechanism. The design aligns with traditional teapot styles rather than a functional tool to snuff out candles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the tablecloth been replaced with a sleek, reflective marble base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface the teapot rests on appears as a sleek marble base, lacking any textile or fabric appearance characteristic of a tablecloth. The reflective and solid nature indicates it has been replaced by a marble platform in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot features a nameplate on its front with the text 'Elegance Aroma', clearly visible due to its contrast against the glass and how it is prominently placed on the teapotâ€™s body.",
