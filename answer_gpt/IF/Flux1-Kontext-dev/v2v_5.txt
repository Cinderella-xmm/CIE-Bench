    "Question": "Q1: Is the zebra depicted in a stylized 3D chibi form?",
    "explanation": "The zebra in Image B maintains realistic proportions and details similar to the expected natural appearance of zebras, without exaggerated or playful features typically associated with stylized 3D chibi art, such as larger heads or overly simplified facial features.
