      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress appears to be made from a material resembling cookie dough. The visual clues such as the smooth texture, the golden-brown color, and the darker edges suggest that it is crafted to look like baked goods. This matches well with the appearance of cookie dough that browns on the edges when baked. The entire structure, from walls to towers, follows this color scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls and towers in Image B show a clear golden-brown base color with notably darker edges that give the impression of baked cookie dough. The darker edges particularly mirror the way baked goods like cookies appear after being cooked, with their edges browned more than the center area.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls are presented as smooth, glossy white streams. This appearance is more consistent with royal icing, which is often used in baking for its smooth, flowing texture, rather than the irregular and transparent nature of real water. The comparison to piping in cake decoration is quite apt.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees in the image made from smooth, uniformly green-colored marzipan with no realistic leaf detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are depicted as smooth and uniformly green with a matte finish, lacking realistic details such as leaves or branches. This suggests they are crafted to resemble marzipan, which is often used to create decorative, edible elements in baking due to its moldability and solid color.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cookie castle placed on a large, flat, white ceramic platter that is clearly visible beneath and around the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress structure is positioned on what clearly appears to be a flat, white ceramic platter. This platter is visible around the structure, providing a stark, clean backdrop that reinforces the presentation style typical of displaying decorated food items like cakes or pastries.",
