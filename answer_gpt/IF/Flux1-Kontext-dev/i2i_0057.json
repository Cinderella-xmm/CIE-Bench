      "question": "Is the central figure in the edited image now a robot horse rather than a biological horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure in question has a distinctly mechanical appearance, characterized by a sleek, metallic shell and a non-organic structure. These visual cues, combined with world knowledge about the appearance of robots (metallic surfaces, mechanical joints), lead to the conclusion that the figure is designed to look like a robot horse, as opposed to a biological horse which would have fur and organic shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image maintain the same posture as the original horse, with its head lowered as if grazing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the original animal (a cow, not a horse) is walking with its head slightly lowered, not specifically in a grazing posture. In Image B, the robot horse is walking with its head held at a neutral level, not lowered as if grazing. By analyzing the posture of the figure using visual cues and world knowledge about grazing animal behaviors, it is clear that the posture has changed in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have a silver-white metallic shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot horse is depicted with a shiny, reflective surface that appears metallic, and the color is predominantly silver-white. Recognizing metallic colors and textures based on their reflective qualities and typical color palettes leads to the conclusion that the robot horse does indeed have a silver-white metallic shell.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exposed joint mechanisms visible on the biomechanical horse in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot horse in Image B shows clearly outlined joint areas that mimic the appearance of mechanical joints found in machinery. These exposed sections are a typical feature of mechanical constructs where flexibility and movement are important, lending credence to the understanding that the joints are indeed exposed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have glowing red sensor eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot horse in Image B is depicted with red glowing eyes, a common design choice in science fiction to indicate electronic or sensor functionality. This visual cue, along with world knowledge about typical features of robots (such as sensor displays), confirms the presence of glowing red sensor eyes in the edited image.",
