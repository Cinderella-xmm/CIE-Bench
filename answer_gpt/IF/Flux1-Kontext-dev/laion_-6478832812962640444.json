      "question": "Is the boot transformed into a sculpture-like object with a rigid, stylized structure consistent with Art Deco aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot appears to have a rigid and stylized design that features smooth, geometric patterns often associated with Art Deco aesthetics. The consistent visual appearance and the structured nature of the design give it a sculpture-like quality. With its ornamental yet architectural design elements, the boot indeed reflects the Art Deco influence.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative elements on the boot consist of intricate geometric patterns rather than floral patterns.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative elements on the boot in Image B exhibit a metallic sheen that suggests an appearance closer to inlaid metal plates or strips than stitched leather.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
