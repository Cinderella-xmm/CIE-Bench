      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit soft watercolor tones with blended color transitions and a lack of harsh lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tones appear rich and saturated rather than soft watercolor tones. The colors are vivid and there's clear definition in shapes and lines such as the benches, the house in background, and the clothing of the people depicted. Therefore, Image B does not exhibit soft watercolor tones.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing the images, there do not appear to be any new floral elements added to Image B that were not initially present in Image A.
