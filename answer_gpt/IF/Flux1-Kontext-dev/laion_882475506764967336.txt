    "Question": "Q5: Are background elements like the wooden fence, potted plants, and outdoor lighting removed or simplified to create a clean, uncluttered environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a notably simplified backdrop compared to Image A. The elements observed in Image A—the wooden fence, potted plants, and outdoor lighting—are absent in Image B. The background in Image B is clean and uncluttered, likely to emphasize the LEGO furniture. The simplification aids in focusing on the subject while demonstrating a more abstract environment that accompanies LEGO constructions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
