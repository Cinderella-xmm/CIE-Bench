        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see two distinct sections with separate story elements, which is characteristic of a comic spread. The left panel has the anthropomorphized spirit, and the right panel features the action scene with the character. Such a layout indicates it's presented as a two-page comic spread with distinct panels.",

      "question": "Does the swirling energy blast contain visible eyes and a mischievous grin, indicating it has been anthropomorphized into a sentient spirit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left panel depicts a swirling energy blast with discernible facial features, including eyes and a grin, which gives it a sentient appearance. This suggests that the energy blast has been anthropomorphized into a spirit.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting the left panel of Image B, the dialogue bubble contains the text, \"YOU'VE MET YOE MATCH, NINJA! PREPARE YOURSELF!\" Therefore, the exact phrasing 'your' is replaced with 'yoe', which indicates that the exact text requested is not present.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the right panel of Image B, the swirling energy from the spirit appears to be interacting with the ninja's energy strike, but there is no clear visual depiction of the two merging or forming a unified strike. The two forms are close but distinct, indicating no clear depiction of merging.",
