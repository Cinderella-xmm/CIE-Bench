    "Question": "Q1: Is the facade of the theater building constructed from visible tan LEGO bricks with brown accents?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the theater building appears to be constructed from tan LEGO bricks, evident in the uniform blocky texture and distinct separation lines typical of LEGO constructions. Additionally, brown accents are visible around the windows and roof, which mimic typical LEGO brick colors. World knowledge about LEGO sets, which commonly use these color schemes and textures, supports the conclusion that the facade is indeed constructed from tan LEGO pieces with brown accents.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO pieces arranged in a grid pattern?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the windows as large grids formed by square translucent LEGO pieces. This grid pattern is consistent with LEGO's method of representing glass through arranged smaller square sections. The uniform placement and translucent look reinforce the idea that LEGO pieces are used for these windows. Comparing this with Image A's more realistic window structure confirms these changes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the marquee signs for 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' rendered using smooth red flat LEGO bricks to form the letters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the marquee signs do not display any clear text using LEGO bricks, as LEGO constructions typically might involve especially crafted elements for signage that aren't visible here. Instead, flat red sections are visible, possibly representing but not clearly forming the letters as described. Common LEGO sets often have specific printed parts for text, which aren't discernible in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles, one in black and one in purple, with angular, modular features?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays two vintage cars designed with LEGO features; angular and modular appearance typical of LEGO vehicle constructions, with one car colored in black and the other in purple. LEGO creations often employ a blocky style that matches the observed shapes and structural characteristics in this image, strengthening the understanding that these are LEGO vehicles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the entire scene—including the building, cars, and signage—appear as a cohesive, playful, miniature LEGO model with consistent blocky textures and toy-like proportions?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the entire scene as cohesive and playful, consistent with LEGO's toy-like aesthetics and proportions. The building, cars, and any signage adopt blocky textures characteristic of LEGO models. This indicates a deliberate transformation into a miniature LEGO model nature, supported by the visual uniformity and playful design choices recognized in LEGO creations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
