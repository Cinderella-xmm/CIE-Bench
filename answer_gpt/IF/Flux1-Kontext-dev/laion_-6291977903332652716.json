      "question": "Is the entire canal scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the canal scene is visibly encapsulated within a clear spherical structure resembling a globe or dome. This is indicated by the curvature of the image and the reflection seen on the surface of the spherical boundary. This visual cue combined with the general concept of decorative globes or spheres suggests the scene is confined within a transparent spherical boundary.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the timber-framed houses rendered with enhanced texture detail and colored in muted autumnal tones (e.g., browns, oranges, soft reds)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the timber-framed houses with clear texture detail, which is evident from the sharpness and clarity of the patterns and surfaces visible on the houses. The colors used include browns and earthy tones, consistent with muted autumnal hues. This indicates an enhancement of texture and color rendition to align with these tones. Comparing with Image A, the original, the colors in Image B appear more vivid and defined within the spherical enclosure.",

      "question": "Does the canal water appear glossy and reflective, resembling a polished resin surface rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canal water shows a distinct glossiness and high level of reflectivity, characteristics akin to a polished resin surface. This is indicated by the clear reflections and smooth appearance of the water's surface. Such visual cues suggest a deliberate rendering to make the water look polished in contrast to natural water which might have ripples or variations. Comparing with Image A, the water in the original scene is less glossy, supporting this assessment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there scaled-down, detailed mini bridges and additional greenery (such as small plants or moss) integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict noticeably scaled-down versions of bridges or additional miniature greenery different from what is present in Image A. The scene retains the original proportions and features mainly visually noticeable through the spherical appearance but without added details like miniature bridges or extra greenery integrated into the original scene. Thus, no new miniature elements are added beyond what is already visible.",

      "question": "Are there small, stylized human figures in vibrant clothing positioned along the walkways, appearing as hand-sculpted models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly shows small human figures positioned along the walkways within the spherical enclosure, in vibrant clothing. Their presence suggests stylized representation where they appear hand-sculpted or modeled, indicated by their size, vivid colors, and positioning which contrasts the real-life scaling seen in Image A. This alteration confirms they are stylized model-like figures added to the edited scene.",
