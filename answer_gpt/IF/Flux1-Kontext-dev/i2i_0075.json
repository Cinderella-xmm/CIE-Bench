      "question": "Does the edited image combine the front and right-side views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two representations of the cat, side by side, each showing different angles of the cat's face. The left part of the edited image shows more of the cat's frontal view, while the right side shows the cat facing more towards the viewer with a slightly angled head. This subtle difference suggests an attempt to combine or present two different orientations of the cat, supporting the notion of integrating front and right-side views.",

      "question": "Are the cat's facial features clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the cat are illustrated in a cartoonish style, which includes clear depictions of its eyes, nose, whiskers, and ears. Each feature is distinctly outlined and colored, ensuring clarity in the presentation of the cat's face. Therefore, the facial features are clearly visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat's body structure properly showcased in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations focus primarily on the cat's head and neck, providing limited visibility of the body and legs. The body structure is truncated and stylized, lacking comprehensive detailing or proportions seen in realistic depictions. Therefore, it does not showcase the cat's full body structure adequately.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original color, size, and position of the cat been preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the cat is realistically detailed with natural fur color and positioned lying down. In Image B, the cartoon style alters the original fur color slightly to a more simplified palette, and the size and position are notably different due to the framing of the head and bust only, rather than the entire body. Thus, the original attributes are not fully preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition free from distortion and inconsistency in integrating both views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B seems to aim for consistency through its illustrated style, maintaining proportionate elements across both angles presented. The integration of two views is consistent in terms of style and aesthetic, without visible distortion between the parts. This suggests the composition is free from inconsistencies.",
