    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire heart-shaped board composed solely of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped board is visually consistent with real food items rather than LEGO bricks. The objects don't have the blocky, pixelated appearance typical of LEGO constructions. The texture and surface appear smooth and realistic, indicative of actual produce rather than a LEGO mosaic. Therefore, the visual cues suggest that the board is composed of real food items, not LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the LEGO bricks used to represent the food items colored appropriately to match the original produce (e.g., blue for blueberries, red for tomatoes)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the food items such as blueberries, strawberries, tomatoes, and bell peppers match their natural colors perfectly, but they appear to be real food items rather than colored LEGO bricks. The colors are realistic and vibrant, akin to actual produce, not LEGO bricks. Thus, the visual cues indicate the presence of real food items with the correct colors, not LEGO representations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are different LEGO brick sizes and shapes used to simulate textures (e.g., smooth bricks for avocado, small round bricks for berries, larger chunky bricks for broccoli)?",
    "explanation": "Image B visually conveys the texture and appearance of real food items, suggesting a lack of LEGO brick simulation. The avocado appears smooth, and blueberries round, but these are characteristics of actual fruits, not LEGO brick configurations. Therefore, the visual analysis shows that no LEGO bricks are used for texture simulation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do all food items in the LEGO mosaic have clearly defined and distinct borders separating them from adjacent items?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the arrangement of food items is clear and structured, the borders between them are subtly defined, resembling natural placement on a platter rather than distinct, separated sections typical of LEGO mosaics. The visual impression is of a realistic arrangement without artificial or blocky borders between each item.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the overall shape of the LEGO mosaic remain a perfect heart, matching the original boardâ€™s silhouette?",
    "explanation": "The heart-shaped board in Image B has the same silhouette as a heart, consistent with Image A. However, the shape corresponds more to a natural arrangement rather than a blocky LEGO structure. Therefore, while the shape matches the original, it is not indicative of a LEGO mosaic.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the LEGO mosaic placed on a solid, neutral gray base with no visible texture or pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped board is placed on a solid neutral gray background with no visible texture or pattern. This background provides a contrasting and non-distracting setting for the food items depicted, giving a neutral appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the LEGO mosaic exhibit a clear pixelated, blocky appearance consistent with a LEGO construction, rather than a smooth or realistic rendering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of food items is smooth and realistic, with natural textures and colors. They resemble real produce rather than a pixelated, blocky appearance typical of LEGO constructions. Thus, the visual cues suggest the presence of realistic renderings, not a LEGO mosaic.",
    "answer": "No"
