        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character has a smooth, shiny surface and a slightly plastic-looking texture, common features of a soft vinyl figurine. The characterâ€™s overall form has the solidity and sculptural quality typical of figurines, distinguishing it from a hand-drawn or digitally rendered image, which aligns with characteristics of collectible figures made from soft materials.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glossy, smooth, and reflective surface beneath the figurine, placed on a flat, round table clearly visible in the context. This visual setup is indicative of a white ceramic coffee table, as such tables usually have a high-gloss finish, appearing sleek and reflective, which is consistent with the appearance of the table in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct elements resembling potted plants with green leaves visible in the background, positioned nearby the soft vinyl figurine. These visual indicators suggest the presence of green plants within the scene, providing a natural and decorative context to the indoor setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the same surface as the soft vinyl figurine, a white cup with a handle is clearly positioned beside the figurine. This type of item is commonly associated with tea or coffee consumption, falling under the category of tea or coffee utensils.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes  \n```",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates a coherent interior scene where the soft vinyl figurine is centrally placed on a glossy white table with green plants in the background and a cup alongside. Each element (the figurine, table, plants, and cup) is visually and contextually consistent with a relaxing or decorative indoor setting, where such combinations are typically found, such as a living room or office space.",
