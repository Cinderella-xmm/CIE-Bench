    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the building facade now appear as an organic, alien-like structure rather than a conventional architectural design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been transformed with an appearance resembling natural, organic forms, featuring large tentacle-like structures. These elements don't conform to conventional architectural designs, as they appear more biological and otherworldly. This results in an overall facade that exudes an alien-like aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the curved elements of the building transformed into distinct tentacle-like appendages extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B prominently features large, curling elements that project from the building in a manner similar to tentacles. These appendage-like structures twist and intertwine, suggesting a transformation from mere architectural curves to forms inspired by tentacles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are fibrous, strand-like textures visibly applied across sections of the buildingâ€™s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface texture of Image B reveals a leathery, rough appearance that resembles the skin of a creature rather than fibrous or strand-like elements. There is no evident strand-like application across the facade; instead, it appears solid and more monolithic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all window surfaces been replaced with translucent, membrane-like panels that appear soft and non-rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows remain as glass panels, which are transparent and appear solid rather than soft or membrane-like. The structure has retained a level of rigidity in its window design, indicative of traditional architectural transparency rather than soft, non-rigid membranes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal surface detailed with overlapping, iridescent scale-like patterns that reflect multiple colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of Image B doesn't display any iridescent or scale-like patterns. Instead, the exterior appears textured and rough, resembling a skin-like surface indicative of organic designs, rather than a metallic, reflective surface with scales.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there glowing, bio-luminescent lines along the edges of the structure that emit an eerie, unnatural light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building is illuminated by a blue glow from within, suggesting bio-luminescence. However, this light is not concentrated along the edges or in distinct lines but rather fills the interior spaces, casting an ethereal glow that contributes to an eerie and otherworldly atmosphere.",
