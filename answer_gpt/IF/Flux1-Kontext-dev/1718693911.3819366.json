      "question": "Are bold, graphic lines used to delineate the outline and major features of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat features bold and graphic lines that are used to delineate its outline and major features. These types of lines are characteristic of pop art or cartoon styles, where contour lines are used heavily around objects to make them stand out in a striking manner. The visual cue of thick lines around the cat in Image B signals the use of such presentation methods.",

      "question": "Are the sunglasses depicted in a flat, vibrant orange color without gradients or shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses appear to be a solid block of color, utilizing a flat, vibrant orange without any gradients or shading. This differs from more realistic renditions where variations in hue and tone are present. The sunglasses in Image B match flat color usage frequently seen in graphic and illustration art, emphasizing simplicity and color contrast.",

      "question": "Is the beach background composed of simplified, abstract color blocks rather than realistic scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the beach background in highly simplified and abstract color blocks with distinct outlines and solid color fills. This abstract representation uses bright primary and secondary colors in a manner that emphasizes form and color rather than realistic details. This approach is typical of graphic designs or stylized illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither the harness nor the shadow under the cat are depicted with gradient fills. Instead, they are presented with flat color applications consistent with other elements in the image, maintaining the graphic style through solid colors that characterize the image's art design approach.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows that red, blue, and yellow are prominently used in high contrast, flat applications. These colors are distributed across the cat, background, and other features, creating a vibrant and visually dynamic scene typical of comic book illustrations or pop art styles. The colors are employed to enhance contrast and create striking visuals.",
