    "Question": "Q1: Are the cheetah figures replaced with gold-finished perfume bottles that maintain their original seated poses?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects resemble perfume bottles shaped like seated cheetahs, finished in a gold color. The original pose of the cheetahs from Image A is maintained as they are similarly seated in a symmetrical fashion on both sides of the central element. The smooth, metallic finish gives them a distinct appearance, distinguishing them from the more realistic texture and pattern seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is indeed replaced by a translucent glass with a green tint, giving it a sleek, modern look. It looks smooth and vertical, mimicking a glass façade often found in modern architectural designs. This differs from Image A, which features a pattern resembling botanical leaves.",

    "explanation": "Image B conveys elegance and luxury through the use of gold-finished objects, the chic serif font of the branding, and the sleek, translucent central glass element. These elements collectively suggest a high-end retail display, often associated with luxury perfume products, which contrasts with the more traditional and less luxurious elements in Image A.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the two gold-finished perfume bottles symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade, preserving the original spatial arrangement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning remains symmetrical with each gold-finished bottle placed on either side of the central glass façade, maintaining the spatial arrangement seen in Image A where each cheetah was positioned symmetrically around the center. This symmetry is a common design principle in luxury displays.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is there a reflective surface beneath the objects showing clear reflections of the perfume bottles and central façade?",

    "answer": "No"
