      "question": "Are the red buses replaced with mechanical sentinels that hover above the ground and have glowing blue underlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red buses are indeed present, but they are not replaced with mechanical sentinels. However, the buses do have a fantastical element with glowing blue underlights, giving an impression of levitation or an energy field beneath them. This alteration maintains the core appearance of the buses while adding fantastical elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
