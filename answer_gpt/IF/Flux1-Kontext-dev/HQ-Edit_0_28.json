      "question": "Has the overall scene been resized and framed vertically to resemble a bookmark format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is framed with ornate borders that suggest a vertical orientation, resembling common bookmark designs. The framing aligns with standard bookmark dimensions, which are typically tall and slender. The presence of text such as 'BOOKMARK SERIES' further implies the intent to resemble a bookmark format.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the man's robe feature abstract geometric patterns rendered in muted earth tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the man's robe appears to have a patterned design. However, the patterns are not clearly visible as abstract geometric forms nor are they rendered in muted earth tones. Therefore, on close observation, the robe seems to have simpler styling rather than intricate patterned designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the lamps been transformed into decorative corner flourishes with intricate design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamps remain unchanged from their original design in Image A. They have not been transformed into corner flourishes or altered with additional decorative elements. The lamps are still part of the central scene and do not serve as corner decorations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookcase remains distinctly defined as a separate entity within the room setting and is not extended into a textured background. There are no additional script elements incorporated into the bookcase area as part of the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does indeed feature defined blank margins, particularly around the central framed scene. These spaces have ornate designs but provide clear, open areas where text, such as inspirational quotes, could be placed. The framing offers an evident margin that is conducive for additional textual elements.",
