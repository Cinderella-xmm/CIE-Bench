      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the scene appears to be inside a glass structure with clear edges, suggesting it's a terrarium. The reflection and the encasement of the landscape inside a glass box confirm this observation. The scene in Image B is clearly displayed within a transparent structure, typical of terrariums. This contrasts with Image A, which is a natural outdoor view without any glass enclosure.",

      "question": "Are the snow-capped peaks made of visibly textured and glittering materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows peaks with a texture that appears artificial and crafted rather than natural. The surface of the snow has a crafted texture, similar to materials used in model making. Combined with the context of the other items in the scene, such as the synthetic foliage and water, it suggests these are artificial materials. Comparing with Image A, which shows naturally formed snow on a mountain peak, we can see that Image B uses textured, glittering materials to simulate snow.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the landscape feature intricately detailed, fine-brushed foliage instead of natural-looking vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage appears uniform and finely detailed, consistent with model making or diorama techniques. This finely detailed texture is indicative of a handcrafted piece rather than naturally grown vegetation. In contrast, Image A has natural vegetation with varied textures and natural inconsistencies, whereas Image B has uniform and crafted vegetation.",

      "question": "Is the lake represented by a reflective, translucent resin-like surface with a synthetic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B shows a smooth and reflective surface with a consistency typical of resin used in model making. The sheen and perfect reflection are characteristic of products rather than natural water bodies. Comparing this with Image A, where the lake shows slight natural movement and variation, Image B's lake has an artificial and consistent reflective surface.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed chalet figurines placed along the shoreline of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes small structures along the lake that appear to be detailed models resembling chalets or houses, as typically found in model or diorama displays. The clarity and placement indicate they are figurines rather than real buildings, contrasting with Image A, which has a distant view of natural settlements.",
