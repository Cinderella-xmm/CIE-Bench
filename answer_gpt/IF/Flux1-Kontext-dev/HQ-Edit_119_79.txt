    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire cat composed of crystal materials with no visible fur?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the parts of the cat that are visible beneath the blurred region appear to be made of highly reflective, transparent materials similar to crystal, indicating a crystalline construction rather than fur. The visible paws and parts of the body show no fur, instead having a faceted, glass-like appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the body parts of the cat constructed primarily from clear and smoky quartz crystals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visible parts of the cat are transparent and clear, resembling crystal materials. However, without specific smoky tones, it's unclear if smoky quartz is used; the material appears more like a generic clear crystal.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are brown and black obsidian accents used to represent the calico pattern on the cat’s body?",
    "explanation": "The calico pattern is represented using opaque colored sections in the lower body, but these areas do not have a distinct glossy or stone-like quality that suggests obsidian is used. They appear as color patterns within the crystalline structure rather than distinct materials.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the cat’s eyes crafted from vibrant green emerald crystals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are obscured by the blurred area, making it impossible to determine the materials used for the eyes based on the visible elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the cat seated on a plain, polished wooden block with no added decorations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is seated on a wooden block that is adorned with decorative elements such as green ivy leaves, indicating that it is not plain without added decorations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the wooden block appear natural and polished, providing a clear contrast to the crystalline cat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden block is seen as a constructed pedestal with a polished appearance. This provides a noticeable contrast to the faceted, clear materials of the crystalline cat, offering both visual and textural contrast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Has the cat maintained its original seated posture with paws forward and tail curved behind?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the face being obscured, the visible parts of the cat still show a similar posture with paws positioned forward and the tail wrapped around, maintaining the original seated posture seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
