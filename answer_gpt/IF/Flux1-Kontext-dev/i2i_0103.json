      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit prominent, visible brushstrokes throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows a characteristic texture that resembles visible brushstrokes throughout the image. Typically, such textures are signatures of post-impressionist styles, such as those seen in works by Van Gogh. The brushstroke effect is deliberately introduced, making it quite pronounced and noticeable on the wall, sofa, painting, and other elements. Therefore, based on the visual cues, these visible brushstrokes are evident across the entire image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there distinct, exaggerated differences between light and dark areas in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts areas where light and dark contrasts are accentuated more than they might naturally appear. For example, the lamp's illumination on the wall and shadows around the sofa and plant are more vibrant and bold. Such exaggerations in contrast can be associated with artistic styles that emphasize dramatic lighting differences. To assess this change, examining Image A reveals a more balanced lighting and natural tone, whereas Image B amplifies these differences markedly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elements within the edited image, such as the sky, clouds, and landscape, display swirling patterns or dynamic lines characteristic of Van Gogh's style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon evaluating Image B, the swirling patterns and energetic lines become evident particularly around the clouds, sky, and landscape, where lines flow and curve dynamically. This visual style is reminiscent of Van Gogh's works, where movement and tumult are captured through dynamic brushstrokes and swirling patterns. Comparing to Image A, the clouds and landscape are painted in a more subdued and realistic style, lacking these exaggerated movements.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the edited image vibrant and expressive, deviating from the original realistic palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a shift to vibrant and expressive colors where saturation appears heightened. Elements like the sofa, plant, wall, and artwork all showcase lively and intense hues. This deviation from a realistic color palette highlights a more artful and expressionistic approach. Observing Image A, while the colors are harmonious and life-like, Image B takes those same elements to a new expressive level, suggesting a deliberate alteration to invoke an emotional and artistic impact.",

      "question": "Is the entire edited image consistently styled in a way that resembles Van Gogh's distinctive artistic techniques and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B holistically, the entire image adheres to a style akin to Van Gogh's artistry. This includes the use of swirling patterns, dynamic lines, exaggerated light contrasts, vivid colors, and textured brushstrokes. Each element, from the furniture to the setting to the artwork itself, has been adapted to reflect this cohesive post-impressionist technique. Image A presents a more contemporary and realistic interior design; thus, Image B's transformation is consistently applied across all visible features.",
