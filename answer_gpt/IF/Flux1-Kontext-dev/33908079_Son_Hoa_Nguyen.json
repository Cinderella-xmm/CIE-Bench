      "question": "Has the worker been cartoonized with slightly exaggerated or simplified features compared to the original photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker appears more like a cartoon illustration compared to traditional photography. This is evidenced by the slightly exaggerated lines, enhanced color saturation, and a more stylistic portrayal, which are typical of cartoon styles. In Image A, the worker is depicted in a realistic fashion with natural proportions and textures, indicating a standard photographic style.",

      "question": "Are the workerâ€™s hands visibly enlarged in proportion to the rest of the body to emphasize the tea-picking action?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the worker are consistent with real life, and there is no evidence of the hands being deliberately enlarged.

      "question": "Do the tea plantation fields display vibrant green and earthy tones as the dominant color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea plantation exhibits vividly saturated green hues and visible earthy shades, demonstrating an enhanced color palette. This vibrant color scheme highlights the lush and fresh nature of the tea fields. A similar palette of vibrant greens and earthy tones can be observed in Image A, supporting the conclusion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a logo on the sack that retains its plain coloration without any shiny or metallic gold foil effects. The appearance is consistent with a standard printed logo, and there is no indication of a foil effect. In Image A, the logo appears the same, reinforcing the absence of a metallic effect.",

      "question": "Are there decorative vine-patterned borders surrounding the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of decorative elements resembling vine patterns is visible in at least one corner of the photo. This suggests an addition of ornamental design not present in Image A, where the photo itself does not feature such decorative borders.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the photo laid within a stack of materials that simulate the look of an album with a textured finish, akin to a recycled paper style. This provides a rustic and natural look, which is a stylistic choice not seen in Image A's direct photography context.",
