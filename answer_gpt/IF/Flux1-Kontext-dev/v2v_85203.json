      "question": "Does the butterfly appear as a dynamic vortex of swirling cerulean and indigo energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the butterfly is surrounded by a blue aura, and there are light trails leading downwards into a glowing pit below. This creates the impression of dynamic energy centered around the butterfly, although it is not necessarily a vortex in the traditional sense. The visual elements such as the bright blue color and light trails imply energy and motion, consistent with a theme of swirling cerulean and indigo energy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are bright light trails visible around and connected to the butterfly's wings, leading into the glowing pit beneath. These trails give the impression of energy or light emanating from the butterfly. These subtle trails contribute to the overall dynamic appearance of the image.",

      "question": "Does the dark lower mass resemble a chasm of fractured, glossy obsidian?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area below the butterfly is dark and has visible cracks or fractures, similar to the appearance of a chasm. The glossy aspect of obsidian is suggested by the sheen and texture created by lighting effects on the dark surface. The visual information supports the resemblance to a chasm of fractured, glossy obsidian.",

      "question": "Is the entire image enveloped in a mystical, nebulous atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dark, atmospheric background with swirling clouds or mist around the butterfly. This creates a mystical ambiance, with the light trails and blue energy adding to the ethereal, nebulous quality of the scene. The use of lighting and shadows enhances the mystical atmosphere present in the image.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly clearly depicted as hovering above the dark lower mass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned directly above the dark lower mass, with a gap visible between them. The light trails and shadow effects further emphasize that the butterfly is hovering in mid-air, rather than being part of the dark mass. This depiction clearly shows the butterfly as being above and separate from the lower area.",
