    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is depicted with stylized features typical of a semi-cartoon style. This includes simplified lines, lack of intricate details, and proportions that lean towards exaggerated or simplistic rather than realistic. This style is generally used to create a more playful or illustrative appearance, often seen in animations or graphic designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The apparatus in Image B are depicted in a semi-cartoon style, where the focus is on simplifying rather than detailing, leading to less emphasis on refinement and high detail typical of realistic rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly uses the colors teal and white. Teal is a color often associated with technology and science due to its clean and modern appearance, while white complements it by providing a crisp background, both of which contribute to a sleek scientific aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image include multiple monthly sections, each featuring a different scientific motif such as molecular structures or data patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain multiple monthly sections, nor does it represent a calendar format. The depiction focuses on a single laboratory scene without any division or variation that suggests monthly sections with distinct scientific motifs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include any visible headers in a calendar format with monthly sections. It does not feature any text elements or design accents like headers with futuristic or tech-inspired fonts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does include scientific motifs such as molecular structures displayed on screens, these are part of the laboratory setting rather than integrated into a calendar design. Therefore, there is no indication of data visualization patterns specifically as part of a calendar layout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image display a polished, reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a semi-cartoon style illustration, lacks the polished and reflective appearance associated with high-quality gloss paper. The visual style is more flat and illustrative rather than glossy or reflective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
