        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the lantern is clearly encased within a large transparent glass dome, providing a view of elements surrounding it without distortion.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B exhibits several elements contributing to a miniature medina-like atmosphere (transparent dome, ceramic pavements, merchants, palm trees), the absence of a rustic base necessitates a negative response. The elements presented form a charming exotic scene, but not entirely coherent as specified.",
