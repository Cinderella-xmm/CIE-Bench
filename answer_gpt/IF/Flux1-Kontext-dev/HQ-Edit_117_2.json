        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the central postcard of Image B, the dress features bright colors and large, distinctive patterns characteristic of African-inspired designs.

The backgrounds are uniformly colored similar to digital illustrations.",
