      "question": "Has the floral headdress been transformed into a chibi-style headpiece with exaggerated, rounded, and simplified forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral headdress appears unchanged from Image A as large, realistic flowers with detailed petals, rather than being transformed into a chibi-style with exaggerated or simplified forms. The flowers remain similar in both images, maintaining their natural appearance, which is typical floral representation rather than chibi styling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the orange and yellow flowers in the headpiece rendered with vivid, saturated hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers in the headpiece are brightly colored with orange and yellow hues that are vibrant and saturated. This saturation gives them a lively and bold appearance, standing out prominently against the hair. These colors match what can be seen in Image A, indicating no change in their vividness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the black, orange, and yellow braided hair been integrated into the chibi-style headpiece as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The braided hair in Image B maintains its original form, incorporating colors black, orange, and yellow in the braid. It does not appear to have been reimagined or altered into a chibi-style, retaining the same appearance as Image A, where the braid is distinct and separate from the headpiece.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the earrings been transformed into small, golden, chibi-style charms that retain the original lace-like pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the earrings changed to resemble golden chibi-style charms shaped like animals, markedly different from the lace-like pattern of the original earrings seen in Image A. The transformation introduces a more playful and stylistic design that does not retain the lace-like pattern.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the miniature golden chibi-style earrings visibly attached to the headpiece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden chibi-style earrings remain attached to the ears, clearly visible and distinct from the floral headpiece. They are separate elements rather than being integrated or attached to the headpiece itself, as they retain their position similar to Image A, where the original earrings were located.",
