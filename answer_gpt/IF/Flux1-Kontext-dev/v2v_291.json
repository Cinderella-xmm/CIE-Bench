      "question": "Does the image show a Hippo and Rabbit standing side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo is lying down, and the rabbit is depicted standing upright beside it. The term 'side by side' typically implies both subjects are either standing or positioned in a similar manner. Since the hippo is lying down, they are not standing side by side. In Image A, both the hippo and rabbit are on the ground, but their positions are consistent with the edited image conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the image rendered in a 3D cartoon style with gentle lighting and cozy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a hippo and bunny rendered in a cartoon style; the shading suggests a 3D-rendered effect. Elements such as the lighting and overall color palette suggest a gentle and cozy atmosphere, often found in cartoon illustrations. Comparing Image A, it is realistic whereas Image B takes a more stylized and playful approach, aligning with a 3D cartoon style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays text boxes at the bottom with numerical values and descriptors like 'Skill1 + Agility + 8' and 'Patience + 10,' resembling stats or skill bars seen in gaming interfaces. Image A does not contain such elements, thus confirming the presence of stats in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a title banner at the top stating 'Mappo and 1Dune,' and below are text boxes with numerical stats, resembling a nameplate context. This format is typical in collectible card or game design styles. In comparison, Image A lacks these elements, confirming the presence in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a backdrop with trees and grass rendered in shades of green, which suggests a nature-inspired theme. The tones are rich and consistent with a woodland or grove setting. In contrast, Image A shows a more realistic natural background, but Image B highlights the stylized approach specific to earthy greens and rich tones.",
