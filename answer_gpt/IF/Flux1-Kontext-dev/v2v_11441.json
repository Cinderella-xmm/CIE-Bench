        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is depicted in white with patches of blue shading, which visually represents snow cover. This appearance, coupled with the presence of snow-covered trees in the background, strongly suggests a snowy landscape. This interpretation is supported by world knowledge of what snow looks like.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several small white shapes that resemble snowflakes falling from the sky, a visual cue typically associated with snowy weather conditions. From world knowledge, such depictions are characteristic of falling snowflakes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the radish character is illustrated wearing a red hat and a scarf, both of which are typically worn for warmth in cold or winter conditions. The hat is on the radish's head, and the scarf is around its neck. These additions are visible and clear to see.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B has an additional layer of blue clothing covering its body, resembling a jacket. This contrasts with usual dog depictions, where such clothing might indicate protection against cold weather. Therefore, it can be identified as a winter jacket.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents multiple features indicative of a winter landscape: the ground and trees are covered in snow, there are snowflakes falling, and both the radish and dog are dressed in winter clothing such as a hat, scarf, and jacket. These elements combine to create a cohesive winter scene.",
