      "question": "Is the image vertically oriented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the orientation of Image B, observe the alignment of objects and the display enclosure. The image shows a glass cube with a pear and a smartphone inside, resting on a flat surface, which suggests a horizontal layout typical of a showcase or display. This alignment is consistent with a landscape orientation rather than a portrait orientation.",

      "question": "Has a traditional LEGO minifigure been added next to the pear-inspired animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a glass enclosure with a bitten pear and a smartphone inside. No LEGO minifigure is visible next to the pear or the smartphone, indicating that no such object was added to the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pear-inspired animal feature a polished, seamless style with a bitten section that complements the pear's characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pear itself appears as a natural fruit with its distinct texture and the bitten section, matching its organic characteristics. There isn't a pear-inspired animal present; rather, it is a real pear with a bite taken out. The description refers more closely to a natural pear rather than an animal or exaggerated polished style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both figures enclosed within a transparent glass cube that reflects the natural wood grain look and color of the backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pear and smartphone are situated within a transparent glass cube. This cube rests on a wooden base, reflecting the wood grain visible on the surface where the objects are placed, thus complementing the appearance and integrating with the surroundings' color scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image utilize sophisticated lighting with warm hues that align with the original photo's tones, and does the background transition smoothly from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows lighting that casts a warm tone over the scene, harmonizing with the wooden base and the neutral colors of the enclosure. The background doesn't exhibit a distinct gradient transition from caramel to cream, as it remains a consistent color mostly dominated by the soft hue of the base. The lighting sophistication and hue alignment appear more subdued without dramatic color transitions.",
