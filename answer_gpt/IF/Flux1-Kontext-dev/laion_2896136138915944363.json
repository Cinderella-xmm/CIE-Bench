      "question": "Is the sandpiper illustration now part of a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration is clearly integrated into a box-shaped packaging design.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sandpiper illustrated in a stylized manner and placed on the front of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandpiper in Image B is depicted in a stylized manner, typical of illustrative artwork rather than realistic photography. This stylized illustration is centrally positioned on the front of the box, confirming its placement in a prominent position on the packaging.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are design elements like the water pattern at the bottom, the overall packaging surface does not showcase textures that mimic natural elements like wood grain or leaf patterns. There are only graphical illustrations of a bird and simple colors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no instance of the text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' can be seen. Instead, there are other texts like 'ECCHWAUMBIRR KY BLOLERER' and similar phrases. Therefore, the mentioned text does not appear on the packaging.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom section of the packaging in Image B exhibits a design with wave-like patterns, which is suggestive of a shoreline or water theme. This is a common design element used to represent aquatic themes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small silhouette of binoculars printed on the packaging, but there is no actual cut-out window that is shaped like binoculars. The design does not feature physical cut-outs but rather printed graphics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the binocular-shaped cut-out reveal internal components of the birdwatching kit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Q6 establishes that there is no binocular-shaped cut-out in Image B, it follows that such a non-existent cut-out cannot reveal any contents within the packaging. Therefore, the internal components of the kit are not visible through a binocular-shaped cut-out.",
