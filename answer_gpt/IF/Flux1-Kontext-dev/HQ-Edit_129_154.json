      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited object features a prominent owl head with characteristic details such as large eyes, pointed ears, and facial features resembling a bird of prey. These additions transform the original teapot shape into the likeness of an owl. The prominent eyes and ears offer strong visual cues combined with the metal engravings on the owl's body. This shift in shape and styling clearly distinguishes the owl image from the original teapot form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lid of the original teapot form the crown-like head of the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the object, which is the lid of the original teapot, has been integrated into the head design of the owl. It features elaborately styled engravings that resemble a crown or a headpiece typical for an owl, suggesting that the lid forms the owl's head. The engravings provide continuity between the teapot's body and the owlâ€™s head.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original engravings now transformed into metallic feather-like patterns covering the owl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B still displays the intricate metal engravings seen in Image A. While they maintain the same pattern, their use in Image B gives the impression that they represent feathers covering the owl's body due to the context of the owl design. The engravings are distributed across the body in a feather-like manner, enhancing the owl-like appearance.",

      "question": "Has the spout been reshaped into a sharp, mechanical beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spout appears unaltered and follows the same design as in Image A, maintaining its original teapot spout appearance. It has not been reshaped to mimic a beak, and no additional alterations suggest it as part of the owl's face. The spout remains fixed to the side of the owl's body without assuming a mechanical or beak-like structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a gracefully curved tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the handle retains its original form without transformation. It does not exhibit modifications to resemble a tail and remains attached to the teapot body as a handle, preserving its utility as part of a teapot rather than an owl's tail. The curvature and ornate design remain, reflecting the teapot design rather than mimicking an owl's tail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two glowing eyes made of cogs visible on the owl's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's face displays two prominent, glowing eyes. However, they do not appear to be made of cogs. Instead, they are strikingly vivid and resemble the natural eyes of an owl without any visible mechanical components such as cogs. The glowing eyes contribute to the owl's lifelike appearance.",

      "question": "Is the owl positioned on a richly carved wooden branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the owl positioned against a background featuring a wooden branch beneath the owl. The branch is visually detailed in texture and richness, enhancing the scene and grounding the owl image within a natural context. The perceived texture and detailing emphasize the owl's perch on this branch.",
