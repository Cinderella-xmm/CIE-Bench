    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the horse and elephant depicted as chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse and elephant have exaggerated proportions with a cartoonish appearance, akin to chibi-style, which involves stylization with large heads and small limbs. This can be inferred from the rounded shapes and simplified features compared to a realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the horse still standing on the elephant's back in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is visually positioned in a way that suggests balance on the elephant's back, as seen by its placement and posture that mimics that of Image A, where the horse was initially standing on the elephant.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background feature a photorealistic grassy field and sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though Image B maintains a similar setting to Image A, the background—composed of the grassy field and sky—looks less realistic than Image A. Collective evidence like the texture and lighting indicate a stylized, simulated environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scene displayed within an ornate photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is surrounded by an elaborate frame with decorative patterns, which suggests it is displayed within a frame, contrasting Image A which lacks such a border.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse and elephant rendered as 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse and elephant have smooth surfaces, lighting effects, and consistent three-dimensional shading, which are indicative of 3D modeling techniques. This resembles the characteristics of a 3D rendered scene more than a realistic photo.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
