        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a wall clock is visible above the doors, suggesting that this area likely continues to feature a wall clock. World knowledge tells us many hallways or corridors have clocks for functionality, just like home interiors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a setting of a hallway with doors and a stone wall characteristic of a castle-like atmosphere, rather than an indoor living space with furniture like cabinets. There are no signs of a wooden cabinet in the visual cues of the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows stone walls, an arch window, and a heavy wooden door, all elements commonly associated with castle or historical architecture. The presence of these elements implies a setting typical of a castle hall.",

      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image match the lighting style from the original image, with similar shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the lighting creates distinct shadows on the floor and walls, similar to the style in Image A where sunlight casts shadows and light patches. This suggests that both images maintain a consistent lighting theme with sunlight streaming from one side, creating dramatic light contrasts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes a small potted plant on the floor, but no sign of the vases. This indicates a change in elements, with only the plant being a kind of continuity with the original image's indoor decoration style.",
