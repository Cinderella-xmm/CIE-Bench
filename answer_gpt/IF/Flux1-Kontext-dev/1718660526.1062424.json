    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the animal composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles arranged to form its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal clearly shows a pattern consistent with small tiles which are typically ceramic. The arrangement of these tiles creates the body structure, suggesting a mosaic design. This involves understanding how mosaics are constructed, using small pieces to form an image or pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate that the stripes have a glossy finish, characteristic of ceramic tiles. The colors are distinctly vibrant orange and deep black, which aligns with the shiny, reflective nature of ceramics, often chosen for their color vibrancy and smooth finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes and snout formed from precisely cut ceramic tiles that maintain their expressive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the eyes and snout as structured with tile pieces that maintain an expressive form, despite being composed of geometric shapes. This indicates precision in design to preserve expression, a method observed in handmade or artistically crafted tiles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mosaic animal positioned on a surface with a visible sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the animal on a surface that visually resembles sand, characterized by a granular texture that is commonly associated with beaches or deserts. This texture contrasts with the smooth appearance of the ceramic tiles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the smooth, glossy surface of the tiles and the rough, granular texture of the platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic tiles present a smooth and glossy appearance, which starkly contrasts with the granular texture of the sandy platform. This contrast is evident in juxtaposing materials typically seen in artistic installations to emphasize different textures.",
