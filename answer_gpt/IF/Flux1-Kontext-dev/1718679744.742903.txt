    "Question": "Q1: Is the crocodile depicted with flat, solid color regions and exaggerated features characteristic of pop art?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is depicted with bold, flat regions of color resembling the characteristics of pop art. The exaggerated colors and stylization of features like the hat and sunglasses fit well within pop art's traits, which often employ vibrant and flat color application. This can be observed by comparing the patterns and color applications used, which are indicative of pop art's graphic and lively aesthetic.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the edges of the crocodile, hat, and sunglasses defined by bold, continuous black outlines?",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the hat and sunglasses rendered in highly saturated, vivid neon colors (e.g., electric pink, lime green, hot orange)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and sunglasses feature very bright and vivid colors such as electric pink and other neon hues, which stand out strongly and align with the use of neon colors commonly found in pop art. This can be seen by the presence of these near-fluorescent colors in the depiction of clothing and accessories on the crocodile.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Have the crocodileâ€™s scales been replaced with a consistent, repeating geometric pattern (e.g., squares, rectangles, or dots)?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the crocodile with a repeating geometric pattern on its body, showing a consistent grid of shapes replacing natural scale textures. This aligns with a stylized approach often employed in pop art where natural textures are replaced with abstract patterns for artistic effect.",
