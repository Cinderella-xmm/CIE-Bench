      "question": "Has the chocolate donut been replaced with colorful macarons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows a plate of colorful macarons arranged in a circular pattern. The absence of any chocolate donut suggests that the previous food item has been replaced by these macarons. Given the visual cues and context, it's evident the replacement has occurred.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original plate still present and is the arrangement of items on the plate unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a white plate on which macarons are placed. The general arrangement appears consistent, as the macarons are orderly arranged in a circular formation, similar to how items might be presented on a plate. Without needing to inspect Image A, it can be inferred the plate type remains unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the background been changed to a light gray tablecloth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a light gray tablecloth as the background beneath the white plate. This suggests a change in the setting to a more neutral and possibly formal context, relying on visual cue interpretation and typical presentation settings.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays good lighting that accentuates the colors of the macarons, a clear focus on the subject (macarons on the plate), and a balanced composition centered around the plate. These are typical hallmarks of food photography aimed at making the food appear appealing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The macarons on the plate are presented in a variety of colors, which add visual interest and consistency with the theme of a pasty or dessert setting. This variety complements the light gray tablecloth and the white plate, making them suitable for the scene.",
