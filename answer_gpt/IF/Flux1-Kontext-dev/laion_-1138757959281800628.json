    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire hotel and pool scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene of the hotel and pool is surrounded by transparent walls that resemble a glass casing, suggesting that it is enclosed within a glass terrarium structure. This is based on the visible reflections and refractions that are characteristic of glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the pool display layered water effects, such as visible depth layers or textured surface ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool water appears smooth and lacks detailed textures indicating depth or complex surface ripples. It presents a uniform surface that does not display distinct, layered water effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sunbathers and surrounding trees visibly miniaturized in size relative to the building and pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunbathers and trees appear in proportion to the scale of the hotel and pool, suggesting a crafted miniaturized effect. They seem smaller compared to the structure, which implies a scaled-down scene often found in models or dioramas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there fabricated cascading greenery visibly growing from the rooftop of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has visible cascading greenery flowing down from the top. These green elements appear fabricated as they uniformly cover the sections of the building, differing from natural growth patterns, which indicates an artificial addition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are small, whimsical beach accessories (e.g., toy floats, tiny buckets, or miniature umbrellas) placed near the edge of the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although there are visible elements that resemble poolside amenities (like chaise lounges and umbrellas), there is no clear evidence of specifically whimsical or miniature beach accessories like toy floats or tiny buckets around the pool's edge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there floating 3D cloud elements positioned above the scene, distinct from the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cloud-like objects that are positioned directly above the scene and appear to be distinct, physical elements rather than part of a distant sky. These clouds have a 3D appearance, indicative of fabricated elements within the enclosed diorama.",
