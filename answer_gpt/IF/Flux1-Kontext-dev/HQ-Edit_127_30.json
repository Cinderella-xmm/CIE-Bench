      "question": "Has the violin been transformed into a closed, sleek case-like structure suitable for luxury branding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is displayed inside an open case with a luxurious look, indicative of careful presentation rather than transformation into a case itself. The violin remains a recognizable musical instrument, and it is the surrounding case and presentation that provide the luxury branding aspect. Therefore, the transformation into a case-like structure is not observed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the interior of the violinâ€™s body lined with a visible red or dark velvet material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material that is visible lining or nearby the violin is actually the interior lining of the open case, which is red velvet-like material. The violin's body itself is not shown to have this material inside it; hence, the visible velvet is associated with the case, not the violin's interior.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chinrest and tailpiece of the instrument adorned with gold-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chinrest and tailpiece of the violin maintain their typical black color and do not have any gold-colored accents. The gold accents are instead found on the locks and hinges of the case housing the violin, contributing to the luxurious presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible, elegant scripted font displayed along the strings of the instrument?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an elegant scripted font is indeed visible but not along the strings of the violin. Instead, it appears on the interior lining of the case's lid, indicating perhaps branding details of the violin or its series. The font's placement enhances the luxurious appeal of the displayed setup.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is placed inside a wooden case that sits on a sturdy wooden pedestal stand. The stand has a classic design without ornate carvings. This setup replaces the previous red upholstered ottoman seen in Image A, signifying a shift to a structured and classic wooden presentation.",
