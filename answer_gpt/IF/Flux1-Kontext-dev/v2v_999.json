      "question": "Have the cabinet and sink been converted into five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabinet and sink are still visibly present and unchanged, and they have not been converted into nesting dolls. Instead, five nesting dolls have been added to the bathtub area, and these items remain functional and unchanged. Thus, the conclusion that the cabinets and sink have been turned into dolls does not align with the visual evidence in the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from biggest to smallest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the five nesting dolls are positioned along the edge of the bathtub. They are arranged progressively from the left to the right, with the largest doll at the left-most position, decreasing in size to the smallest doll on the far right. This arrangement aligns with the typical order from largest to smallest.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the nesting dolls are visibly placed on top of the bathtub's outer rim, positioned along the edge and arranged in a linear fashion. This is clear from their placement in relation to the bathtub, confirming that they are indeed along the edge.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the aspect ratio of the edited image maintained at 3:2 horizontally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, one can evaluate the width and height of Image B. Visually comparing between the width and height appears consistent with a common 3:2 aspect ratio, which is typical for many photographs. Since the overall composition of the area depicted in Image B matches Image A, this also supports the idea that the aspect ratio is unchanged and remains standard.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a chibi-style design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style is often characterized by exaggerated features such as large heads and simplified facial details. In Image B, the nesting dolls on the bathtub have distinctively large, round heads and simplified, charming facial expressions that fit within the realm of chibi-style as seen in popular culture.",
