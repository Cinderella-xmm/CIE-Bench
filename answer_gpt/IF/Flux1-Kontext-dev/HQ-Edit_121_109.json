      "question": "Has the hummingbird been transformed into a non-biological, ethereal entity resembling a garden spirit rather than a realistic bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird has undergone significant changes, incorporating vibrant colors and features that are not typically found in realistic animals. The wings exhibit a fantastical array of iridescent colors, resembling a spectrum, which is often associated with non-biological, dreamlike entities. This ethereal aura, combined with an overall abstract and artistic presentation of the bird, suggests a transformation into a more spiritual or mythical garden entity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings of the hummingbird appear as iridescent, glass-like structures that display a full rainbow spectrum of shimmering colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings of the hummingbird in Image B have distinct characteristics that are not merely natural. They display a spectrum of shimmering colors across the entire wing span, suggesting an iridescent, glass-like appearance. The vibrant colors evoke a quality similar to that of light passing through a prism or a stained glass effect, common elements in artistic depictions of ethereal or magical beings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the body feathers of the hummingbird replaced with glowing, petal-like structures that emit light or have a luminous appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the hummingbird does not exhibit traditional feathers. Instead, it gives off an appearance suggesting glowing, petal-like structures or luminous elements, consistent with the fantastical theme present in the image. This observation aligns with the intention to portray the bird as a reflective, radiant entity, enhancing its garden spirit-like aura.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the beak been replaced with a transparent, crystalline spout from which a golden or honey-colored liquid (floral nectar) is visibly flowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beak of the hummingbird has not been replaced with a crystalline spout. Although there are changes in the wings and tail feathers, the beak remains consistent with a traditional hummingbird's beak, visibly pointing toward the feeder with no liquid flowing from it. The presence of a visible, structured beak indicates that this part maintains its avian form, contrary to the transition of other parts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the tail of the hummingbird consist of green, leafy vines with small blossoms growing along them, blending into the surrounding garden?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the tail of the hummingbird indeed resembles green, leafy vines, in contrast to typical bird tails, which are feathered. These vine-like extensions blend naturally with the surrounding garden scenery, making the creature appear more integrated with its environment, as if it is borrowing elements directly from the flora around it.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the transformed hummingbird visually integrated into the garden environment, with colors, textures, and elements (like vines and petals) harmonizing with the surrounding flora?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation of the hummingbird in Image B presents it with elements that visually integrate it into the garden setting. The colors, textures, and incorporation of vine and petal-like structures create a seamless transition between the bird and its surrounding flora, making the creature appear as an extension of the garden itself. This integration is enhanced by the coherent color palette and the organic shapes shared by both the environment and the bird.",
