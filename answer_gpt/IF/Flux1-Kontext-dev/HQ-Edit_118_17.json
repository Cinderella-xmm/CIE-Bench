      "question": "Is the stave church enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible structural framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stave church appears to be inside a transparent glass display case, evident by the clear glass edges and reflections visible. The display case has structural framing visible at the edges, indicating it is indeed a glass container. This representation suggests showcasing or preservation of the church in a contained environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple layers of soft, wispy clouds visible in the background panel behind the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B behind the display case does not feature clouds. The scene shows mountains with a clear sky, and no visual cues indicate the presence of clouds. The representation only includes the landforms behind the glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are small-scale coniferous trees positioned around the base of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, coniferous trees are visible in the scene, but they are part of the landscape contained within the glass display case, rather than positioned around its base. The design suggests a miniature model within the case that includes these trees as landscape components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountains in the background feature a desaturated, low-contrast color palette consistent with a muted tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mountains visible in Image B show a desaturated and muted color palette, evidenced by the soft tones and lack of vivid contrast which gives a subdued and gentle appearance similar to that of a painted background, fitting the context of a model environment within the display case.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there sculpted rocky terrain forming a border around the base of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass display case in Image B features rocky elements that appear sculpted to form a border at its bottom part. These rocks serve as the decorative element grounding the miniature landscape within the display, matching typical presentations in models to depict natural terrain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a simulated snowy path with faint footprint imprints leading up to the entrance of the stave church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a path visible leading up to the stave church, which has a lightly snow-covered appearance. However, there are no discernible footprint imprints on this snowy path. It suggests a pristine, untouched snow surface rather than one marked by footprints.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the stave church retain its original architectural details such as carved wooden elements, multiple gables, and dragon-shaped roof ornaments?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts the stave church with its distinctive architectural details intact, including carved wooden designs, multiple gables, and dragon-shaped roof ornaments. These elements characterize stave churches and are faithfully reproduced in the model inside the display case, retaining the original design features.",
