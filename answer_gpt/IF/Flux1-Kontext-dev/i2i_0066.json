      "question": "Has the vase and bouquet been transformed into a 3D printed display model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase and bouquet appear as a single uniform beige color and exhibit a texture consistent with 3D printing. The flowers and vase are all the same color, which differs from natural flowers and suggests a manufactured object. These cues indicate that the vase and bouquet have been transformed into a 3D printed display model.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D printed model appear to be made of matte material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D printed display model in Image B shows a lack of reflections and a consistent texture without any glossy areas. These characteristics suggest that the material used is matte, as shiny or glossy materials would produce specular highlights, which are absent here.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a display plaque added at the base of the 3D printed model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the 3D printed model in Image B, there is a rectangular block with raised letters, giving the impression of a display plaque or a label for exhibiting purposes. This additional component appears to distinguish it as an exhibit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes large blue signage and people standing in what appears to be an environment suitable for presentations and demonstrations. Also, the presence of displays and stand-like structures aligns with typical setups of tech expo booths.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the 3D printed model maintain the design of the original vase and bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A with Image B, the general shape and design elements, such as the arrangement of the bouquet and the form of the vase, seem consistent. Despite being transformed into a single-tone 3D printed model, the design reflects the original items' structure and layout.",
