        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango slices appear as cubes, neatly arranged similar to Image A. They maintain the characteristics of a real mango, focusing on shape and texture similar to how a mango is naturally cut. The arrangement does not imply any figurative transformation or whimsical design. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues showing the cubes retaining a consistent and natural appearance, typical of a freshly cut mango.",

      "question": "Have the cut mango pieces been slightly increased in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the mango cubes are prominently visible and appear large relative to the surrounding objects, like the lime and bowl. When comparing to Image A, the mango pieces in Image B are slightly larger, reflected by the scale of the cubes relative to other objects, inferring a modification in their dimensions through visual proportion analysis.",

      "question": "Do the mango pieces have a shiny 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango cubes exhibit smooth surfaces with heightened dimensionality, providing a shiny and three-dimensional appearance. This effect is achieved through lighting and shadow play combined with the texture of the cubes, which suggests an intentional enhancement to give them a glossy and realistic depth, unlike the flatter appearance in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the lime and chili powder bowl have a cartoon-like design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a lime and chili powder bowl that are clean and exhibit simplicity in form. The lime is perfectly symmetrical and the bowl has smooth edges, which aligns with features seen in cartoon-like depictions emphasizing clarity and minimal detail. The visual simplicity and precision without intricate detailing gives them an animated or cartoon-like resemblance. Contrasting them with Image A shows subtle complexity in texture, reinforcing the cartoon-like interpretations in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a contained space around the plate with walls on the sides and top, resembling a shelf or compartment. The plate sits within this boxed area which can be interpreted as a shelf environment due to its enclosing structure. This setup is different from Image A where there is an open background, confirming the presence of a shelf-like context in Image B through spatial arrangement analysis.",
