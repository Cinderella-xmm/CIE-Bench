        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stickers appear to have irregular outlines to them due to the white borders forming around the character, rather than being confined within a perfect square. This indicates that they don't maintain a perfect 1:1 aspect ratio.",
