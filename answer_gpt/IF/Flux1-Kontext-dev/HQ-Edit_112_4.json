      "question": "Is the Blue Jay rendered as a miniature sculpture made of a solid material such as ceramic or metal, rather than a live bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Blue Jay appears to be a sculpture due to its placement within the glass dome, which is a common way of displaying delicate or artistic objects. Its form seems artificially perfect, lacking the small variations typically seen in live animals, such as slight movements or imperfections. The surface of the bird and the setting suggests a crafted, solid texture as opposed to a natural, living one.",
