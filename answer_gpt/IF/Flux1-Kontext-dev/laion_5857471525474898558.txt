    "Question": "Q1: Is the building's facade composed of visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building's facade consists of blocks that visually resemble the aesthetic of LEGO bricks. These blocks have the characteristic appearance of LEGO pieces with interlocking edges and a uniform size. Although they are styled to mimic LEGO's unique design, the facade maintains a real-world architectural look with details common to LEGO models. Therefore, the choice 'Yes' reflects the presence of LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the building’s bricks rendered in muted red tones and the window frames in muted blue tones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bricks are clearly displayed in a muted red tone, consistent with the look of typical LEGO brick colors. The window frames, however, are in a muted tone but do not exhibit a strong blue tint—they are more neutral or gray in appearance. This absence of blue tones suggests a deviation from the description given. The balance between muted red and the expected muted blue is not wholly achieved, indicating 'No' as the correct choice.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Have the climbing plants been replaced with green, segmented LEGO-style vines?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the plants designed in a form that resembles LEGO-style construction. These vines possess chunky, segmented characteristics typical of LEGO pieces. Their blocky appearance and simple green coloration closely mimic the style expected of LEGO components used for flora representation. Thus, the plants do appear as green, segmented LEGO-style vines, supporting the answer 'Yes.'",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do all balconies feature gray, blocky LEGO-style railings instead of realistic metal or decorative designs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the balconies have a gray, structured form that adheres to LEGO aesthetic principles. They lack ornamental or metal-like features, appearing instead as simplified, blocky constructs typical in LEGO creations. Visual cues in Image B confirm that all balcony railings opt for the LEGO-style instead of naturalistic designs. Therefore, 'Yes' accurately describes the situation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform that contrasts with the surrounding environment to highlight its blocky aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the building affixed to a noticeably plain platform without complex surroundings, accentuating the building's block-like nature and LEGO-inspired design. This foundation contrasts sharply with realistic environments and underscores the LEGO aesthetic with its simplicity and coherence, confirming the choice of 'Yes.'",
    "answer": "Yes"
