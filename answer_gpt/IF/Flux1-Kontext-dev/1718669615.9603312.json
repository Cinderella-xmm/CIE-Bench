      "question": "Is the spaceship visually transformed into a style resembling a Greek amphora painting, with flat, stylized forms and decorative borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spaceship features a design with flat, stylized elements typical of Greek amphora paintings, which often include geometric patterns and a decorative approach. The spaceship exhibits a painterly effect, with simplified shapes and outlines, and the presence of striped lines around its structure, which resembles the borders found in amphora illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible stylized circular motifs incorporated into the design of the spaceship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a spaceship with stylized elements referencing Greek design. Circular motifs are visible, integrated into its design, which could reflect the traditional use of circular decorations found in Greek art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spaceship include intricate meander patterns as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the spaceship does not appear to contain intricate meander patterns that are typical in Greek art. Instead, the design maintains a simpler stylized decoration without the characteristic repeated meander pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the landscape below been transformed into elongated abstract waveforms rather than realistic terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape has undergone significant stylization, distorting the terrain into elongated abstract waveforms that move away from realistic representation and align with artistic interpretations found in patterned designs of ancient artworks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the color palette of the landscape composed primarily of muted earth tones consistent with ancient pottery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape in Image B has a color palette dominated by muted earth tones, such as browns and ochres, which are consistent with colors typically seen in ancient pottery, reflecting natural and earthy hues characteristic of historical artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylistic changes in Image B, including the transformation into a painterly style and abstract representations, the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape appears consistent with that of Image A, maintaining the perspective and placement alignment.",
