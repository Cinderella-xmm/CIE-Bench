    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image show the building transformed into a giant mechanical golem with visible articulated limbs and exposed gears?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been transformed into a giant robot or golem with clearly defined mechanical limbs, including arms, legs, and even a torso that resembles machinery. These features are evident in the visible articulated limbs and suggest elements like exposed gears typical of mechanical constructs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are all original windows replaced with glowing energy panels that emit light?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows of what was initially a building in Image A have been altered to resemble glowing panels, providing an illuminated effect. This transformation gives the appearance of energy panels instead of traditional windows.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the balconies been transformed into arm-like mechanical appendages extending from the building?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the building is transformed into a mechanical golem with arms that extend from what was originally the building’s structure. However, specific balcony structures turning into these arms are not discernible, as the arms appear as integral parts of the mechanical design rather than modifications of balconies.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there visible intricate circuit patterns covering the surface of the building, resembling electronic wiring or circuits?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the surface of the robot or golem does not show any distinct circuit patterns akin to electronic wiring. The surface primarily resembles armor plating or mechanical components without further intricate circuit designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the building's angular edges appear as dynamic or movable mechanical components, such as hinges, pistons, or rotating joints?",
    "explanation": "The edited image depicts the building as a robotic figure, suggesting that its once-architectural edges are now part of a dynamic mechanical construct with movable components. These visibly include articulated joints and other parts that imply mechanical movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the background still a clear blue sky without any changes or additions?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the sky is a clear blue without obstructions. Image B, however, shows a background with a darker tone, potentially indicating a different time of day, such as dusk, or atmospheric changes, thus not maintaining the original clear blue sky.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Has the building’s overall size and position within the frame remained consistent with the original image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image represents a transformation from a stationary building (as shown in Image A) to a colossal mechanical robot occupying a different position within the frame. This change implies the overall size and frame position have also shifted.",
    "answer": "No"
