      "question": "Has the backpack's fabric been replaced with a visible rugged leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack exhibits a soft leather texture with a matte finish, which is commonly associated with rugged leather. This is in contrast to the canvas-like texture seen in Image A. The rich brown color and visible grain suggest a leather material. Therefore, combining visual cues with world knowledge, the backpack's fabric appears to be leather in Image B.",

      "question": "Have the buckles been updated to feature an antique brass finish instead of the original metallic silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buckles are gold-toned, which visually resembles an antique brass finish, especially when compared to the metallic silver buckles in Image A. The choice of color and finish can suggest a vintage or antique aesthetic, typical of brass. Therefore, the buckles in Image B appear to have an antique brass finish.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible vintage-style travel patches attached along the side panels of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of travel patches on the side panels or elsewhere; rather, there are embossed graphics on the main body. Image A shows plain panels without patches. Therefore, combining visual cues with the understanding of vintage-style patches' placement, we conclude there are no vintage-style travel patches visible.",

      "question": "Is the text \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" clearly visible and overlaid on the front flap of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bold text reads 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' directly on the front flap of the backpack. This text is not present in Image A, which shows a different logo on the front pocket. Thus, based on visual evidence and understanding of text placement, the phrase 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' is clearly visible on Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a subtle sketch-style compass graphic embossed near the bottom of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a detailed and prominent compass design embossed near the bottom right of the backpack. This contrasts with Image A, which doesn't show such a graphic. The level of detail and placement as a decorative element on Image B indicates a deliberate inclusion of a vintage-style compass design.",
