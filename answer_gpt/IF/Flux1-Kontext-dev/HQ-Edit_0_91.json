    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the features are illustrated with bold and clean lines, and the patterns on the robe are more graphic and abstract compared to a realistic portrayal. This suggests a move towards a semi-cartoon style as stylization often involves this kind of abstraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textile patterns on the robe enhanced with visible gold leaf accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the robe are created using vibrant colors and clear outlines, typical of graphic illustrations. They do not have the reflective quality or texture associated with real gold leaf. The depiction relies on bold colors rather than metallic effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the hands visibly enlarged compared to their original size in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are drawn in a more stylized, cartoonish manner which can sometimes make them appear slightly larger due to the bold lines and simplified shapes. Comparing with Image A, the hands do seem slightly exaggerated, fitting into the aesthetic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image have a deep indigo border framing the entire composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a prominent border that seems to follow an ornamental style with a deep indigo hue. This border element frames the figure and matches the typical coloring used in graphic and stylized artworks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines extending from the robe into the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the robe are brightly colored and well-contained within the garment's boundaries. They do not extend into the frame, maintaining a graphic style where the figures and patterns remain within their designed space.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
