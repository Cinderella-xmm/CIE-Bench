      "question": "Have the couple's backs been designed as a crystal silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple's backs exhibit a distinct texture and surface that resembles tiny facets, indicative of a crystal formation. The pattern and appearance of these surfaces suggest a crystal-like quality that was not present in typical clothing or skin textures. This visual transformation indicates that the couple's backs have been edited to resemble crystal silhouettes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the design maintain the integrity of the couple's original back shape as silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the couple is depicted from behind, sitting on a bench, maintaining a particular human form. In Image B, despite the texture and material changes to a crystal-like appearance, the overall shape and posture of the couple remain intact. Thus, the silhouette, or the outline, of the couple is preserved in the transformation, reflecting the original shape.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the couple’s back silhouettes show transparency and reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited areas on the couple in Image B appear to have a transparent and reflective nature. This is suggested by the light interaction with their surfaces, showing bright highlights and subtle depth within the crystal texture, characteristics typical of transparent, crystalline materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surrounding environment (bench, tree, grass) unchanged except for the edited couple’s backs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the environment, including the bench, tree, and grass, appears consistent across both images. The edits focus solely on the couple, specifically their backs, not altering any other aspect of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the overall design, featuring the crystal silhouettes of the couple, align with the aesthetic suitable for Valentine's Day gifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Valentine's Day gifts typically emphasize themes of love, romance, and beauty. The edited image's transformation of the couple into crystal-like figures evokes a sense of elegance and timelessness, qualities often associated with romantic gestures. The soft lighting and serene setting further enhance the scene's romantic and affectionate tone, making it aesthetically suitable for a Valentine's Day theme.",
