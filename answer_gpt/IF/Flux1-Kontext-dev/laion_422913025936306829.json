      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited shirt design use vibrant, saturated colors typical of pop art rather than subdued or earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design prominently features vibrant colors such as electric blue, yellow, and hot pink, which stand out distinctly against the background. This use of bright and saturated colors is characteristic of pop art, aiming to capture attention and evoke a lively feel. Without referring to Image A yet, the visual information from Image B aligns with the typical aesthetics of pop art, moving away from earthy tones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are large, solid-colored sections used to define the muscular figure’s anatomy, such as chest, arms, and legs, replacing fine shading or gradient effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the muscular figure with solid blocks of color to define its anatomy, using bold colors like blue and orange. This style choice eliminates any subtle shading or gradient effects in favor of bright, uniform color sections, creating a distinct and graphic look. The design intention appears to emphasize the contrast and simplicity over detailed shading.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the edges of the figure and surrounding elements consist of crisp, angular, or straight lines rather than flowing or organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines outlining the figure and the surrounding design elements are bold and crisp, creating clear demarcation between shapes. This approach uses angular or straight lines as opposed to more fluid, organic curves, which supports a precise and graphic aesthetic typical in designs aimed at being bold and striking.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the previously subtle or gold-toned patterns now rendered in bright, glowing neon colors such as electric blue, hot pink, or lime green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the patterns, which may have been more subdued or in a metallic tone in Image A, are now highlighted in vivid, neon-like colors such as electric blue and intense orange with a background of hot pink. These changes aim for high visibility and energy, common in neon-inspired designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there recurring, stylized patterns (such as stars, waves, or dots) repeated across the shirt in a consistent and energetic manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases recurring patterns like stars and various geometric shapes across the design. These elements are integrated consistently throughout the shirt, adding a rhythmic and energetic feel. This repetition helps unify the design, aligning with principles seen in dynamic and stylized art styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the central figure still clearly identifiable as a muscular male figure in a dynamic pose, with arms raised and body angled, even after the stylistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the shift in stylistic approach, the central figure remains identifiable as a muscular male in a dynamic pose. The solid colors and bold lines continue to depict the raised arm and angled body, maintaining the original pose’s essence and ensuring the figure's recognition.",
