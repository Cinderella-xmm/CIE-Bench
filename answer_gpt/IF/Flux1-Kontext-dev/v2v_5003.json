      "question": "Is the bow depicted as a folded origami paper design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow retains a smooth, natural texture typical of a wooden bow rather than the angular and creased structure of origami. Origami designs usually display distinct folds and creases, which are absent here. The bow displays curvature and a grip that mimic realistic bow designs found in archery equipment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arrows in the quiver depicted as folded origami paper designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrows in Image B possess smooth, linear shapes that suggest they are made of wood, typical of functional arrows. An origami design would exhibit more angularity and visible paper folds, which are not present in this image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the woodland backdrop retain its natural appearance without any artificial alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B shows a forest scene with elements like moss, leaves, and tree trunks, appearing realistic and in line with a natural setting, fitting the typical characteristics of a natural woodland environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and positioning of the bow and quiver remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the bow and quiver composition appear consistent. Both images show the quiver on the left with arrows and the bow rests to the right side, with similar angles and proximity. The position of both items relative to each other and the background remains unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bow and quiver show clear paper folds and lack realistic material textures such as wood or leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow and quiver display textures that mimic wood and leather rather than paper origami. The bow exhibits a wood grain and curvature typical in real bows, and the quiver has a smooth surface characteristic of leather. There are no discernible folds typical of paper origami.",
