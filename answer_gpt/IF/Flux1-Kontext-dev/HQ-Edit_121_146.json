      "question": "Is the central body of the object now a transparent glass chamber suitable for holding a candle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the object is not a transparent glass chamber. Instead, it features a highly ornamental design with intricate gold floral motifs and a solid background. Common sense knowledge of objects that hold candles would typically visualize a clear chamber to allow light to shine through, which is not present here.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no glass chamber; rather, the central body of the object has a rich red hue, adorned with gold detailing. While the object is richly colored, the absence of a glass chamber warrants a 'no' answer.",
