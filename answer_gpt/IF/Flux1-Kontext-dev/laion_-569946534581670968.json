      "question": "Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chicken wings do resemble plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric based on their appearance. The texture is softer and more uniform compared to realistic fried chicken wings, indicating a fabric-like quality. From Image A, the chicken wings have realistic features like varied textures and coloration typical of fried chicken. Thus, in Image B, the wings appear to be crafted from fabric rather than actual food.",

      "question": "Is the sauce replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sauce bowl appears to contain a large, fluffy object resembling a pillow or plush toy rather than a liquid or semi-liquid sauce. The bright orange color is consistent with the original sauce color from Image A, but the texture and appearance strongly suggest a pillow-like object in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene set on a smooth, light-colored wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B appears light-colored and smooth, suggesting a wooden or similar material background. Image A has a darker, textured surface which does not resemble a light-colored wooden surface. Therefore, the setting in Image B matches the description of a smooth, light-colored wooden surface.",

      "question": "Are the plush wings and the orange pillow arranged in the same spatial configuration as the original chicken wings and sauce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spatial arrangement of objects in Image B, including the plush wings and pillow imitates the configuration seen in Image A with chicken wings and sauce. The wings are similarly positioned, and the pillow sits in the same location as the sauce cup in Image A, indicating a matching arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the plush wings and pillow clearly appear as fabric-based toys rather than real food items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings and pillow have an appearance that suggests fabric material, showing uniform textures and contours unlike the irregularities seen in real food items. Image A presents realistic food items with their characteristic details such as varying textures, colors, and assumed weight indicative of real food. Therefore, Image B's items clearly resemble fabric-based toys.",
