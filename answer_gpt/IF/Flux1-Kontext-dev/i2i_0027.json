      "question": "Has the dog been converted into a chibi-style blind box figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog appears very stylized with exaggerated features such as an enlarged head and large eyes, which are characteristic of chibi-style designs. Chibi figures often resemble cartoon-like versions of real-life figures or characters, typically depicted as cute and overly simplified. The enlarged head, large eyes, and small body are common traits of chibi designs, indicating that the dog has been converted into a chibi-style blind box figure.",

      "question": "Is the dogâ€™s body still in the prone, ball-focused pose after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog now appears to be sitting or positioned on a base, rather than lying down or in a prone position. The dog is also not in a position to be fixated on the ball as it was in the original image. In Image A, the dog was near the floor with a forward body posture, indicating focus on the ball. The edited image portrays a different stance, thus the dog's body posture has changed.",

      "question": "Has the dog's head been enlarged slightly compared to its original size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog showcases a much larger head in proportion to the body, which is typically seen in chibi-style or cartoon figures. Image A depicts a normal-sized dog with a head proportional to its body. The visual cues in Image B confirm that the head is enlarged, emphasizing the chibi styling.",

      "question": "Is the tennis ball placed so that it touches the dog's nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is touching or near the dog's paws, implying close proximity, but it is not directly touching the dog's nose. In Image A, the ball was directly in front of the dog but likely not touching its nose. The positioning relative to the nose in Image B suggests that it is not in direct contact with the nose itself.",

      "question": "Does the base feature a relief tennis ball pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the dog is positioned on a simple green base that appears smooth and not textured with any discernible patterns or designs, including any relief pattern of a tennis ball. In comparison to common bases, which may sometimes feature patterns, this base does not display any such characteristic.",
