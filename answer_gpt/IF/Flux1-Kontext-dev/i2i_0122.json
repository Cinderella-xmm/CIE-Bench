        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses of liquid are placed on a small round table with a snowy surface, typical of an outdoor café table in a winter setting. This contrasts with Image A, where the drinks are placed on a wooden indoor table. The presence of snow and the type of table indicate a change from an indoor desk to an outdoor café table.",

      "question": "Is there a snowy cabin visible in the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background contains a structure that resembles a cabin, with snow visible on its roof and surrounding area. This is different from Image A, where the background is indoors and does not depict any such structure. Based on the snow and cabin-like structure in Image B, it can be inferred that there is a snowy cabin visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image display elements contributing to a warm winter atmosphere, such as warm lighting or steam from the drinks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows steam rising from the drinks, indicating warmth, and the lighting suggests a warm ambiance typical of winter settings. This is consistent with creating a warm winter atmosphere, which is not present in Image A, where the setting is indoors. The combination of steam and the outdoor winter setting in Image B enhances the warm winter atmosphere.",

      "question": "Is the outdoor café table correctly positioned in front of the snowy cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outdoor café table is placed in a scene with a snowy background, and it visually aligns with the snowy cabin seen in the distance. This logical arrangement suggests the table is correctly placed in the outdoor setting as one might expect in a café scene. Image A does not have a comparable setting as it is indoors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image A features an indoor setting with wooden material and partial window view, while Image B entirely replaces this with an outdoor snowy cabin scene. Based on the visual differences and change of setting, there are no discernible elements from the original indoor background in the edited outdoor image.",
