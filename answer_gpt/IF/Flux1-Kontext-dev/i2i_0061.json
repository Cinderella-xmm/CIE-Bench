      "question": "Does the entire photo exhibit a bright and soft watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall color palette appears much brighter and softer compared to typical photographic styles. The clouds, ground, and other elements are depicted in a way that emulates the gentle tones of watercolor art, creating a soft and diffuse appearance across the entire image. This is characteristic of a watercolor style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ground depicted using semi-abstract brushstrokes with slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground is shown with generalized shapes and blended colors rather than distinct and detailed photographic features. The brushstrokes appear to be smooth and continuous, giving a blurred and abstract look to the ground, similar to what one would expect in an artistic rendering rather than a sharp photograph.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background buildings rendered with semi-abstract brushstrokes and slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background buildings have lost much of their photographic detail and instead are represented with simplified shapes and blurred colors. This approach resembles semi-abstract brushstrokes, where precision is less emphasized, and an abstract or impressionistic effect is achieved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a consistently bright and soft aesthetic throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a bright and evenly illuminated appearance throughout its composition. The soft aesthetics can be seen in the gentle tones and lack of shadows, typical in watercolor and similar art styles, maintaining a uniform softness from the sky to the ground and the skateboard ramp.",

      "question": "Has the character’s position and posture been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character’s position and posture in Image B are identical to those in Image A. The character is depicted in the same stance on the skateboard ramp, with the same arm and leg positioning, indicating that the character's physical layout hasn't changed between the original and edited versions.",
