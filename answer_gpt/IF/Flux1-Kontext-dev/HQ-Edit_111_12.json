      "question": "Are the knitting needles visibly larger than their original size in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles, although depicted in a cartoon style, maintain a size proportionate to the hand and the knitting project. Comparing to Image A, where the needles are of realistic size, there is no indication that they have been visibly enlarged. The cartoon style could make them appear slightly different due to simplified designs, but they are not notably larger.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cup on the side table have visible swirling lines above it representing steam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear illustrations of swirling lines above the cup, typical of cartoon representations to indicate steam or heat. This is an artistic element often used to visually suggest warmth in a simplified manner. The presence of these lines clearly indicates steam.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fabric draped over the woman's lap been transformed to show a visible yarn or knitted pattern texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric draped over the woman's lap retains a simple pattern associable with knitting but lacks detailed texture typical of real knitting such as seen in Image A. Instead, the visual is more about color and line design due to the cartoon style. It doesn't show the intricate yarn texture that Image A depicts.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rectangular writing panel present in the image that has a border made to look like knitted yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no observable rectangular writing panel with a border intended to look like knitted yarn. The presence of an open book on the lap is clear, yet the book's border is not styled as knitted yarn; it's depicted plainly as part of the cartoon aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the writing panel located inside the pages of an open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an open book placed on the lap. The book's pages serve as a writing panel. Visual cues imply something being read or written as it is common in scenes with books. This directly fulfills the condition of a writing panel location.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a soft, glowing lamplight visible in the image, contributing to a warm ambient glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a lamp visible in the background, characterized with simplified lines and colors typical of cartoon illustration. However, while it suggests lighting, it doesn't portray the same sensory warmth as Image A, where glowing light effects are more detailed. The comic style doesn't emphasize luminosity in the same manner.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the overall image style been changed to a cartoon style with exaggerated features and simplified textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reflects a distinct cartoon style, with exaggerated facial and hand features and the use of clear lines and flat colors instead of detailed textures. This distinguishes it from Image A's photographic realism, showcasing usual traits of cartoonization.",
