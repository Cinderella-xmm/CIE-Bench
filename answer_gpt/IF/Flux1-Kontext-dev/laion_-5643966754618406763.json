    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stack of tires reshaped into a creature resembling an armadillo with a segmented, armored back made from the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of tires does not resemble an armadillo nor does it have a segmented, armored back typical of such a creature. The tires are stacked with one upright and the others in a pyramid formation, lacking any features that would visually constitute an armadillo-like shape or structure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic joints located within the openings between the tires, suggesting mechanical articulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any visible metallic joints between the tires. The tires have been modified with energy-like structures that look like they are emanating from the central hub, but no mechanical articulation or joint-like features are visible between the tires.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the central wheel hubs been replaced with glowing mechanical eyes that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central wheel hub of the upright tire is emitting light and has features suggesting it is not merely a wheel hub. The blue light and energy stems suggest a design reminiscent of mechanical eyes or emitters, differing from Image A's standard tire hub.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there antennae-like structures extending from the top of the creature, featuring electric blue accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, there are electromagnetic looking structures extending from the central hub of the upright tire. They resemble antennae with electric blue coloring, although they are not extending from the top of a creature but from the hub itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature feature steampunk-style elements such as gears, rivets, or brass-colored metalwork, giving it a mechanical guardian appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not incorporate steampunk-style elements such as gears or brass-colored metalwork. The modifications are more in line with futuristic sci-fi design elements, focusing on electrical energy rather than traditional mechanical parts associated with steampunk.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the original tire tread patterns still visible and used as part of the creatureâ€™s armored exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of tires retains the original tread patterns visible in the tires. These patterns are used as part of the design, indicating that they form the exterior texture of the edited stack of tires.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the creature have a posture or design indicating it is capable of movement, such as being balanced on wheels or having rolling components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the upright wheel design, which inherently suggests that the tires could be part of a moving structure due to their inherent wheel-based design. The upright orientation of one tire, combined with the implied futuristic tech from the central hub, suggests potential motion capability relative to the wheel components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
