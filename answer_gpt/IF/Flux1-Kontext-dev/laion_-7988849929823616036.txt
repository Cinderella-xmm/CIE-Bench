    "Question": "Q1: Has the formal suit been replaced with a vibrant, floral-patterned design?",

    "Question": "Q5: Have the subjectâ€™s facial features, expression, and posture remained unchanged?",
    "explanation": "Both images have the subject's face blurred, so facial features and expression cannot be compared. However, assessing posture by means of body position reflected in the visible attire: Given that both images keep a similar position of shoulders and suit but face blur obscures the ability to verify more detailed elements, it implies the posture is maintained as there are no visible cues suggesting change.",
