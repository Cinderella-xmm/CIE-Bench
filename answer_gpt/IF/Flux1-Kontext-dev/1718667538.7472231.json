    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger figure is represented in a style that resembles cut-paper or illustration, with clear and defined edges. Unlike realistic shading that blends colors smoothly to simulate three-dimensional form, this style uses flat colors with no gradient transitions, maintaining a two-dimensional appearance. This portrayal lacks the depth and complexity of realistic rendering, confirming the cut-paper style characteristic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiger's stripes visibly wider and more stylized than natural tiger markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiger figure in Image B shows stripes that are bolder and more exaggerated compared to natural tiger markings. Such stylization is often employed in artistic depictions to emphasize certain features or to fit a particular artistic style, deviating from the realistic depiction of animal patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiger's whiskers noticeably longer and thicker than natural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the tiger's whiskers follows the exaggerated style of the entire depiction, appearing thicker and more pronounced than they would be in reality. Artists often alter proportions to suit stylistic choices or emphasize certain characteristics, which is evident here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kimono appear as if composed of multiple overlapping paper layers with distinct edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B has features that suggest it is designed in a style that appears layered, consistent with a paper-cut appearance. Each section of the kimono's design has distinct edges and colors that do not blend, indicative of a layered, paper-like design method.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there shiny, metallic gold accents on the cherry blossom patterns of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom patterns, while stylized, do not display any visual cues suggesting shiny, metallic gold accents. Such features would typically be apparent through reflective or highlighted areas portraying metallic qualities, which are absent here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any visible features such as perforations, tabs, or fold lines that would indicate parts of the image are meant to be detached. These elements are usually represented through lines or edges distinctly different from the rest of the artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible fold lines or structural elements suggesting the image can be physically folded or interacted with?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible fold lines or structural elements in Image B that suggest the image is designed to be physically folded or interacted with beyond viewing. These elements would typically be shown with clear markers that indicate folding or interaction points.",
