      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a stylized 3D chibi form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in Image B maintains realistic proportions and details similar to the expected natural appearance of zebras, without exaggerated or playful features typically associated with stylized 3D chibi art, such as larger heads or overly simplified facial features. Thus, the zebra in Image B does not fit the chibi stylization commonly seen in artistic renditions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the zebra's stripes in both images exhibit the same distinct black and white pattern seen in real zebras. The edited image retains this pattern without alteration, reflecting an accurate representation of the zebra's natural appearance as seen in the original photo.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the zebra inside an Instagram-like frame, with the animal's posture suggesting curiosity as it leans forward towards the cake. However, the zebra is not seated on the edge of the Instagram frame; it remains an outdoor scene rendered within the digital context of a social media post, maintaining its position relative to the cake similar to Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the top section of the visible Instagram frame carries the username 'ZebraLlnver', not 'ZebraLover'. This slight alteration or misspelling appears distinct from the proposed username, hence the choice of answer.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B reveals several recognizable social media icons dispersed around the Instagram frame, including like, comment, and share symbols. These elements contribute to the aesthetic of an interactive social media post, hence confirming their presence in the image.",
