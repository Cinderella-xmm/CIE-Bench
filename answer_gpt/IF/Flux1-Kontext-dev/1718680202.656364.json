        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I see the title 'A Capybara’s Escape' prominently displayed in a catchy, vibrant font arching above the capybara, near the Opera House. Based on my world knowledge, if a title like 'Sydney Escape' were present, it would likely be formatted similarly. Since the title displayed is not 'Sydney Escape,' the answer is No.",

      "question": "Does the image combine photorealistic rendering of the capybara and environment with illustrated or stylized elements (e.g., exaggerated features, cartoon-like details)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is there a bold, playful font used for the title, and is it arched above the Sydney Opera House?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bold and playful font used for the title 'A Capybara’s Escape.' This vibrant font adds a fun, energetic vibe to the picture and arches above the capybara to the side rather than above the Opera House itself. Hence, the comparison shows the font, but not quite arching above the Opera House.",
