        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts a snow globe resting within a cup. This is evidenced by the spherical glass structure surrounding the miniature versions of landmarks, which gives the appearance of a snow globe. The original latte art in Image A features designs within coffee cups, which has been transformed into this snow globe design. Therefore, the edited image does depict a snow globe.",
