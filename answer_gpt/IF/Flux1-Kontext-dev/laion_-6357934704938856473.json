      "question": "Does the robot exhibit a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B shows variations in texture with some parts exhibiting a more reflective surface, characteristic of a brushed metal finish, while other parts appear more subdued, consistent with a matte finish. The combination of these textures suggests the design intent for a dynamic and visually appealing surface typical in mecha designs.",

      "question": "Is the robot displayed inside a hexagonal box labeled \"MECHA VANGUARD\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is clearly displayed inside a box with a prominent label 'MECHA VANGUARD' on the front. The shape of the box is hexagonal, as deduced from the visible edges and corners.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B is holding a large sword and a gun, suggesting it may be designed to wield various weapons. However, there is no direct evidence of multiple weapon options or an implication that these weapons are interchangeable.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the armor plates of the robot do not exhibit detailed engravings or intricate patterns. The surface details seem more related to structural design than decorative engravings.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's design includes visible articulated joints at the shoulders and elbows, characteristic of functional and mobile limb connections. These joint designs are typical for mechanical models to simulate motion.",
