      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the staircase appears as a traditional architectural spiral staircase rather than being transformed into a serpent creature. The handrails and steps maintain the structure and appearance typical of a staircase, including the use of materials like stone and wood. The visual depiction does not introduce any serpent-like features but remains consistent with typical staircases found in buildings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steps in Image B are visually consistent with typical stairs, presenting a uniform, smooth surface usually associated with stone or concrete. They do not resemble segmented scales or any pattern that would be associated with reptilian skin. No transformation is evident that suggests a scale-like texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The railing in Image B maintains its original architectural design, appearing as a continuous, polished structure without any transformation into a spine-like or bone-like appearance. It retains its typical banister style without any modification to suggest vertebrae or segments mimicking bones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden handrails visible in Image B are part of the usual design of a spiral staircase, featuring no skeletal framework or features that would liken them to a serpent's body. The wood grain and structure are typical for staircases, showing no transformation into organic or skeletal-like forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth, clean look typical of well-maintained architectural stairs, without any stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures. The design is sleek and modern, without rugged or weathered elements associated with such textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spiral staircase in Image B maintains the typical construction of such architectural features, appearing as a precise and meticulously constructed element. While stairs naturally coil in a spiral form, there is no deliberate transformation to emphasize a serpent-like grace or fluidity beyond the expected design of the staircase.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent creature exhibit visual traits suggesting antiquity and natural grandeur (such as weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not transform the staircase into a serpent creature, thus lacking any attributes that would suggest antiquity or natural grandeur. It is seen as a clean, maintained architectural piece without signs of weathering, earthy elements, or organic forms typically associated with ancient or grand natural features.",
