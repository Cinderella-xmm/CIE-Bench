    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the scene (road, sky, trees, poles) fragmented into geometric shapes such as polygons, rectangles, and triangles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky features polygonal cloud shapes that are stylized rather than natural. The trees similarly display a rough geometric form, somewhat triangular, not truly spherical or rounded. The road and its markings also exhibit geometric design, notably in line formations and angular segments. These visual cues indicate a fragmented design favoring geometric shapes. ",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the road composed of angular, non-smooth sections instead of a smooth, curving surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the road appears to have notable angular features and abrupt edges in its depiction. The road and markings themselves adopt an angular form which contrasts with naturally smooth and curving shapes typical in roads. Therefore, the road in Image B is angular and non-smoothly segmented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clouds represented as overlapping quadrilateral or polygonal shapes rather than soft, natural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, clouds are distinctly illustrated with overlapping polygonal, block-like shapes. This abstraction departs from traditional soft and fluffy cloud formations, favoring a geometric representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the telegraph poles rendered in a stylized, geometric form using angular lines and shapes rather than realistic proportions and textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual characterization of telegraph poles in Image B shows them with straight, angular lines and simplistic forms lacking detailed textures. They are stylized in a manner consistent with geometric abstraction, different from realistic depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as abstract triangular shapes rather than natural, rounded tree canopies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are shown in a stylized design embracing abstract forms, somewhat triangular, contrasting the natural rounded shapes of actual tree canopies. This characteristic aligns with broader geometric abstraction present in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image use only muted greens, grays, and deep yellows, avoiding bright or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly utilizes muted and deep tone colors such as greens, grays, and yellows, contributing to the stylized and abstract quality. There is an absence of bright or highly saturated color usage, aligning the palette with a subdued spectrum.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clear sense of depth and perspective in the scene, with the road leading toward a distant horizon despite the geometric abstraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the geometric abstraction in Image B, the depiction of the road leading to a vanishing point creates a perceivable depth and perspective. The alignment and diminishing scale in road and pole structures offer visual clues leading to a clear distant horizon.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
