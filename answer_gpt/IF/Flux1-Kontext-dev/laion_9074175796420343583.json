    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pie depicted with human-like features such as a face and limbs, resembling a fussy old librarian?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie is given anthropomorphic features such as arms holding utensils, suggesting a human-like pose. This depiction, along with the presence of speech balloons and the mannerisms demonstrated, conveys the character of a librarian type, particularly considering the spoken phrases about silence and respect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the knife been visually altered to resemble a feather pen, and is it being held by the pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be a knife from its context has been stylized to look like a feather pen, which is often associated with old-fashioned writing tools. The character depicted (not a pie, but a person aligned with the librarian imagery) is holding this knife/pen in a firm manner, suggesting its use in the narrative.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lattice crust pattern visible on the pie character as a patterned apron, draped over its lower half?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no pie character showing a lattice pattern as a draped apron. Instead, the depiction includes a human-like figure with attire that could resemble a pattern but without clear indication of being a pie's crust or apron.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Scene 1 in Image B includes the text “Hush! Respect the quiet crust.” spoken by the primary character, however, there is no visual indication of other pastry characters actively appearing to chatter nearby. The scene focuses on the central figure.",

      "question": "Does Scene 2 contain the text “You’ll get a slice of silence!” and show the feather pen positioned above the pie in a stern, hovering manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Scene 2 of Image B, the text “You’ll got a slice of silence!” is indeed present. However, the feather pen is being held by the character, not hovering above a pie, as his attention seems to be directed at the pie below the pen. This reflects the comedic tone concerning silence and discipline.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is formatted as a comic strip divided into multiple (more than two) panels or scenes. These scenes are distinct from each other, indicating different moments in the narrative.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The style of Image B is illustrative with cartoonish elements. The narrative is depicted using exaggerated features and stylized characters consistent with typical cartoon art, distinguishing it from photorealism, which attempts to mimic real-life proportions and detail.",
