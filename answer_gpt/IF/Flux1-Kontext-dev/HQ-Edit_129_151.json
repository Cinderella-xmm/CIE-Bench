        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the art style features flat colors and strong outlines, which are typical of Japanese woodblock art.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows stylized trees and a pond with reflections, but the detailing is consistent with the woodblock art style which typically simplifies and stylizes rather than intricately detailing these elements. The scene captures the essence but not intricate detailing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a palette that includes green and brown hues, giving a natural and harmonious feeling. However, the colors are not deep as they are presented flat in the woodblock style, which uses muted, stylized colors rather than rich photo-realistic ones.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'The Duck Chessmaster's Wisdom' is present, but it is centered at the bottom of the image, not specifically in the lower right corner. The text style does not reflect elegant calligraphy as it appears more printed or stylized in line with the overall art style.",
