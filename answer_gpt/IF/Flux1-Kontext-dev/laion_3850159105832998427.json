      "question": "Has the body of the guitar been transformed into a dragon's torso with organic, beast-like features such as scales or musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the dragon depicted has a torso with organic and beast-like features, including scales and a muscular structure, indicative of typical dragon imagery. Image A presents the body of a guitar without such features, composed of smooth, polished wood typical for string instruments. The comparison shows no transformation of the guitar elements into dragon elements in Image B, as it remains separate and distinct.",

      "question": "Has the guitar neck been reshaped into an elongated, elegant dragon neck that extends naturally from the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's neck is elegantly elongated and extends naturally from its torso, common for dragon illustrations. Meanwhile, Image A displays an unchanged guitar neck with frets and a headstock, lacking any dragon-like transformation or integration. Thus, there is no evidence of a transition from guitar elements to dragon-like features in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays golden horns on the dragon's head, but Image A features traditional tuning pegs on the guitar's headstock. There is no transformation or replacement of guitar tuning pegs with dragon characteristics like horn-like spikes in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's wings feature decorative patterns, but these are not analogous to luminescent runes on a guitar fretboard. Image A shows a standard guitar fretboard with frets and dot markers without any luminescent or rune-like features. Image B does not exhibit the described transformation on the fretboard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dragon breathing fire, resembling tendrils of flames, but Image A contains conventional guitar strings stretching from the bridge to the nut without resemblance to flames. The comparison reveals that Image B does not depict the described feature on the guitar.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays intricate wings on the dragon with scale-like patterns, while Image A exhibits the guitarâ€™s cutaway horns in a smooth wooden design typical for the instrument, not transformed into wings. Therefore, there is no transformation observed in Image B.",
