      "question": "Has a butterfly been added above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the presence of a prominent butterfly in the mirror's reflection is evident. The butterfly covers a significant portion of the mirror, appearing directly on it rather than above. To identify its location, we look for visual cues like overlapping elements. It is clearly centered on the mirror itself. Image A lacks this butterfly, confirming the addition. Therefore, since the butterfly is within the mirror rather than positioned above it physically, the answer is clearly no based on a comparison of both images.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly golden in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the butterfly is depicted with bright orange wings accented with black and white markings. The description of 'golden' can correlate with a rich, warm yellow color similar to that of the butterfly's wings seen here. Considering common associations of 'golden' with warm, yellowish tones, the butterfly indeed fits this description in terms of appearance in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly placed above rather than beside or below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the butterfly centrally positioned against the mirror's surface, directly 'in' the reflection. The question implies a physical placement outside the mirror's reflection, which is not the case here. Based on its appearance in the reflection, the butterfly is not placed above or around the mirror physically. Therefore, it is not positioned above the mirror in a traditional sense.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly blend naturally with the lighting around the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an illuminated ring around the mirror that casts a warm glow similar to the butterfly's coloration, which can enhance integration. However, the silhouette on the mirror is distinctly separate from the lighting source behind it. Despite a complementary color scheme with the ambient lighting enhancing its visual harmony, the presence still feels distinct and noticeable as an addition rather than a seamless blend, due to the nature of reflections.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly maintain harmony with the overall environment of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's depiction of the warm-colored butterfly against the neutral tones of the bathroom suggests a contrast that is nonetheless visually appealing. The butterfly adds a burst of color matching the lighting's warm glow, enriching the decor without clashing with surrounding elements. Thus, it does not disrupt the aesthetic balance, integrating effectively within the setting, offering complementary enhancement rather than dissonance.",
