      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse exhibits a shiny, reflective surface consistent with glass material, and lacks the typical texture associated with plush fabric. The smoothness and glossiness observed suggest it is made of glass, rather than being soft and furry like in plush toys. Therefore, based on this visual cue and the common characteristics of glass materials, it can be concluded that the seahorse is made entirely of glass.",

      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse have a translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse appears shiny and smooth, typical of opaque glass materials, rather than translucent ones with visible bubbles. The surface shows clear reflections and irregular light patterns consistent with shiny glass but does not display any texture or bubbles that indicate translucency in glass or plastic. Therefore, based on these observations, the body does not have a translucent appearance with bubbles.",

      "question": "Is the belly section made of opaque yellow glass with an etched music note design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the belly section of the seahorse as smooth and glossy with a rich yellow color, indicative of opaque glass material. The music note design appears like a simple printed or engraved design, demonstrating characteristics typical of designs on glass products. The lack of any translucent effect in the belly section further supports the conclusion that it is opaque yellow glass. Therefore, considering these visual elements, it seems reasonable to conclude that the belly is made of opaque yellow glass with an etched or printed music note design.",

      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins made of lavender-colored glass instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ribbons on the seahorse's head and fins appear to possess a sheen and stiff structure often associated with glass. They reflect light in a way that is typical of glass rather than the flexible and soft texture of fabric. Unlike Image A where ribbons are obviously fabric, Image B reflects the properties of solid material like glass. Hence, based on these observations and the material properties of lavender-colored glass, it can be concluded that the ribbons are made of glass.",

      "question": "Is the seahorse placed on a reflective black display stand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base on which the seahorse stands has a glossy finish and mirrors reflections similar to surfaces typically used in display stands. The reflective quality and the black color are apparent and typical characteristics of display stands used to showcase art pieces. Comparing with Image A, which has no stand visible, the presence of a black stand in Image B is distinctive and used to highlight items visually. Therefore, analyzing these visual cues, it can be determined that the seahorse is placed on a reflective black display stand.",
