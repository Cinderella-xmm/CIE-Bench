      "question": "Is the pottery setup enclosed within a transparent glass cloche?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pottery setup is clearly housed inside a transparent glass cloche. This is visible as a dome-shaped clear glass covering can be seen encapsulating the pottery display, which is typical for decorative and protective purposes in displays or dioramas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clay pieces display a vibrant patina with visible coloration (e.g., green, blue, or copper tones) rather than plain gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clay pieces in Image B present vibrant blue tones, which starkly contrasts with the typical plain gray appearance of unglazed clay seen in Image A. This coloration suggests a deliberate artistic edit to make the pottery stand out more aesthetically.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there miniature fairy figures visible, actively kneading clay, and located among pottery tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains miniature fairy figures positioned around the base of the wooden structure. These figures appear engaged in an artistic setting but are not shown actively kneading clay close to the pottery tools, so they seem more decorative rather than interactive with the clay.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a base with artificial grass and small flowers surrounding the wooden table, implying edits were made to include these floral decorations, which are not present in Image A. These elements enhance the diorama, giving it a more lively and colorful appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden base beneath the glass cloche, with a distinct plaque featuring engraved text at its front. This plaque provides artisan details, an addition made in the edited version which is absent in Image A.",
