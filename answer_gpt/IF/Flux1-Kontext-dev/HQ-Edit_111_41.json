      "question": "Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is depicted with smooth surfaces and metal components, typical of a modern office chair design, rather than constructed from LEGO-style bricks. The lack of iconic visible studs or interlocking brick patterns common to LEGO indicates that this chair is not constructed from LEGO-style bricks. Therefore, based on the visual analysis, the chair is not constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks.",

      "question": "Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat and backrest cushions in Image B exhibit a sleek black leather-like texture, which resembles modern furniture materials and not LEGO bricks. The smooth finish and absence of block patterns typical of LEGO bricks suggest that the cushions are designed with realistic textures rather than resembling LEGO bricks, which typically have a distinct plastic look with visible connections and grooves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair's armrests and base clearly appear to be rendered in a silver color. This is evident from the metallic sheen and the color tone observed in these components, which matches the characteristics of silver. This observation is based on recognizing common materials used in office furniture and their visual representation in digital images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels of the chair in Image B appear to have a solid tone rather than transparency or translucency. They exhibit a gray color, but not the translucency that would be expected from translucent materials. The light reflection and clarity of edges seen in non-translucent objects suggest that the wheels are not translucent gray.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat and backrest in Image B show a smooth finish with distinct stitching and padding typical of leather without any visible layers or brick-like construction. The design showcases uniform texture with no gradients indicating transitions between layers that might resemble LEGO or brick constructions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests in Image B are metallic, with sleek curves and padding evident from the visual texture. They are not simplistic hinged parts but are rather complex with a structured curve consistent with modern ergonomic design. The detailing suggests a focus on comfort and aesthetic appeal, contrasting with simpler hinged designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the chair positioned against a plain white background, which might suggest placement on a tabletop. However, the visual context does not explicitly show a tabletop; it appears more likely to be placed on a white floor or platform suited for photographic presentations rather than a tabletop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the chair with a clean, modern design, emphasizing smooth surfaces rather than geometric modular construction typical of bricks. There is an absence of visible brick edges; instead, we see the smooth edges and curves of metallic components typical of office furniture rather than modular or brick-like construction.",
