      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted in a Funko Pop-style box with an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla is presented in a box that resembles the distinct packaging style of Funko Pop figures, which is characterized by bold block lettering, a large window to display the figure, and often, an isometric angle that showcases the contents at a slant. The visible angle confirms the use of an isometric perspective.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the box, along with the chibi gorilla, there are additional accessories like a leafy crown and a wooden staff.

        "No"
      ],

The style remains consistent with the simplified aesthetic of the Funko Pop design.",
