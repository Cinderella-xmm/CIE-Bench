    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are both feather earrings depicted with expressive facial features such as eyes and mouths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one feather earring is clearly depicted with an expressive facial feature, showing an eye, but neither feather earring displays a mouth. This indicates that while expressive facial features are present, they are not complete or include all expected elements like a mouth.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is one feather earring shown pulling the other along a visible path or trail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bird holding a single feather earring, and while there is a visible path in the background, the depiction does not include one earring pulling another specifically. The focus is more on the bird holding the earring rather than on an interaction between two earrings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble containing the exact text “Let's soar to new heights today!”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B contains the text 'LET'S SOAR A NEW HEIGHTS TODAY!!!' which does not exactly match the given text due to the inclusion of 'A' rather than the intended text 'to'. The correctness of a speech bubble involves precise text matching.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characters and elements outlined with bold, thick lines and rendered in vibrant, non-monochromatic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration style in Image B involves bold, thick outlines and vibrant colors for the characters and background elements, including the bird, earring, sky, and landscape. This aligns with the description of non-monochromatic and cartoon-like colors typical of comic-style illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a comic-style panel with a border and background elements such as wind or a path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly reflects a comic-style panel with a defined border surrounding the scene. The background contains elements such as a path and sky, but wind is not a visible element. The presence of comic-style elements confirms this presentation format.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the feather characters display exaggerated cartoonish features (such as large eyes or stylized limbs) while retaining some realistic feather details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction in Image B involves one feather character having an exaggerated eye and stylized appearances, combined with detailed feather-like characteristics. This blend of cartoonish exaggeration with some realistic feather elements fits the description.",
