    "Question": "Q3: Are the layers of lettuce and meat unchanged except for the addition of the flag and substitution of the tomato?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the lettuce layer appears fresh and vibrant, similar to standard sandwich presentations. However, the meat is not clearly visible; it seems replaced by a patty under the pineapple slice. Comparison with Image A is necessary: Image A has visible slices of meat under the tomato, while Image B has a grilled patty-like structure, indicating a possible substitution. Thus, there is a significant change in the components between the two images excluding just the flag or pineapple substitution.",
