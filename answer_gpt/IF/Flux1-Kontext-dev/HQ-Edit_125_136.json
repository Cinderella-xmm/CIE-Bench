    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top of the image, there's clearly visible text that reads 'ASTRONAUT AND SPACE STATION DYNAMICS.' This text is in large capital letters, making it the title of the infographic, as evident from its placement and prominence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects like the astronaut, Moon, and space station (ISS) are depicted using simple, flat colors and outlines typical of vector-style illustrations. These lack the depth, shading, and texture that would be present in photorealistic images, indicating a choice for a more simplified and stylized depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spacesuit include visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spacesuit in Image B is illustrated in a vectors-style format, which focuses on outlines and flat colors rather than detailed textures. Therefore, it lacks textural details like stitching or fabric patterns, which are characteristics expected in more detailed or photorealistic images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are gold accents used in the image to emphasize certain elements such as labels, borders, or arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a color palette that includes blues, whites, and some yellows for emphasis. While there are yellow accents present, they are not distinctly the metallic or deep yellow color typically associated with 'gold.' In this context, they don't serve as gold-like accents to highlight specific elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three sequential stages illustrated with arrows showing the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are panels showing the astronaut in different actions with arrows indicating transitions from one stage to another. However, these arrows do not clearly point to sequential stages specifically toward or interacting directly with a space station. The stages are depicted more related to movements on a lunar surface rather than directly involving a space station.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the labels “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, and “Step 3: Operate” displayed in sequence along the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom, there is text showing 'Step 1,' followed by 'Step 2: NAVIGATE' and '3 OPERATE,' which are phrases suggesting a sequence of actions. However, the terms ‘Prepare,’ ‘Navigate,’ and ‘Operate’ are not all completely spelled out as steps, as 'Step 1' doesn't include an action like 'Prepare.' Therefore, the full sequence 'Step 1: Prepare' is missing as described.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the entire infographic arranged in a vertical format with elements stacked from top to bottom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the infographic uses a more horizontal layout with elements not strictly stacked vertically. It has a title at the top with sections branching out, combining both vertical and horizontal alignments rather than a strictly top-to-bottom vertical format.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
