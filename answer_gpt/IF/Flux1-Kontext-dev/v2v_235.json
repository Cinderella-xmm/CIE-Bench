      "question": "Is the dancer depicted in a 3D chibi-style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dancer with realistic human proportions; the limbs, torso, and head reflect typical adult proportions rather than the exaggerated features characteristic of a chibi-style. Chibi characters typically have oversized heads and eyes and a more cartoonish appearance. Based on the visual cues, the dancer does not possess these features, indicating a more realistic rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dancer frozen mid-pose, accurately capturing their graceful movements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is captured in a dynamic pose with one leg elevated and arms extended, indicative of the elegant and precise movements associated with ballet dancers. This portrayal effectively showcases the balance and grace typical in ballet, demonstrating an accurate depiction of movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned stepping through a glowing elliptical portal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the dancer inside or interacting with a circular structure illuminated with glowing light. The light's circular shape resembles an elliptical portal, suggesting the dancer appears to be in close proximity, as if stepping through it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the portal's framework feature radiant hues of blue and purple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The portal in Image B is brightly lit with blue and purple colors, creating a vibrant and radiant appearance. The visual cues, such as the intense and vivid color shading along the portal's edge, affirm this colorful framework.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dancer extending their hand toward the viewer in a welcoming gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dancer's arms extended sideways. While not definitively directed towards the viewer, the positioning suggests a balanced part of the pose rather than a welcoming extension directly towards the spectator. The typical kinesis in ballet emphasizes equilibrium and form rather than interaction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the composition arranged in a 2:3 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aspect ratio refers to the width-to-height proportion of an image. Image B portrays a composition that appears narrower and more elongated, likely resembling a more traditional aspect ratio such as 1:1 or 16:9. Consequently, it does not conform to the 2:3 aspect ratio often used in portraits.",
