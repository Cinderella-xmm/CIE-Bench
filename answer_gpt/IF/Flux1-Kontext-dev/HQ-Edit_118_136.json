      "question": "Has the skater been replaced with a figure wearing sleek metallic armor and neon accents instead of a red hoodie and jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is wearing a hoodie, which appears to be in a different color due to the lighting but retains the casual clothing style of the original with jeans. This is consistent with the original clothing style except for the change in lighting and color tone. There is no indication of metallic armor or significant structural changes to the clothing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the skateboard now a hoverboard with a glowing, transparent deck and no visible wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard still has wheels, which can be seen clearly in the picture. Although the effect of glowing elements is present due to the lighting, the structure of the skateboard with visible wheels remains unchanged, indicating it has not been replaced by a hoverboard.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the skate park been replaced with a neon-lit urban environment featuring digital structures and artificial lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment around the skater showcases a night-time scene with neon effects, which gives the appearance of artificial lighting. However, the fundamental structure of the skate park, such as ramps and graffiti walls, remains the same, indicating the environment has not been replaced, but rather enhanced with neon lighting effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the graffiti elements in the scene animated or displaying digital, glowing, or interactive effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graffiti displays a vibrant neon glow, suggesting an enhancement with glowing effects. This does not indicate animation or digital interactivity but rather a visual style change consistent with the glowing theme of the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature dynamic motion lines around the skater to emphasize movement and speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any specific motion lines around the skater. The impression of movement largely relies on the skater's pose, which is dynamically captured in mid-air, but there are no added motion lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's pose and orientation remain consistent with Image A. The skater is depicted mid-air performing a trick with similar body posture and board position, indicating no change in pose or orientation.",
