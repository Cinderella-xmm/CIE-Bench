      "question": "Is the child depicted with exaggerated cartoon-style features such as large eyes, oversized head, or stylized expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child is shown with a realistic body size and proportions, without the characteristic features of cartoon-style exaggeration such as large eyes or an oversized head. The child's features and clothing are depicted in a way that resembles a real human, similar to Image A, suggesting there are no exaggerated features present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the coat and balloons rendered in pastel colors (soft, desaturated hues) rather than vibrant or saturated tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat and balloons are depicted in vibrant, saturated colors, such as bright yellow for the coat and deep blues, reds, and greens for the balloons. These colors are not pastel, as pastels would appear softer and more muted. The same vibrant and saturated tones are also observed in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the wheat field exhibit visible watercolor textures such as soft edges, blended colors, or brushstroke patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the wheat field includes elements of softness and blending that suggest a watercolor-like style. There are areas where colors blend smoothly, and the edges of the wheat are not sharply defined. This is consistent with watercolor techniques. The textural details in Image B align with what is seen in Image A, where similar watercolor-like textures are present.",

      "question": "Is there a calendar grid displayed below the child, appearing as if it is hanging or attached to the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of a calendar grid located below the child's feet, integrated into the overall scene. This grid appears to be part of the entire artwork, possibly serving as a decorative or thematic element. Image A does not contain a calendar grid, so this is a distinct and added element in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the balloons visually associated with individual days in the calendar grid, such that each balloon corresponds to a single day?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visual indication or alignment in Image B that associates each balloon with a specific day on the calendar grid. The balloons are shown as a separate visual element from the calendar, without clear connections to individual dates. Image A, devoid of a calendar, confirms this lack of association in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the sky rendered in a soft, light blue hue consistent with a gentle, seasonal atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the sky in a soft, light blue hue with fluffy clouds, which is typical of a gentle and serene atmosphere. This coloring enhances the light and open feeling of the scene, consistent with a pleasant seasonal vibe. Image A also exhibits the same sky characteristics, reaffirming this gentle atmosphere.",
