    "Question": "Q1: Has the spiral staircase been fully replaced by a serpent-shaped form that follows the same helical path?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), part of the staircase is obscured by the serpent. However, the shape follows the spiral path of the staircase, with the serpent wrapping around the central structure. While the serpent mimics the helical path, it does not fully replace the staircase itself, as the stairs and some railing elements are still visible. The serpent intertwines with the existing architecture rather than wholly replaces it.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the serpent’s body feature detailed lattice-like scales across its surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body is visible and shows individual scales. However, these scales are not lattice-like in design. Lattice implies an interconnected, woven pattern akin to a grid, whereas the serpent here appears to have more traditional reptilian scales. There is a texture across its surface, but it does not fit the lattice description.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the serpent’s body extended downward in a way that visually replicates the step-like descent of the original staircase?",
    "explanation": "The serpent's body in Image B does travel downwards following the spiral, but it does not mimic the step-by-step descent that characterizes a staircase. It gracefully coils in a smooth, continuous manner without replicating the distinct step pattern of the original stairs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are ornate, filigree-like patterns present on the serpent’s body, matching the style of the original railing?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the serpent's body does not have ornate filigree-like patterns similar to those on the railing. The railing contains intricate scrollwork matching decorative metalwork, but the serpent's scales do not feature such patterns; they appear as typical reptile scales instead.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the banister been replaced with a series of delicate, translucent fins along the serpent’s side?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the banister is partially obscured by the serpent, but it does not seem to have been replaced entirely with a different structure. The serpent has fins or frills which are visible, but these are additions to its body and not a replacement for the banister. The visual of the banister remains intact.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a serpent’s head positioned at the uppermost point of the spiral, featuring two distinct luminescent gem-like eyes?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the serpent’s head is positioned near the top of the spiral staircase and is quite prominent. It does feature eyes that resemble luminescent gems, which are vivid and distinct, capturing the observer’s attention.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the serpent’s body display a marble-like texture with visible veining and polished surface characteristics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body texture resembles traditional reptilian scales rather than a marble surface. Marble often has a smooth, veined appearance and a polished look, which is not characteristic of the serpent shown. Its texture is more aligned with organic scales than stone.",
    "answer": "No"
