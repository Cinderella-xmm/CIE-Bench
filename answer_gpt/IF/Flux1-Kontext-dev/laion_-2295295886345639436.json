      "question": "Is the title 'The Evolution of Strength through Time' present and clearly visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title at the top of the image appears to be partially garbled or misprinted, as it reads 'THE EVOLUWTIQI COF STRENGTH OENIIE (T?AN)', which does not clearly convey the phrase 'The Evolution of Strength through Time'. The visual cues and the presentation seem to imply this meaning, but it is not clearly visible due to the misprinting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three distinct representations of the character corresponding to Antiquity, Feudal Era, and Modern Era?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image presents three distinct characters, each labeled 'ARTICIIY', 'FEUDAL ERA', and 'MODERN ERA' respectively. The appearance and attire of each character are significantly different from one another, representing three different eras: Antiquity, Feudal Era, and Modern Era. This leads to the conclusion that the image distinctly displays the three periods.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the Antiquity version of the character include mythological armor characteristic of Ancient Greek warriors or wrestlers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character representing the Antiquity period is depicted wearing a short tunic or kilt-like garment that is more characteristic of ancient civilians or athletes such as wrestlers rather than soldiers. There is no mythological armor visible on this character in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character representative of the Feudal Era is clearly depicted wearing heavy armor that includes a helmet, shoulder pads, and a breastplate. This character is also holding a sword, which fits the typical representation of a European knight's attire during the Feudal Era.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character representing the Modern Era is depicted wearing shorts and is holding a barbell across the shoulders, indicative of someone engaged in weightlifting or athletic activity. This matches the description provided.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features and expressions of the characters are blurred and not clearly visible. The assumption is that the heads are meant to be different for each era, but based on the blurred depiction, a definitive comparison cannot be made.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the attire and posture in each era depicted with sufficient detail to distinguish them as representative of their respective time periods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the face being blurred, the attire, posture, and props of each character are distinctly representative of their corresponding eras: the Antiquity figure with a tunic, the Feudal Era knight with armor and a sword, and the Modern Era athlete with shorts and a barbell. Each depiction provides clear visual cues for the respective time periods.",
