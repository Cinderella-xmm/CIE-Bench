    "Question": "Q3: Has the interaction pose of the chibi characters by the railing been maintained?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are positioned facing each other, suggesting interaction.

    "Question": "Q4: Are the chibi characters depicted in a flat, cartoonish style with thick outlines?",
