    "Question": "Q1: Has the tagine dish been transformed into a genie lamp shape with a bulbous body and narrow neck?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the object resembles a traditional tagine with its conical lid and round base rather than a genie lamp, which typically has a bulbous body and a long, narrow spout.
