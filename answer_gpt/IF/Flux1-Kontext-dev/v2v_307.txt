    "Question": "Q1: Does the packaging resemble a Funko Pop figure box in design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging has a design similar to that of a typical Funko Pop box. It features a window showing the contents inside, a cartoon character illustration, and a large, bold number indicating a series number.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the packaging illustrated from an isometric perspective?",

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a realistic version of the bandage displayed outside the packaging, showing intricate details like fabric texture and adhesive surface?",
