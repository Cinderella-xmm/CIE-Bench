      "question": "Are the armrests of the sofa transformed into curled horn-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests of the sofa have been visually transformed into structures that resemble horns. This is evident through the shape and texture, which are not typical for a standard sofa but are in line with the aesthetic often associated with mythical or fantasy themes. The presence of these prominent horn-like formations for each armrest indicates a clear deviation from standard sofa design.",

      "question": "Have the tufted patterns on the sofa been replaced with bark-textured scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of tufted patterns seen on traditional sofas which might involve stitching or button details, the surface displays textures that resemble bark, suggesting a scale-like surface akin to that of a tree's bark. This transformation aligns with fantasy or natural motifs rather than original furniture design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cushions in Image B appear to be covered in thick, green fur, giving the appearance of a mossy, leafy mane. This transformation departs from typical upholstery found on a sofa, resembling characteristics commonly associated with grass or foliage, fitting a natural or fantastical theme.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bright, glowing eyes above the cushions of the sofa, positioned symmetrically above each of the three seat sections. These glowing elements are stylized notably in an emerald hue, typical of supernatural or fantasy narratives.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Beneath the sofa in Image B, there are structures resembling wooden limbs with detailed claw features. These protrude in a way that gives the appearance of legs, deviating from normal sofa bottoms and invoking a mythical creature motif.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is characterized by fantastical elements such as glowing eyes, horn-like armrests, and a fur-like surface, but there are no additional indications of mythical energy such as ethereal particles or aura on the surface distinct from these transformations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the spherical additions of horns, eyes, and textured surfaces, the overall structure and positioning of the sofa in Image B remain consistent with Image A. It maintains the original form as a three-seater with the same dimensions, while integrating these mythical features seamlessly.",
