    "Question": "Q2: Are the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear of the skiers identical to those in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skiers are wearing outfits of the same color as Image A, with a red jacket for the left skier and a blue jacket for the right skier. Both also have backpacks and ski poles, similar to Image A. However, the design and details are different.
