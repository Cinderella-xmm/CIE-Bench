    "Question": "Q1: Has the circular dough been replaced with a realistic atom illustration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a realistic atom illustration displayed in the top row, center. However, it is still not highly realistic and resembles more of a stylized depiction for cookies, much like what's seen with the cookie stamping depiction from Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there multiple atom-shaped cookie designs centered in the image, each in a different color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, six different atom-shaped cookie cutters and stamps are presented, each in a distinct color: red, orange, green, light blue, yellow, and a plain dough color for a stamped impression. This contrasts with Image A, which features just one cookie and cutter design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there arrows pointing to and labeling electrons, protons, and neutrons on the atom illustrations?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes arrows that point to different cookie cutter designs, with text labels such as 'ELECTRONS,' 'PROTONS,' and 'NEUTRONS,' indicating specific parts of atomic structures, unlike the single cookie design in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the text in the image displayed using a playful, whimsical font?",

    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the color scheme of the image harmonize with the natural tones of the dough and cutter (beige, brown, white)?",
    "explanation": "While Image B introduces bright colors for the atom designs, the background tone and the focus on cookie cutting maintain a semblance of harmony with natural tones. However, the variety in coloration moves away from a strictly natural scheme that was present in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
},
{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the title “Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry” clearly displayed in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title displayed is 'Atoms & Cookies: Pa vyloosn Chemistry,' not 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry,' reflecting a playful yet clear intention not matching directly with the latter statement.",
    "answer": "No"
