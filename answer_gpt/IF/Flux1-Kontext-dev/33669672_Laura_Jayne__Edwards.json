        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to have a shiny, metallic surface typical of bronze sculptures. This is suggested by the even, reflective surface and the characteristic bronze coloring of the limbs and platform.",

        "No"
      ],
