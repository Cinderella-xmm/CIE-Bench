      "question": "Is the woman's figure stylized in a cartoon-like manner with exaggerated proportions or simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's figure does show some stylization due to the editing and transformation into a painting-like depiction with noticeable alterations in texture and appearance. However, the figure itself maintains realistic human proportions without exaggerated features. This suggests the representation leans towards realistic rather than cartoon-like stylization.",

      "question": "Are there visible gold embroidery details added to the red dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress maintains the color and texture as seen in the original, without any visible changes like gold embroidery details. The dress remains consistent in its appearance without additional adornments.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings significantly larger than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly wings in Image B appear slightly altered in texture to fit the aesthetic changes of the entire composition, but they are not significantly larger than in Image A. Both images depict the wings in substantial size relative to the figure without notable differences in their dimensions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the butterfly wings feature detailed, intricate textures such as fine veins or layered patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly wings in Image B maintain a texture that complements the painting-like style applied to the image. While the image transformation adds a canvas-like texture, the wings do not prominently display intricate details such as fine veins or layered patterns typically associated with realistic butterfly wing depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the names of all twelve months displayed on the butterfly wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows text primarily in the border area above the wings but does not display the names of all twelve months on the butterfly wings themselves. The focus is on decorative text surrounding the central figure rather than a detailed calendar representation on the wings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire composition placed on a wooden panel that includes floral inlay patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the entire composition on a wooden panel with visible floral patterns and decorative text that resembles intricate inlay work around the frame. This editing adds to the stylized appearance and shifts the context from a photograph to a framed artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the final image include design elements (such as wood grain, floral patterns, or embossed text) that suggest it is intended as a collectible item?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inclusion of a wooden frame with floral inlay designs, decorative text, and a stylized appearance in Image B creates an impression of a crafted collectible item rather than a simple photograph. These elements contribute to suggesting the image's intent as a collectible artwork.",
