      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To compare, in Image A, original objects like the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with cherry blossoms, and mats are distinctly arranged on the table. In Image B, although the diagram is added, these objects remain in their original positions and with similar appearances, confirming they are unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the added diagram avoid overlapping or obscuring any of the original table elements and instead flow naturally around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the diagram elements like lines and icons are methodically placed such that they skirt around the original objects on the table. There are no overlaps that obscure the tea set or decorations; rather, the annotations and lines flow in a manner that respects the spatial arrangement of the table setting.",
