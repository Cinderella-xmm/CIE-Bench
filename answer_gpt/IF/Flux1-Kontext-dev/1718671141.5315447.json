        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building displays elements suggesting a steampunk aesthetic, including the presence of large, decorative brass gears. These are commonly associated with steampunk design, which incorporates mechanical features and Victorian-era aesthetics. The visibility of such gears, integrated into the building's exterior, is noted. Therefore, based on these observations, the answer is: Yes.",
