    "Question": "Q1: Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects displayed are spheres and cubes, not LEGO brick shapes. The marbled patterns remain consistent with the original design. My understanding of world knowledge tells me that LEGO bricks have distinct geometric shapes typically rectangular with studs for interlocking, whereas these objects do not exhibit those features. This indicates that the spheres and cubes are not replaced with LEGO brick shapes.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects feature a glossy finish, not a matte texture, as indicated by visible reflections and highlights on the surfaces. World knowledge regarding LEGO bricks suggests they can have various finishes, but in context, the image shows spheres and cubes without typical LEGO characteristics, and they exhibit a glossy texture, not matte.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the spheres and cubes randomly scattered in a manner that resembles natural spilling rather than a deliberate orderly arrangement. The objects do rest on a wooden surface, however, without the visible structure that would be associated with LEGO bricks being stacked or organized in a regular pattern. Achieving structured patterns would involve alignment typically seen in manufactured products, not seemingly unorganized alignments.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the LEGO bricks display subtle interlocking details such as studs or recessed connectors?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display objects possessing interlocking details such as studs or recessed connectors. The spheres and cubes lack typical LEGO features that allow for interlocking, which are integral to LEGO design for piece connectivity. The objects appear smooth, not featuring any of the practical design characteristics for LEGO assembly.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the background simplified into a clean, uniform, and uncluttered minimalist style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a wooden shelf that does appear simple and unobtrusive, contributing to an overall uncluttered composition. Using world knowledge regarding minimalist design, which emphasizes simplicity, the clean lines and lack of ornaments fit a minimalist aesthetic. The presence of the wooden shelf contributes to a uniform background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
