      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a visually striking appearance due to its use of bold lines and geometric shapes, like diamonds and stars. These geometric designs are prominent, visually centering attention on the artistic expression rather than a realistic representation. The use of contrasting colors and shapes makes it striking and noticeable, presenting a strong emphasis on geometric patterns throughout the image. This aligns with the notion of creating an attention-grabbing visual piece, consistent with design choices that prioritize geometric forms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard, kitchen sink, and cabinets are made prominent in Image B by the stained glass effect and geometric designs. The vibrant colors and design patterns create an emphasis on these objects, making them more noticeable and detailed than in a typical image. The geometric elements added to the skateboard, like stars and angular shapes on the cabinets, help draw attention, creating a visual contrast that ensures these objects stand out substantially within the artwork.",
