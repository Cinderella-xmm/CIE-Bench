      "question": "Have the guitar and microphone been converted into chibi-style 3D cartoon designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the guitar and microphone possess exaggerated proportions, vibrant colors, and a playful, simplified aesthetic typical of chibi-style and 3D cartoon designs. This includes the bright blue and orange colors of the guitar and the clean, round shapes used throughout. These elements contrast with more realistic portrayals, which would feature subtler colors and more detailed forms. This suggests that the image employs a chibi-style 3D cartoon design.",
