    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the object now a tall, rectangular glass vessel instead of a soft-sided suitcase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears as a tall, rectangular structure with transparent walls, resembling a glass vessel common in perfume bottles or other liquid containers. This contrasts with the fabric texture visible in Image A indicating a suitcase, thus confirming the transformation to a glass vessel.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top part of Image B showcases a metallic section typical of spray nozzles found on perfume bottles, suggesting a transformation. Image A displays a retractable handle typical for suitcases, highlighting the change in purpose and design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the side and front panels now made of translucent purple-tinted material instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows panels that are translucent and purple-tinted, like colored glass or plastic, contrasting with Image A's opaque fabric material. Such materials are often used in cosmetic containers, indicating a shift in material type and transparency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original seam lines preserved as embossed linear patterns on the surface of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design seems to maintain linear patterns that mimic seam lines, giving the illusion of embossing on the vessel’s surface. Image A has visible seam lines on the fabric suggesting structural division, which have been aesthetically retained in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a logo near the top, consistent in style and location with etched logos seen on bottles, providing brand identity. Image A features a logo in a similar area but it’s likely embroidered or attached on the fabric, maintaining visual prominence in the transformation.",
