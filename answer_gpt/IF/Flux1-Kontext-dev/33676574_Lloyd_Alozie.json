      "question": "Do the skyscrapers appear as integrated, articulated robotic limbs forming a larger guardian-like figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers do not appear as articulated robotic limbs. Instead, there is a giant robotic figure distinct from the buildings seen standing in front of them. This is indicated by the clear separation and design differential between the infrastructure and the robotic figure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible neon circuitry patterns running along the facades of the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings do show elements of neon lighting, primarily in blue, which enhances the technological and futuristic appearance. However, these do not necessarily form patterns resembling circuitry. Instead, the lighting is linear and geometrical, contributing more to an aesthetic design than functionally representing circuit patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the building facades feature reflective, scale-like panels arranged in an overlapping or segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's building facades are primarily highlighted with neon outlines and sleek surfaces common in futuristic or digitally rendered cityscapes. The lighting and facade treatments do not mimic scale-like overlapping panels, but rather focus on clean lines and illumination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the expressways depicted as glowing, curving, spine-like structures emitting light and winding through the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly shows light trails that mimic expressways or roads, glowing vibrantly, and these trails do indeed curve and wind in a manner that could be interpreted as spine-like. This visual effect is enhanced by the futuristic context established throughout the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of the buildings feature enhanced, fin-like vertical structures that resemble mechanical protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of some buildings have vertical structures that are enhanced with neon lights and could resemble mechanical fins, especially given the context of a futuristic city skyline. This design choice seems consistent with the overall aesthetic of integrating technology with architecture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there rotating holographic elements positioned across the skyline that resemble pulsing, eye-like forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct glowing circular element to the right of the robotic figure, which could resemble a rotating holographic element. However, this is the only such element visible and distinct across the skyline, and it is limited in quantity to fully appear as a feature spread across the entire skyline.",
