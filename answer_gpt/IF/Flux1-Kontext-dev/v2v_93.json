      "question": "Is the thermometer depicted in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is presented with realistic features, such as a metallic finish and detailed, precise dial markings. The style is consistent with a realistic depiction rather than a 3D cartoon style, which typically includes exaggerated proportions, bright colors, or whimsical elements. Thus, the thermometer in Image B is not depicted in a 3D cartoon style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image use soft lighting to highlight the thermometer's metallic finish and clearly visible dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is rendered with attention to detail, where the metallic finish reflects light, creating a soft highlight effect. This aids in making the dial and its markings clearly visible, thus suggesting the use of soft lighting to achieve this effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] clearly incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the thermometer, there is text indicating '[Temperature Range +200]' and '[Accuracy +10°C]'. However, the display of '[Accuracy 3+10 ≠°C]' is nonsensical and incorrect, which suggests incorrect incorporation of these stats in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly visible title banner at the top of the image that reads 'PRECISION THERMAL GAUGE'. This indicates the banner as a part of the image layout, providing context to the viewer.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a nameplate at the bottom that includes text such as 'NB HUDUMONEFOR (Temperature Range +200)' and 'Thempornmuter (Accuracy 3+10 ≠°C)'. Although the text is quirky and nonsensical, it serves as a nameplate identifying certain specifications and designations of the item depicted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a blue border surrounding the main content, giving the appearance of a bordered card. The crispness of the border aids in neatly framing the image content.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is in shades of blue, a color often associated with calmness, professionalism, and technology. This choice of color reflects a professional tone and subtly suggests scientific precision, appropriate for a technical instrument like a thermometer.",
