      "question": "Has the body of the teapot been transformed into a sleek cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question is not a teapot but a canister, as evidenced by its cylindrical form. This shape clearly contrasts the rounded, bulbous shape typical of teapots, which usually have a body, spout, and handle, as seen in Image A. Thus, the teapot has been transformed into a cylindrical shape as a canister.",

      "question": "Are the dragon engravings still present and visibly detailed on the body of the canister?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the canister does not feature dragon engravings; instead, tea leaf patterns are present. This is a change from Image A, where a dragon is prominently engraved on the teapot. Therefore, dragon engravings are not present on the canister.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the original hinged lid been replaced with a metallic screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a different lid design compared to Image A. The teapot in Image A has a hinged lid typically associated with teapots, whereas Image B has a removable lid that resembles a screw cap, typical for containers or canisters, indicating that it was changed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are intricate tea leaf patterns embossed around the circumference of the screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tea leaf patterns are visible on the body of the canister but not around the circumference of the screw cap. The screw cap itself appears smooth and without embossed patterns. The detailing is limited to the main body of the canister.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" visibly inscribed along the length of the spout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the text 'Dragon's Delight' on the cylindrical body of the canister, not along the length of the spout, which would be challenging due to its curved nature. Image A's spout also does not feature any text inscriptions. Thus, the text is on the canister body, not the spout.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {

      "question": "Is there a minimalist tea leaf logo located on the top center of the screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, atop the screw cap, there is a small decorative element in the form of simplified tea leaves, suggesting a minimalist design based on tea leaf inspiration. This logo is indeed located at the top center of the screw cap.",
