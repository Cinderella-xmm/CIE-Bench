      "question": "Is the clock's frame made of translucent crystal instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock's frame has a white, glossy appearance reminiscent of crystal or polished material, which gives the impression of a translucent quality compared to natural wood textures. The color and finish suggest a more refined, possibly crystal or glass-like material rather than wood, as observed through the white and reflective qualities. Image A, by contrast, has a darker, grained surface typical of wood. This difference, coupled with the articulate details and polished nature found in Image B, supports a conclusion of crystal-like material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ornamental details and frame of the clock crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details appear intricately designed with a consistent white color and glossy, refined finish, suggesting they might be made of frosted crystal. This stands in contrast to Image A's more organic and raw wooden carvings. The ornate pieces in Image B, due to their smooth and polished appearance, support the suggestion of being crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood.",

      "question": "Is the clock face made of smooth, clear crystal with etched Roman numerals instead of a wooden face with painted numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is white and smooth, with a high level of detail and Roman numerals that appear to be integrated into the material rather than painted on. This offers a strong indication of a crystal-like, etched design. In Image A, the clock face has a wooden appearance with a textured surface and painted numerals typical of traditional wooden designs. The comparison highlights the change from a wooden to a possibly crystal-based clock face in Image B.",

      "question": "Has the pendulum been replaced with a faceted crystal ornament instead of a solid wooden disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum is a shiny, faceted object resembling crystal, showing light reflection and refraction, displaying multiple surfaces, indicative of a cut crystal. In comparison, Image A's pendulum is a solid, flat disc with wooden texture. The transformation from a wooden disc to a reflective, multi-faceted piece suggests a clear replacement with a crystal ornament.",

      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a minimalist white marble wall with visible natural veining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a white surface with subtle veining patterns consistent with marble. The clean, minimalist white and grey contrast closely resembles marble patterns. For comparison, Image A features a darker, more textured background more representative of painted or plastered walls. The veining and color contrast seen in Image B confirm the presence of a marble-like wall.",
