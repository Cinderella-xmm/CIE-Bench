      "question": "Is the image formatted as an educational infographic with structured layout elements such as titles, labels, and text boxes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent title 'Butterfly Biology Basics' at the top, along with several text boxes distributed around the butterfly image. These text boxes use arrows to point to different parts of the image, suggesting a structured layout commonly found in educational infographics. Based on these visual cues, it can be deduced that the image is formatted as an educational infographic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Butterfly Biology Basics' is visibly placed at the top of the image, appearing prominently in large, bold text. This placement is typical for titles in infographics to immediately inform the viewer about the subject of the content.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax) labeled with monochrome line-drawing overlays on the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are text boxes pointing towards parts of the butterfly, the visual analysis does not show monochrome line-drawing overlays directly on the butterfly itself. Instead, the labels are in the form of text boxes with arrows, which are not described as monochrome line-drawing overlays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are pink flower petals included in the image to represent the butterfly’s feeding preference?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible pink flower petals beneath the butterfly. The inclusion of such flowers often suggests the butterfly's feeding preferences, as butterflies are known to be attracted to vibrant flowers for nectar. These visual elements imply that the pink petals may represent this aspect of the butterfly’s behavior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there text boxes in the image that explain the butterfly’s role in pollination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a text box near the bottom right, which includes text about the butterfly's role in pollination. Although the exact text appears distorted or gibberish, the structuring and location of this text box suggest it is meant to describe the butterfly's ecological role.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned prominently in the center of the composition, and its vibrant blue color stands out against the green background and pink flowers. The delicate detailing of the butterfly's wings and the color contrast with the background emphasize it as the central focal point of the image, contributing to a delicate visual style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B retains the same vibrant blue appearance as in Image A. Despite additional text and graphical elements, the butterfly itself remains unchanged and fully visible, indicating it is still clearly intact in the edited image.",
