    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the individual depicted as a dynamic, chibi-style 3D figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual retains the realistic proportions and appearance as seen in Image A. A chibi-style figure typically has oversized heads and smaller bodies, creating an exaggerated, cartoon-like appearance. Therefore, the individual in the snow globe does not exhibit these features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character performing a skateboarding trick inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual is captured mid-air while performing a skateboard trick, and this action is taking place inside the snow globe. This matches the dynamic skateboarding maneuver shown outside the snow globe in Image A, establishing continuity in the trick being performed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the snow globe shows palm trees and a skate park environment, which includes ramps. The visuals within the globe replicate the setting outside, indicating the presence of these elements on a smaller scale within the snow globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is snow gently falling inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is a visual effect of white particles suspended inside the snow globe, which resemble snowflakes. This creates the impression of snow gently falling within the globe, consistent with the conventional idea of a snow globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a table near a window, with the window overlooking a blurred skate park?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is clearly positioned on a table surface near a window. Through the window, a blurred green landscape is visible, suggesting the external environment is a park-like setting, though not specifically a skate park. The table and window placement is evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do rays of light filter through the glass, creating radiant highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows light interacting with the glass of the snow globe, producing bright reflections and highlights, particularly when positioned near the window with visible sunlight streaming in. This effect creates radiant highlights, enhancing the image's visual dynamics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the original background been replaced with the described setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A presents an outdoor skate park scene with palm trees and ramps, all in natural lighting. Image B situates these elements inside a snow globe and integrates them into an indoor setting placed on a table by a window. The original outdoor scene serves as the backdrop inside the snow globe, implying a change of context rather than a complete background replacement.",
