      "question": "Is the door now visually transformed into a mystical guardian creature with distinct animalistic or mythical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the door adorned with elements that carry mythical connotations. The presence of wings and a crown on the door, along with its appearance surrounded by a celestial background, suggest a transformation into a figure that could be perceived as a mystical guardian or a mythical creature. This interpretation arises based on the combination of such elements not typically associated with a simple wooden door.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there feathered wings extending from the sides of the door, formed by the extension of the original geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly visible wings extending from either side of the door, colored in blue and white, which are distinct additions beyond the original geometric patterns seen in Image A. The wings are separate visual additions carrying a mythical character enhancement rather than extensions of the original design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the metal knobs on the door retain their appearance without transforming into eye-like features. While Image B has enhanced visual elements such as the crown and celestial decorations, the knobs maintain their original form without displaying additional reflective or glowing traits.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show additional etched runes or symbolic inscriptions on the wooden surface of the door itself. The surface remains with its original intricate pattern but does not feature any new distinct symbols or inscriptions beyond the added mystical elements.",
