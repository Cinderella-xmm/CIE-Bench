      "question": "Has the map and the pins been transformed into a ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are significantly more vibrant, and the lines are more prominent, giving an artistic and stylized impression. However, there is no evidence of a ceramic or mosaic texture that would typically give rise to the notion of a tile artwork. The materials still resemble paper and plastic as there is no visible texture that aligns with ceramics or tiles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the mosaic artwork display bold patterns and rich textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases bolder lines and more vibrant colors than Image A, which creates a more intense and dynamic visual presence. However, these visual traits are not indicative of rich textures, which would suggest a 3D effect or a tactile quality associated with mosaics that Image B lacks. The patterns appear enhanced but not textured.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the original layout and positioning of the map and pins been maintained in the mosaic artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image A and Image B, it is evident that both images share the same layout and positioning of the map and pins, as the pins and their corresponding locations remain consistent in both images. The spatial arrangement has not been altered despite the heightened colors and lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mosaic artwork convey a lively appearance through vibrant colors and dynamic designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual comparison highlights vibrant and saturated colors in Image B, which gives it a lively appearance. The design structure, while still simple (due to the map and pin concept), feels more dynamic with the contrast and saturation amped up. This lively and vivid appearance is achieved through the use of enhanced hues rather than intricate design changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the map and pins appear to be made of ceramic tiles rather than their original materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though Image B features increased saturation and bold outlines, the lack of ceramic-like texture or shine indicates that the materials appear unchanged from Image Aâ€”still paper for the map and plastic for the pins. There is no definitive ceramic tile representation in the visual attributes of Image B.",
