    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall image framed or designed to resemble a product label with defined edges and layout consistent with a beverage packaging design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design has a defined edge and organized layout, characterized by a bright yellow background and centralized graphics, typical features of a product label designed for attraction and brand identity.

    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible, stylized streaks of sand in the background that convey motion and act as graphic elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B is stylized to include graphic elements that resemble streaks radiating from the center where the motorcycle is located. These streaks are not specifically sand but interpret motion visually, aligning with artistic representations of speed and dynamics without realistic depiction. This technique is often used to convey movement in simplified illustrations.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the text 'RaceFuel' displayed in bold, prominent typography somewhere within the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'FUEL' is visible in bold, impactful typography, which is prominently placed with a visual emphasis that complements the overall theme.

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a track outline visible in the image, rendered in bright, vivid colors (e.g., red, yellow, blue) and positioned as an overlay?",
    "explanation": "An outline of a track is not present in Image B. The graphic elements focus on the central rider, and the only colored bright elements are the background and accents on the motorcycle, not a track outline.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a speedometer icon located at the bottom of the image, showing a needle pointing to the maximum speed?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes a speedometer at the bottom center of the design. However, the needle is pointing towards a numeric '60' that suggests there's more room to the maximum, rather than the maximum speed itself, which would typically be at the far edge. Still, its inclusion suggests speed and intensity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the combined visual elements—silhouette, streaks, typography, track, and speedometer—collectively communicate a narrative of power and speed?",
    "explanation": "Image B leverages dynamic elements such as the silhouette of the rider, a vibrant burst of streaks, bold typography, and the presence of a speedometer to convey a strong theme of power and speed. These visual components are strategically used to invoke the excitement and motion typical in racing contexts, albeit without a literal track depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
