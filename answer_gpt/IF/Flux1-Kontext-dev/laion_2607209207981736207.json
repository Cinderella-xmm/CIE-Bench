    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original scanner completely replaced by a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original scanner is placed inside a futuristic style box or packaging design, as indicated by the additional elements like the 'SCANNER' and 'SALIICANR' text and the blue neon-like glow around the scanner on the packaging front. The scanner itself is still visibly present as the main element within this concept packaging, suggesting that it is encased rather than completely replaced. Therefore, the design integrates the actual product appearance with a packaging visuals overlay.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the packaging feature visible metallic textures such as brushed metal, chrome, or reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the packaging is dominated by a sleek digital overlay with a neon glow. There are no distinct visual indications such as reflections or specific surface highlights that commonly denote metallic textures like brushed metal or chrome. The overall appearance is more digital with a glowing blue design theme rather than metallic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging exhibit an iridescent color effect with shifting hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B primarily displays a consistent neon blue glow surrounding the featured scanner and its packaging design background. There is no visual evidence of an iridescent finish that would manifest as multiple shifting hues or a gradient of colors changing with perspective; the color palette remains constant.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a holographic display on the front of the packaging showing the scanner in operation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit a holographic display feature; instead, it has a visually stylized graphic of the scanner around which blue neon-like accents are designed, giving it a tech-futuristic aesthetic. This design visually enhances the scanner's appearance but is not indicative of a holographic display showing it in operation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible grid lines or circuit-like patterns across the surface of the packaging that resemble data flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging design includes subtle circuit-like patterns and elements suggesting a data-flow theme, such as the faint outlines and digital motifs around the scanner. These details contribute to the tech-themed aesthetic seen in this stylized packaging design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there tech-themed icons (e.g., circuits, data streams, digital symbols) and modern branding elements visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a visible tech-theme as seen with the digital glow around the scanner, circuit-like elements, and accompanying text that contributes to modern branding on the packaging container, all of which prominently reside around the scanner depiction. These elements enhance the packagingâ€™s futuristic and technological appearance.",
