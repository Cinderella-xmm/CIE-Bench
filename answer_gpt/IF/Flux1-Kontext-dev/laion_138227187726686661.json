      "question": "Is the bedspread composed of multicolored LEGO-style blocks arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedspread features a colorful pattern with various sports balls and stars, fitting a sports theme. The design does not suggest LEGO-style blocks or pieces but instead looks like one cohesive fabric with printed patterns, typical of a children's sports-themed quilt. The colors and patterns mimic playful patchwork but are not constructed from physical LEGO blocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sports balls on the quilt represented by circular arrangements of LEGO-style tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sports balls on the quilt are depicted in a typical graphical or printed style without any 3D texture that would suggest LEGO-style tiles. They are flat illustrations that integrate into the quilt design, consistent with regular quilting techniques for children's bedding, lacking any indication of being composed of LEGO-style tiles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the pillow been replaced with a cube-shaped object constructed from stacked LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows are styled similarly to the quilt, featuring the same sports patterns. They maintain a typical pillow shape and show no indication of being made of stacked LEGO bricks. A cube-shaped object resembling LEGO bricks appears in the background on the bed, but this does not impact the pillow itself.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bed resting on a plain white surface with a visible LEGO baseplate texture (grid of raised studs)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bed with a smooth, plain white base and surface, devoid of any LEGO baseplate texture. The floor and surrounding area do not exhibit grids or raised studs typical of LEGO baseplates, indicating that the bed rests on a typical flat surface without any LEGO-like elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background of the image a smooth, uninterrupted white surface with no visible walls, windows, or furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is predominantly white, but not completely uninterrupted. While the bed occupies most of the image's focus, areas indicate the presence of pillows, decorative elements, and a cube on the bed suggesting a setup similar to a studio photograph. The environment has been simplified compared to a typical furnished room, but not to the exclusion of all elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bed frame or mattress appear to be constructed from LEGO bricks or styled to resemble LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No (unless explicitly stated; default assumption is only the baseplate is LEGO)",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the mattress and bed frame lack any visual cues suggesting construction from LEGO bricks or resembling LEGO materials. The design is smooth and resembles regular bed frames with typical bedding. There are no blocks or studs visible that would indicate a LEGO style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any non-LEGO objects such as a real soccer ball, lamp, or framed picture present in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present any distinct non-LEGO objects like a real soccer ball, lamp, or framed picture. Unlike Image A, which included such items, Image B focuses on a simplified depiction with bedding and a cube of LEGO bricks, eschewing these particular household objects present in Image A.",
