    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a flat postcard format rather than a 3D product shot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the item is displayed from a top-down view with no shadows or angles that suggest depth, making it appear flat. Furthermore, the presence of an envelope and the flat arrangement indicate that the item is intended to be viewed as a postcard, which supports a flat format. This contrasts with something that might have been presented in a 3D product shot where dimensionality and angles would likely be emphasized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the main features of the bag rendered in minimalist line art style with clean, simplified outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is depicted with clear and detailed visuals rather than simplified or minimalist line art. The material's texture, stitching, and metallic elements are retained, indicating that the image focuses on realism rather than a simplified art style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chevron pattern visually enhanced to appear raised or embossed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chevron pattern in Image B is composed of shading and highlights that give the impression of being raised or embossed, as one would expect from a quilted leather texture. This visual technique is used to add depth and suggest a tactile quality to the surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gold zippers depicted with a raised or embossed effect, distinct from the surrounding surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold zippers appear to have highlights and shading that create a sense of depth, making them appear raised and distinct from the surrounding material. This 3D effect provides a contrast against the flat surface of the postcard backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a muted olive tone palette without vibrant or contrasting colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The main color of the bag in Image B is a muted olive green. There are no vibrant or contrasting colors present, as the overall palette maintains a subdued tone consistent across the image, which creates a uniform visual theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image include a blank area on the back of the postcard suitable for writing messages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the front of a postcard with the purse depicted on it, and there is no visible blank area for writing messages. There is no explicit visual indication in the image of a backside where messages can be written.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the postcard displayed inside a sleek black portfolio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcard is placed against what looks like an envelope with a black exterior and an ivory interior. The layout and appearance suggest it functions more as an envelope than an entire portfolio.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the interior pages of the portfolio ivory in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interior surface that is visible in Image B, which appears to be the inside of an envelope flap, is ivory in color, contributing to a two-toned appearance with the black exterior, consistent with the style of envelopes designed for cards or postcards.",
