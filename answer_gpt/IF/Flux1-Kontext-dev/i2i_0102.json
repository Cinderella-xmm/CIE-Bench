      "question": "Is the word “Draft” written in a handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' appears in a stylized, cursive script, resembling handwriting with smooth curves and a flowing form typically associated with handwritten fonts. This observation combined with common knowledge of typographic styles indicates that the word 'Draft' is indeed presented in a handwritten-style font.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word “Draft” placed on the yellow paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the word 'Draft' directly on the surface of a yellow sheet, suggesting the placement of the text on the paper itself. Visual cues such as the spatial alignment and the interaction between the pencil and the paper reinforce the conclusion that the word is inscribed on the yellow paper.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image resemble a design sketch cover focused on presenting the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the word 'Draft' in a prominent manner, with a pencil seemingly interacting with it, which suggests a design-oriented scene. The stylized font and focused composition on the pencil and word 'Draft' imply that the image conveys the essence of a design sketch cover meant to highlight the creative concept of the word 'Draft'.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is rendered in bold black letters against a bright yellow background, making it easily discernible. The use of a clear font enhances legibility, ensuring that the word 'Draft' stands out and is readable without any obstructions or distortions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B includes additional elements such as a pencil touching the paper, part of a laptop in the background, and the surface that holds the paper. These components contribute to the setting of the image, which consists of more elements than just the yellow paper and the word 'Draft'.",
