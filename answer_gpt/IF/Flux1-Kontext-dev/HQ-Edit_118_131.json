      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the elephant teapot and base, enclosed within a curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the scene featuring the elephant teapot, cup, and base is visibly enclosed within a large glass dome. The dome has curved contours and serves as a protective cover for the items inside. This enclosure is immediately identifiable due to the glass reflection and the visible boundary that encapsulates the objects, suggesting that they are within a glass dome.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible gears and copper-colored accents added to the surface of the elephant teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant teapot does not display any gears or copper-colored accents on its surface. It maintains the metallic floral and animal design with an elephant motif, consistent with the unified silvery appearance seen throughout. Therefore, there are no additional mechanical elements or copper coloring added to the teapot's surface.",

      "question": "Does the base feature simulated wooden floorboards with scattered tea leaves and tiny silver utensils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the base appears to be designed to simulate a wooden texture, and scattered around it are recognizable tea leaves along with tiny silver utensils. These elements are clearly placed on the base, showcasing a deliberate design choice to feature such items in conjunction with the teapot and cup, suggesting a thematic arrangement related to tea preparation or service.",

      "question": "Are soft moss accents visibly embedded in the base area inside the glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the base, which supports the elephant teapot and cup, includes decorative soft moss accents around its edge. This green moss is visible and embedded along the perimeter, providing a natural and softened aesthetic that complements the scene under the glass dome.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed visible steam swirling outwards from the tip of the elephant's trunk. This is indicated by the white vapor trails that appear above the trunk, creating the impression of the teapot in use, possibly brewing tea.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B shows that there are no vine-like metalwork details surrounding the scene as part of the dome or base structure. Instead, the design elements involve moss and wood textures, without the presence of metal vines or similar structures.",
