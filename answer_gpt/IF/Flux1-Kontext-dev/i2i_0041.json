      "question": "Have the three sheep been converted into chibi characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted in a style consistent with chibi representations, characterized by their small size, large heads relative to body size, and simplified features. The original image A featured three sheep, which have been transformed in Image B into cute chibi-style illustrations. Chibi characters often exaggerate certain features to make them appear more adorable.",

      "question": "Do the chibi characters have scarves, earmuffs, and gloves added as winter accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, accessories such as scarves, earmuffs, and gloves can be seen on the chibi characters, likely added to emphasize a winter theme. These accessories are visible on each character, which typically wouldn't be present on the real sheep depicted in Image A. Such additions are common in character designs to indicate seasonality and enhance the aesthetic appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the interaction pose of the chibi characters by the railing been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are positioned facing each other, suggesting interaction. In the original, Image A, the sheep seem to be interacting with the fence, possibly eating or curiously investigating. The poses are altered in Image B, not directly replicating the interaction seen with the fence in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chibi characters depicted in a flat, cartoonish style with thick outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays characters with thick outlines and flat coloring, typical of cartoon styles, particularly in chibi representations. This contrasts with the natural photograph in Image A, which has depth and texture. Such a style is often used for stickers, comics, and illustrations due to its simplicity and clear visual impact.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of the image transparent for sticker use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be a simple, uniform color, not transparent. This is common in illustrations that are meant to be printed or digitally displayed but doesn't necessarily imply suitability for sticker use unless a transparent background is specifically provided.",
