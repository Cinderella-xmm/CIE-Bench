      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted in a cartoon style with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man appears to have been rendered with detailed attention to attire and background, fitting a more realistic style than a typical cartoon.

      "question": "Has the cane been replaced with a golden scepter featuring an ornate or regal design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man holds a cane, which appears wooden and unadorned rather than resembling a regal golden scepter with ornate design.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing colors are predominantly neutral and earth tones like beige and brown. While these colors can be soft, muted, and somewhat pastel-like, the overall palette is more grounded and classic rather than pastel-focused, which typically includes lighter shades like pinks, baby blues, and soft greens.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone path appears to have artistic elements, the stones have non-realistic, outlined edges giving them a stylized look rather than a completely realistic pattern. This artistic interpretation in Image B gives a non-realistic appearance.",
