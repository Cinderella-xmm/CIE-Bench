    "Question": "Q3: Is the 'Sumo Digital' logo rendered as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Sumo Digital' logo is depicted on the base of an award in a way that suggests embossing on wood, with a circular seal-like appearance and a wooden texture surrounding it.
