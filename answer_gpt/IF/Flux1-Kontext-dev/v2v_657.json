      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, it showcases a Funko Pop style box containing a scene where the figure is performing a trick on a skateboard. The perspective is isometric, allowing viewers to view the figure from a slightly raised angle common in such collectible box depictions. This type of perspective is typically used to give a three-dimensional feel while fitting within the box's aesthetic design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the box design in Image B, the word “SKATEBOARDER” is prominently displayed on the top section of the box in bold lettering, which is clearly intended to represent the theme or character depicted within.

      "question": "Is there a chibi-style figurine inside the box, accompanied by a skateboard, a helmet, jeans, and a black shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the box shown in Image B, there is no separate chibi-style figurine wearing a helmet. Instead, the box contains an illustration of a skater performing a skateboarding trick similar to the real-life scene outside. The skateboard is present, and the clothing elements such as jeans and a black shirt match, but there is no helmet involved, nor is there a separate chibi-style figure placed inside alongside the skater depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Next to the box depicted in Image B, there is a chibi-style figurine placed outside the box. The figure is dressed in a black shirt and jeans, resembling the character in the box illustration. However, this figurine maintains the characteristic simplified features of chibi-style art and doesn't focus on realism or intricate textures and lighting that would characterize a realistic depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall design of the box in Image B strongly adheres to the recognizable Funko Pop box style, characterized by its rectangular shape, clear display window, stylized character art on the side, and branding elements like logos and the character's title. This alignment with the Funko Pop box design conventions is evident, validating it as a designed collectible box consistent with that style.",
