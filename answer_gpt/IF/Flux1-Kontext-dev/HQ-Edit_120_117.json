    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire lighthouse scene enclosed within a spherical glass or transparent globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lighthouse scene encapsulated in a transparent spherical structure resembling a snow globe. The visual cue is the curved reflective surface surrounding the lighthouse, indicating the presence of a globe-like covering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lighthouse inside the globe depicted as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse appears to be part of a snow globe decoration. Common sense tells us snow globes typically house miniature scenes. The overall proportion of the lighthouse relative to the globe confirms it's a scale model within the globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves around the lighthouse inside the globe made of translucent blue resin with a stylized appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waves in Image B have an appearance suggesting a crafted or stylized element typical of decorative items within globes. They look more solid and defined than natural water, which suggests a resin material. The translucence and stylized shape further support this inference.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the globe rest on a wooden base with an engraved compass rose pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the globe placed on a round wooden base with carved or engraved markings. A closer look reveals a design resembling a compass rose, frequently used for decorative bases. The visual pattern and material match the description.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama visible in the background behind the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background outside the globe is a plain surface without additional elements like clouds or mountains. Instead, these elements are depicted within the globe, contributing to the inside scenery rather than the exterior backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the rocks inside the globe rendered in earthy tones (such as browns, tans, and greens) and the water in vibrant shades of blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the globe of Image B, the rocks have a brownish, earthy tone, and the water is depicted in vivid blues, which is a typical color palette for creating a natural yet visually appealing miniature environment.",
