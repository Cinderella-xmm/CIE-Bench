      "question": "Has the image been redesigned into a poster format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design changes are apparent with the presence of added text and a graphical layout that resembles a poster format. The original standalone composition of a spoon and plate is now integrated into a larger black background with text, which is a common characteristic of posters. The presence of enlarged and bold title text at the top and additional text formatting confirms this transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top section prominently displays the words 'MASTER CHEF' in large, bold white letters against a black background. This positioning and styling are typical for titles on posters, indicating that it is likely intended as the title. The use of uppercase letters further emphasizes its significance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the plate and spoon, there is text arranged in a circular fashion that reads 'FIAL TUUND'. This does not spell out 'Final Round', suggesting either a typographical choice or error. Considering the question about the subtitle 'Final Round', it is not accurately displayed in the image.",

      "question": "Does the poster include the plate and spoon from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image B to Image A, the central elements of the plate and spoon remain consistent. In Image B, these objects are still centrally positioned and occupy the same space against what is now a black background with additional text. The placement and objects themselves appear unchanged from Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the poster contain design elements (such as fonts, colors, or graphics) that enhance the cooking competition theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features design elements such as bold fonts and a stark black-and-white contrast that contribute to a professional and serious appearance, suitable for a competition theme. The use of large typography for 'MASTER CHEF' is indicative of a competitive cooking theme. However, beyond this text, there are no additional graphics or colors directly enhancing the cooking competition theme beyond the spoon and plate, which represent cooking in a subtle manner. Considering overall design elements focusing on the title, the answer leans towards the affirmative.",
