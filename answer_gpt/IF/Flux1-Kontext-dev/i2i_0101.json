        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the text 'flyaway' is visible below the painting. This text was not naturally part of the setting and appears to have been added intentionally to the image by analyzing the font and format typical in image editing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'flyaway' possesses characteristics often associated with handwritten fonts, such as variations in stroke width and a cursive style. These features indicate that the text 'flyaway' is styled in a handwritten manner.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the text 'flyaway' is aligned horizontally under the painting at the center of the sideboard. The text's proximity and alignment suggest it is directly below the painting without deviation to the side or further down the wall.",

The use of a handwritten font adds nostalgia and elegance, enhancing the postcard-like appeal of the edited scene.",
