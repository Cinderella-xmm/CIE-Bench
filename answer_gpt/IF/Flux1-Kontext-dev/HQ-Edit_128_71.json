        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the Statue of Liberty figures displays the typical verdigris patina, visible as a greenish-blue color. The other statue looks like it has a copper-hued patina, with reddish-brown coloration. These visual details indicate that both of these patinas are present on the statues.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background sky inside the glass jar is a clear and bright blue, not the soft pastel colors like pale pink, lavender, or mint green. The outer background of the jar is in pastel pink hues, but that is not part of the sky in the diorama.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
