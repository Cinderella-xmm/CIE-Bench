    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain multiple distinct postcard-style panels depicting the woman in different dynamic poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image appears to feature a single large image of a woman walking down a city street, surrounded by people and neon signs, rather than multiple postcard-like panels. Considering this visual information, the background context suggests no division into separate postcard panels, thus indicating that the image maintains a continuous scene without panel segmentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red dress and black leather jacket outlined with bold, thick lines and rendered in highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image B showcases a woman wearing a red dress and a black leather jacket. These garments appear to be presented in a realistic style without exaggerated or bold outlines common in illustrations, and the colors are vibrant but not distinctly saturated to the level seen in cartoon or comic art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there at least three different dynamic poses shown—such as walking, looking at neon signs, and browsing shop windows—in the postcard series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not depict multiple poses of the woman; instead, it presents her walking along a city street. Combining the concept of different poses with the visual data, the image lacks multiple representations of dynamic activities and maintains a singular scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire set of postcards presented within a black slipcase that has a silver foil embossed cityscape design on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays an image presented similar to a CD or DVD case open to reveal the city scene. There is no indication that the image is contained within a black slipcase with silver foil designs. The visual focus remains on the city street and the individuals within it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there comic-style visual elements such as panel borders, speech bubbles, or motion lines present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image B does not feature traditional comic-style elements like panel borders, speech bubbles, or motion lines. Instead, the visual style is coherent rather than segmented, with no overlay of graphic elements typically found in comics.",
