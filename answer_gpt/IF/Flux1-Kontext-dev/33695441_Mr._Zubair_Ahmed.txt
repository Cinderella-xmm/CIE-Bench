    "Question": "Q2: Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
    "explanation": "The steps in Image B are visually consistent with typical stairs, presenting a uniform, smooth surface usually associated with stone or concrete. They do not resemble segmented scales or any pattern that would be associated with reptilian skin. No transformation is evident that suggests a scale-like texture.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
    "explanation": "The wooden handrails visible in Image B are part of the usual design of a spiral staircase, featuring no skeletal framework or features that would liken them to a serpent's body. The wood grain and structure are typical for staircases, showing no transformation into organic or skeletal-like forms.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q6: Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",
    "explanation": "The spiral staircase in Image B maintains the typical construction of such architectural features, appearing as a precise and meticulously constructed element. While stairs naturally coil in a spiral form, there is no deliberate transformation to emphasize a serpent-like grace or fluidity beyond the expected design of the staircase.",
