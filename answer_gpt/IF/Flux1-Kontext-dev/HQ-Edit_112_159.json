    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the car and coastal road enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible edges and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and the coastal road are enclosed within a transparent container that resembles a glass display case. This is evident from the visible edges and reflections along the glass surfaces. The transparent nature of the case is inferred from the reflections and structure seen around the edges of the image, which suggests containment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car exhibit metallic red coloring with visible gradient hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B exhibits a shiny metallic red color that displays gradient hues across its surface. This is observed through the bright highlights and darker shades on the car's body, indicating varying light reflections typical of a metallic paint finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines present on the car’s bodywork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the car with distinct curves and sharp lines on its bodywork. The design includes aerodynamic features and detail lines that are typical in high-performance car designs, evident in the sharply defined edges and contours visible on the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road and cliffs do not exhibit characteristics of a layered resin construction. Instead, they appear more like a photographic representation rather than a crafted piece, lacking any visible stratification or depth that would imply resin layering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The road and cliff surfaces in Image B do not show any micro gravel textures embedded in them. The details visible are smooth and clean, focusing more on photorealism, without the inclusion of additional texture effects that would represent gravel.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case. The visible elements of the diorama include the car, the road, and the cliffs, but not a defined top panel with a sky illustration, implying the top boundary is transparent or open.",
