    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck has a glossy, highly reflective surface, characteristic of crystal or glass-like materials. It has a consistent green color throughout, resembling the appearance of emerald or jade. This appearance is due to the entire truck being made to look like it's crafted from a single continuous material with a polished finish that reflects light like crystal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels appear translucent and have a similar reflective quality as the rest of the truck. This translucent appearance suggests they are made from a material like quartz or another transparent crystal. However, specific internal crystalline patterns are difficult to discern due to the uniform color and the way transparency and reflections are rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the truck placed on a smooth, white marble platform?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is indeed placed on a base that has a polished, smooth surface with a white color and faint grey streaks typical of marble. This suggests that the base is made to resemble a white marble platform.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck has a smooth and glossy surface rather than distinct angular or faceted planes. While it reflects light, it does not have the appearance of faceted surfaces that would cause noticeable light refraction. The surface appears more polished and continuous like glass or crystal, not specifically angularly faceted.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?",
    "explanation": "When comparing Image A and Image B, the overall shape, proportions, and layout of the truck in Image B appear consistent with the original military truck in Image A. The cab, wheels, and boxy structure are similar, preserving the original truck's form despite the change in material and color.",
    "answer": "Yes"
