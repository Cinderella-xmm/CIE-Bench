    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the silhouetted boat and riders replaced by a mythical ocean guardian creature that is clearly distinguishable from a regular boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the form in the water does not resemble a regular boat and instead appears as a substantial creature emerging from the water. This entity has distinct features, such as a tree-like structure extending from it and being surrounded by glowing patterns, which differentiate it from the ordinary boat and riders seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the creature feature a shell-like body composed of sunset-colored hues (orange, red, yellow)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a body whose hues seem to match the sunset colors, including shades of orange, red, and yellow visible around the glowing areas, supporting the idea that it has sunset-colored features akin to a shell.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there coral-like spires visibly extending along the back of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are structures extending from the creature's back resembling spires. These are depicted in a manner similar to branches or coral formations, lending a fantastical element that supports the description of coral-like spires.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the riders been replaced with glowing, spirit-like figures that emit light and resemble sea guardians?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Instead of the original riders, Image B features glowing points, but they do not clearly represent figures or entities that resemble spirit-like figures or guardians. They are parts of the creature rather than distinct figures replacing the riders.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the water trail been replaced with glowing, wave-like patterns that match the color gradient of the sunset sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surrounding the creature is a glow forming wave-like patterns. This glow is distinct and does not match entirely with the color gradient of the sunset sky which consists of reds and oranges, since the trail is more blue and white.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The location of the mythical creature in Image B matches the position of the original boat from Image A. It is centrally located in the lower half of the image indicating a similarity in position between the two.",
