      "question": "Is there a squirrel present in the foreground of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a clear depiction of a squirrel prominently positioned in the lower left section of the painting. The animal is distinctly visible due to its detailed, realistic features and its placement in the foreground of the scene, which makes this element of wildlife unmistakable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel blend naturally with the painting's brushstrokes and color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The painting's background, based on Van Gogh's style, features distinct and bold brushstrokes with a swirling effect and a cohesive color palette. The squirrel in Image B, however, appears more detailed and realistic, with smoother textures than the surrounding elements. This creates a visual discrepancy between the animal and the Van Gogh-esque background, indicating the squirrel does not blend naturally.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the squirrel positioned in the foreground, closer to the viewer than other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B is notably placed at the forefront of the composition, standing out against the swirly brushstrokes of the sky and the village in the background. Its size and position within the frame indicate it is meant to be perceived as closer to the viewer compared to other distant features like the church spire or swirling sky.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the addition of the squirrel maintain the overall harmony and composition of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Van Gogh's original composition is characterized by its fluidity and blending of colors and shapes. The added squirrel, though positioned thoughtfully within the composition, breaks this harmony due to its more defined, realistic depiction and different texture, which contrasts with the painterly style of the rest of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the squirrel sized appropriately in relation to other elements in the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel's size in Image B appears proportionate given its foreground placement, which naturally makes foreground elements appear larger compared to those in the background. Its size does not seem exaggerated or diminished in relation to the house structures or trees, maintaining a realistic perspective.",
