      "question": "Is the edited image structured as a two-panel comic strip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows two distinct sections divided visually, which is typical of a two-panel comic strip format. The left side features a character and speech bubble, while the right side illustrates a different scene, common in comic panel storytelling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image feature bold outlines, vibrant colors, and exaggerated expressions typical of pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual elements in Image B include thick, bold outlines along with bright and contrasting colors, which are characteristic features of pop art style. Additionally, the characters and scenes are drawn with exaggerated expressions, emphasizing a cartoonish pop-art flair.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all donuts depicted with doughy limbs, expressive icing eyes, and sugar-crusted armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main donut character is personified with limbs and an expressive face indicative of 'icing eyes.' However, not all donuts have these attributes; they are primarily drawn as typical donut shapes, not with 'doughy limbs' or 'sugar-crusted armor'.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text “Guardians of the Plate, unite!” spoken by a donut character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Panel 1 of Image B actually contains the text 'GUARDIONSGS OF THE PLATE, UNIT!' which appears to be a misspelling or alteration of the intended phrase. The character depicted is a donut who seems to be giving a rousing speech.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 in Image B shows an illustration of a castle surrounded by donuts, but there is no coffee mug fortress, nor are there marshmallow spears or chocolate shields. The castle and donut crowding are representative elements but do not include the specified items.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text elements (e.g., speech bubbles) rendered in playful, cartoon-style fonts?",
      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements in Image B, including the speech bubbles and title, are designed in a playful and bold cartoon-like font that fits the comic strip's overall aesthetic, reinforcing its stylized, lively feel.",
