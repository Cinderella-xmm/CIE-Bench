      "question": "Does the elephant’s skin feature a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the elephant's skin appears in a deep blue hue, and the presence of glowing effects suggests a more celestial theme than the natural texture typically associated with an elephant's skin. However, there are no distinct galaxy-patterned textures featuring visible stars, nebulae, or cosmic swirls. The lighting and color effects play a role in creating an ethereal look but don't specifically manifest as a galaxy pattern. Thus, despite the visual enhancement, it does not have a galaxy-patterned texture.",

      "question": "Do the elephant’s tusks exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance with glowing, cloud-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the tusks of the elephant are enhanced with a bright bluish hue that gives them a glowing effect. The presence of this glow suggests an ethereal appearance, reminiscent of something otherworldly like a nebula. However, they do not display a complex, cloud-like texture or specific features of a nebula, but the glow itself does resemble a simplified nebula-like appearance.",

      "question": "Are the elephant’s ears replaced with vast, sail-like structures that reflect starry constellations and have a celestial appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the elephant's ears maintain their natural shape but are visually enhanced with an intense blue glow and have lightning-like streaks within them. This gives them a glowing, somewhat celestial appearance, but they are not replaced with different structures like sails, nor do they specifically reflect starry constellations. The changes maintain basic ear structures with additional visual effects.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the elephant’s trunk emit a visible, swirling cosmic mist composed of glowing particles or nebula-like vapor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the elephant's trunk itself does not emit any visible mist or particles. The focus on the image is primarily on the glow and enhancements of the elephant's skin and appendages, but there is no indication of an emitted mist from its trunk.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there radiant, glowing planetary rings encircling the elephant’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the legs of the elephant are enhanced with glowing blue accents that appear as swirling lines and points of light. These enhancements create an impression of energy and glow but do not specifically form encircling planetary rings around the legs. While suggestive of otherworldly energy, they don't match the description of radiant, encircling, planetary rings.",

      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet display luminescent star patterns that glow visibly against the skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the feet of the elephant exhibit bright blue glowing spots that could be likened to star patterns. These luminescent accents against the deep blue of the elephant's skin create a visible contrast, making them appear as glowing points, reminiscent of stars.",
