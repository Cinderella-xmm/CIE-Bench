    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a holographic projection screen added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly visible circular blue projection with circuits and lines emanating from the center, which visually resembles a digital or holographic display. Such features often characterize holographic projection screens, frequently depicted in sci-fi imagery.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection appear to emerge from the man's phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man in Image B is holding a smartphone, and the holographic projection seems to connect to or originate from this phone, suggesting a digital or augmented reality interface coming from the device.",

      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen display a city map interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The projection in Image B has a circular design with intricate lines and sections that resemble street layouts found on city maps. This gives the appearance of a schematic or map interface.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B and Image A besides the added holographic projection and the slight positioning or posture changes to accommodate the display, there do not appear to be any other unintended or noticeable alterations. The attire and general setting remain consistent with the original.",
