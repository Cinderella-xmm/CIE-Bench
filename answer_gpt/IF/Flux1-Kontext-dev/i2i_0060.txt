    "Question": "Q2: Is the steak spiral-rolled?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a piece of steak that appears as a single rectangular block, without any indications of being rolled or having a spiral shape. The visible texture of the meat is consistent throughout its surface, and there are no signs of a rolled appearance, such as layers or a circular pattern. This suggests that the steak is simply a solid piece rather than spiral-rolled.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the carrots cut into a fan-shape?",
    "explanation": "The carrots in Image B are cut into uniform rectangular strips and arranged in a curved pattern on the plate. Although they form an arc shape on the plate, these individual pieces are not cut into a fan shape; a fan shape would involve pieces having a wider base that tapers towards the end, which is not the case here. Thus, they are arranged in an arc, but not cut into a fan-shape.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Have sauce dots been added to each vegetable?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are sauce dots present on the plate, specifically near the quinoa and near the carrots. However, they are not added directly to each individual vegetable but seem to be placed strategically for aesthetic presentation. Not every vegetable has an accompanying sauce dot directly adjacent to it, making this a broader plating design rather than targeted application per vegetable.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the food served on a large white ceramic plate?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the food items are placed on a plate that is predominantly white, fitting the description of ceramic. Given the proportion between the food and the plate, the plate appears to be large, as it accommodates the food with plenty of space, typical for high-end plating to emphasize spacious arrangement and elegance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
