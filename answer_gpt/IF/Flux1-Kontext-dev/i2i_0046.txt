    "Question": "Q1: Does the image have a white border surrounding it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a white border is visibly present surrounding the entire image. This can be discerned by the clear contrast between the photo and the white frame, which is commonly associated with the look of polaroid photography. The presence and consistent width throughout the image are key visual cues to identify this border.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the caption “11:13 AM” visible at the bottom within the white border?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the caption '11:13 AM' is distinctly visible at the bottom within the white border. This addition is clearly intended to mimic a timestamp on polaroid images, a common stylistic feature. Moreover, the font style and positioning align with traditional timestamp aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the faded effect been applied to the entire image?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B for a faded effect, there is no visible evidence that suggests any fading has been applied across the image. The colors and contrasts in the image remain vivid and consistent with typical photographs, thus ruling out any fading modifications.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image have a paper-like grain texture applied to it?",
    "explanation": "Investigating Image B for a paper-like grain texture, there does not appear to be any overlay that mimics the tactile or visual experience of graininess found in textured paper. The image remains sharp with smooth transitions between colors, implying no such texture was added.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the original composition and elements of the image preserved, aside from the added white border, caption, faded effect, and grain texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, aside from the explicit additions such as the white border and the caption '11:13 AM', all original elements and composition of Image A are preserved including the skateboarder, background, and colors. As previously noted, faded effect and grain texture are not applied, maintaining the integrity of the original image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
