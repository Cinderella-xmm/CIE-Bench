      "question": "Have the giraffes' necks been exaggeratedly elongated in a whimsical caricature style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes' necks are elongated, but when examined closely, they maintain realistic proportions relative to their bodies, akin to their natural appearance. The style is cartoonish yet the proportions are consistent with what would be expected for a realistic giraffe. Therefore, the necks are not exaggeratedly elongated in a whimsical caricature style.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
