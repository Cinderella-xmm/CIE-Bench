      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the MK logo is present on the handbag itself and also as a pendant on the model's necklace rather than as a brooch on the clothing. The logo remains circular and gold, but its placement as a pendant differs from being attached to dress or jacket.",
