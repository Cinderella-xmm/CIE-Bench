    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a series of separate postcard-sized panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a single, complete, and integrated illustration rather than a series of separate postcard-sized panels. No division or separate frames suggest multiple panels. Thus, the presentation isn't as a series of panels.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the girl’s blouse feature intricate lace details rendered in a paper-cut style with sharp, layered edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse has lace details illustrated in a smooth, clean manner consistent with a printed illustration style, lacking sharp, layered paper-cut aesthetics. The details are neatly rendered, but do not mimic paper-cut style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the violin been enlarged in size relative to the girl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a violin proportionate to the girl's body, similar to typical violin sizes held by a person. Without analyzing Image A for comparison, the violin in Image B appears standard in size relative to the girl's body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the girl’s pose show an enhanced sense of musical expression through refined hand placement, posture, or facial focus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The girl's pose in Image B is artistically depicted holding the violin in a conventional manner. The overall illustration portrays her naturally rather than indicating an especially enhanced sense of musical expression compared to typical illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image have a visual appearance consistent with being printed on textured cream stock (e.g., warm off-white tone, soft matte finish)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a warm off-white tone and a soft, matte illustration style, consistent with illustrations designed to appear printed on textured cream stock. The paper-like background and tones reinforce this visual appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the back sides of the postcards illustrated with blank music sheet motifs suitable for writing notes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any postcard backs or any clear area that suggest blank music sheet motifs suitable for writing notes. The entire image focuses on the front illustration of the girl with a musical backdrop.",
