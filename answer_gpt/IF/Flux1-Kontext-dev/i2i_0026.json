      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features four distinct frames. Each frame depicts a part of a sequence that is typical for illustrating a progressive action like a tennis movement: preparing to hit, swinging the racket, making contact with the ball, and following through after the hit. The sequence of frames fits the description of these stages.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the illustration drawn in clean line art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration is composed of clear and distinct lines without any shading or coloring, representing objects and figures in a simplified, clean-lined manner. This is characteristic of line art, which emphasizes outlines and contours.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the illustration use monochrome color fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration does not incorporate any color fill; it relies solely on lines without any additional coloring. Monochrome color fill usually implies shades or tints of a single color, which is absent here.",

      "question": "Has the background been completely removed from the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration has only outlined figures with no background elements present, aside from the minor ground indications in some frames. This suggests a complete removal of any background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration is arranged in a 2x2 grid format rather than horizontal row, thus not forming a traditional horizontal instructional strip.",
