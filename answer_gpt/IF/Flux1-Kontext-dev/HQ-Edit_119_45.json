      "question": "Has the overall style of the sculpture been transformed into a steampunk aesthetic, featuring industrial elements like gears, copper, and brass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows characteristic steampunk elements, such as gears, pipes, and a retro-futuristic design, integrated into the sculpture. The presence of these elements suggests a transformation into a steampunk aesthetic. Copper and brass are dominant materials in steampunk designs, which are evident in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes of the headdress now composed of or replaced by intricate brass gears and polished copper elements, while preserving the original shape and silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the stripes of the headdress appear to remain as large simple blue and gold bands, without showing intricate brass gears or polished copper elements integrated into them. While the overall design elements of steampunk are present, the stripes themselves do not show these intricate mechanical changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure have mechanical wings attached to its back or shoulders, featuring visible gears, metal framework, and emerald-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show mechanical wings attached to the figure's back or shoulders. The steampunk adjustments are visible on the collar and lower sections, not as wings. Rapid reasoning deduces there is no addition of wings with gears or emerald accents evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the collar been redesigned with detailed clockwork patterns, including gears, cogs, or other mechanical components, replacing the original decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collar incorporates detailed steampunk elements typical of clockwork designs, evident in the gears and other mechanical components that can be observed. These replace the original decorative aspects, as seen in the elements added to the collar. The reasoning follows the assessment of visible patterns and designs indicating a clockwork style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small steam exhaust pipes visible on the collar, with subtle wisps of vapor or steam emanating from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observation of Image B reveals the presence of steam exhaust pipes with visible wisps of vapor. These features are typical in steampunk designs, supporting the narrative of subtle steampunk transformation, providing evidence of steam emanating from the pipes, supporting world-based knowledge assumptions about steampunk.",
