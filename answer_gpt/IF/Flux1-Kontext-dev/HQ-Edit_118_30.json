      "question": "Are the train cars depicted as large, colorful, interlocking blocks rather than realistic carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train cars appear realistic, maintaining their traditional carriage design and colors. The visual cues of typical railway carriages and their interconnected nature support this observation. Without referring to Image A, the edited image does not depict the train cars as interlocking blocks, thus maintaining a realistic appearance. ",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the train rendered as swirling white forms instead of a realistic cloud of steam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the train emitting smoke that resembles realistic steam as expected from a locomotive engine. The smoke appears as a cloud-like plume consistent with steam emissions. Based on the visual cues, it is not rendered as swirling forms but rather a natural steam cloud.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the countryside landscape been converted into various geometric patterns such as grids, polygons, or angular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countryside landscape is depicted with fields, hills, and natural elements that maintain their organic shapes. The fields are seen in typical agricultural plots, which can naturally appear rectangular due to farming practices, and are not overly stylized into unnatural geometric patterns. This landscape design corresponds to a conventional countryside view and not geometric conversions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with small puzzle pieces showing individuals in vintage clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the depiction of human figures in vintage clothing sitting and standing near the railway station. There are puzzle pieces below the main puzzle board, but these do not replace the human figures in the puzzle itself. The figures remain intact within the scene.",

      "question": "Is the entire puzzle scene placed on a light-colored wooden tabletop with visible grain and edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle scene is indeed placed on a surface that appears light-colored wood with visible grain and edges. The tabletop serves as the background for the puzzle board, and its texture and color are typical of wooden materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible interlocking edges, seams, or puzzle-piece borders throughout the scene indicating a complex, assembled structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces visible outside the main scene imply the assembled nature of the puzzle board. However, the central image itself is not fragmented by seams or borders indicating interlocking edges, suggesting the puzzle scene is intact and unified once completed. The outer puzzle pieces do show interlocking edges typical of puzzles.",
