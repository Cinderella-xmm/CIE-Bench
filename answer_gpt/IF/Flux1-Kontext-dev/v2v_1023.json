      "question": "Are the friends depicted as playful, chibi-style 3D characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the friends are not depicted as chibi-style 3D characters; instead, they appear as real individuals inside the snow globe. The visual information presented shows them sitting together closely, with normal human proportions and realistic textures, which differs from the exaggerated, stylized features of chibi characters. The chibi-style figures depicted inside the snow globe appear more as additional elements or decorations rather than representing the friends themselves.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the friends holding game controllers in their hands, and this setup is preserved within the snow globe. The controllers are clearly visible and look similar to typical gaming devices, which suggests they are engaging in a group gaming activity inside the globe.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a snow globe positioned on a table within what appears to be a cozy, inviting living room setting. The presence of ambient lighting, a potted plant, and furniture such as a lamp and table contributes to creating a warm atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop exhibits a softly glowing, amber-toned quality, as demonstrated by the warm lighting and shadows, especially reflected by the lamp. This lighting setup creates an inviting and gentle illumination throughout the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sparkling effect within and around the snow globe, but these sparkles appear to be artificially generated light effects contained within the globe instead of sunlight streaming through glass. They are not visibly streaming sunlight but rather a part of the snow globe's internal shimmering decoration.",

However, it does not display tiny pieces of furniture or specific seasonal decorations such as miniature snowflakes or other intricate details surrounding the characters.",
