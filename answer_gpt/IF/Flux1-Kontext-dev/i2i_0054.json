        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears as a uniform, solid gray with no texture or pattern, suggesting a matte finish.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, there is a visible shadow cast on the ground near the elephant's feet. This shadow suggests a light source from above, creating a natural look that contributes to the realistic representation of the elephant.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's an object resembling a D-shaped metal piece next to the elephant's foot. The shape and subtle shadows help highlight the curves, making it recognizable. Utilizing clear edges and shading techniques, the form is highlighted effectively against the gray background, thus drawing appropriate attention to its shape.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the elephant with a sparse background and minimal additional components. The solid gray background and absence of extraneous objects or distractions save for the elephant and its shadow indicate a minimalistic design approach. This design focuses the viewer’s attention solely on the main subject, aligning with minimalism's core principles.",

The limited color palette, absence of unnecessary decor, and emphasize on subject clarity make it a strong candidate for a minimalistic asset by focusing on the subject (the elephant) without distracting elements.",
