      "question": "Are there swirling cloud-like structures integrated into the tower's form or surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible swirling patterns that resemble cloud-like structures around the edges of the tower. These structures are light and airy, giving the appearance of being made of vapor or mist. This observation, combined with common imagery of swirling clouds in artistic depictions, leads to the conclusion that these are indeed cloud-like structures integrated into the tower.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there glowing runes visible along the wooden surfaces of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the tower with a distinctly blue hue, and upon inspection, there are no visible symbols or characters that resemble glowing runes on the wooden surfaces. It appears more like a uniform lighting effect rather than discrete rune shapes. Hence, in this image, no individual glowing runes can be identified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the roof been replaced with shimmering crystal spires instead of wooden or thatched material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower roof appears to have been modified to a shimmering blue structure, which could be interpreted as crystalline due to its smooth and reflective appearance. This differs from traditional wooden or thatched roofs, suggesting a transformation into a crystalline form. Thus, based on the evidence, the roof does resemble crystal spires.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing orbs located at the top of each spire on the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any distinguishing luminous orbs at the tips of the spires. The tops of the spires have a consistent design and color without distinct orb-like features. Therefore, there are no glowing orbs present.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have all trees in the scene been transformed into silver spiral shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees surrounding the tower remain visually consistent with traditional tree shapes and are not depicted as silver spirals. The trees have retained their foliated look, typical of coniferous trees. Therefore, they have not been transformed into spiral shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there translucent, ghost-like birds circling the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show a flock of birds flying around the tower. However, in Image B, the birds do not appear to be translucent or ghost-like; they retain a solid form, similar to the typical depiction of birds in flight. Thus, they are not ghost-like in appearance.",
