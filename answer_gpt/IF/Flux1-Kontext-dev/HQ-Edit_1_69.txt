    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain multiple distinct postcard-style panels depicting the woman in different dynamic poses?",
    "explanation": "The edited image appears to feature a single large image of a woman walking down a city street, surrounded by people and neon signs, rather than multiple postcard-like panels. Considering this visual information, the background context suggests no division into separate postcard panels, thus indicating that the image maintains a continuous scene without panel segmentation.",

    "explanation": "The image B showcases a woman wearing a red dress and a black leather jacket.

    "Question": "Q3: Are there at least three different dynamic poses shown—such as walking, looking at neon signs, and browsing shop windows—in the postcard series?",
