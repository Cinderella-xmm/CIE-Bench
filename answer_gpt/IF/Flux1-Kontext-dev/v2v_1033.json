      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the box has a light, creamy color that fits the description of pastel color, and the presence of golden elements around the box suggests delicate trims. The light and intricate golden embellishments reinforce this assessment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals the bee with clear, shiny yellow and black stripes, reflecting light and offering a glossy finish. However, the wings do not seem to be semi-translucent but rather opaque with a solid color finish, which does not match the sparkling, semi-translucent wings description.",
