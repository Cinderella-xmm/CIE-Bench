      "question": "Does the image have a white border frame surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear white border surrounding the image. The border is even and provides a frame-like appearance, which is commonly seen in photographs that have been edited to resemble printed pictures. This observation is made by directly looking at the visual cues in Image B, without needing to refer to Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a handwritten caption at the bottom of the image that reads “Banana Cream Dream 2024”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation of Image B, the bottom part of the image clearly shows text that reads “Banana Cream Dream 2024.” The font and style of the text resemble handwriting, which gives the impression of a personal or custom label often associated with Polaroid or vintage photographs, enhancing its personalized look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit a light brown vintage filter that gives the appearance of a film-style photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a light brown or sepia tone that covers the entire image, including the plate, dessert, and surroundings. This is consistent with vintage filters used to simulate old film photographs, where colors are made warmer and more muted. This stylistic choice is evident from the change in brightness and color saturation when observing Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the image presented in a Polaroid style with the combination of the white border frame and vintage filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines the white border and the vintage filter elements effectively, resembling the aesthetic similar to a Polaroid photograph. A Polaroid photo often includes both these features: a border that frames the picture and a color tone that gives a nostalgic look, as seen in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the original dessert appearance been preserved without any changes apart from the added frame, caption, and filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image A and Image B, the dessert itself, including its arrangement and appearance, remains unchanged. The edits made involve the addition of the border, caption, and filter, without altering the content or composition of the dessert and plate visible. This conclusion is drawn by closely examining Image A for content consistency in Image B.",
