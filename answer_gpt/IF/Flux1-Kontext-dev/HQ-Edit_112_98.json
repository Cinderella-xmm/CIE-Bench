      "question": "Has the sparrow been transformed into an ethereal blossom spirit with a non-realistic, floral appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has been altered to exhibit an otherworldly, enchanted aesthetic. The vibrant pink hues and floral motifs suggest a transformation into something more spirit-like, contrasting with the realistic depiction of a sparrow in Image A. The transformation is emphasized by the non-realistic enhancements and visual themes consistent with a blossom spirit.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bird's feathers replaced with petal-like structures that have a soft pink gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feathers of the bird in Image B appear as petal-like, with a soft pink gradient that suggests an integration of floral imagery into its plumage, differing from the true feather texture of Image A. This artistic manipulation indicates a deliberate effort to mimic the appearance of flower petals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features designs along the bird's wings that resemble floral patterns, enhancing its ethereal quality. These patterns are visible and differ from the natural feather patterns seen in Image A, aligning well with the notion of converting feathers to floral motifs.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the bird in Image B has been artistically modified to resemble a cascade of cherry blossoms, instead of the more conventional tail feathers seen in Image A. This transformation supports the floral aesthetic and spirit-like quality given to the bird.",
