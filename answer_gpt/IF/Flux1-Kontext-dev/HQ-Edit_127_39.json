    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the Eiffel Tower as a sentient, humanoid-like cybernetic sorceress with a distinct form suggesting consciousness and magic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower has been creatively transformed into a figure with a humanoid form, incorporating elements that resemble a cybernetic sorceress. This transformation is suggested by the presence of a cloak-like covering over the structure, the inclusion of glowing elements and symbols, and the posture which mimics that of a standing figure. These features collectively imply a suggestion of consciousness and magic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the original spire of the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a glowing energy crown at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the Eiffel Tower is no longer the original spire seen in Image A. Instead, it appears to be replaced by a glowing crown-like structure, characterized by electric or energetic visual elements that suggest it's made of energy rather than solid material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are intricate digital glyphs visibly engraved or illuminated on the structural girders of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structural elements of the Eiffel Tower are decorated with glowing lines and patterns that resemble digital glyphs or illuminated engravings. These intricate designs are not present in Image A, where the girders retain their typical non-illuminated iron appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible holographic elements animating the structure, such as floating light projections or shimmering visual effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is surrounded by visual effects that resemble holographic projections, including floating light elements and shimmering energy fields, none of which appear in the original Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a pixelated energy barrier surrounding the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a circular energy barrier with pixelated effects is visible around the base of what used to be the Eiffel Tower. This barrier appears to be made of light and energy, suggesting an advanced or digital tech appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two distinct, glowing digital eyes visible on the structure, emitting vibrant light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although there are glowing elements and designs, they do not include two distinct, glowing eyes. The structure has been transformed to resemble a figure, but the face is blurred out, and no specific eye-like features emitting light are visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the structure retain the iron lattice design, now styled as a flowing cloak-like covering over the sorceress form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower's classic iron lattice design has been altered to resemble parts of a flowing outfit, such as a cloak, draping over the figure shaped like a sorceress. This reinterpretation of the structure into a costume-like design aligns with the cybernetic sorceress theme.",
