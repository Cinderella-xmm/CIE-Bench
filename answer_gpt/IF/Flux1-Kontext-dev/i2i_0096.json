      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image show a left-side 90-degree view of the sofa alongside the front view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the view presented is exclusively a straight head-on perspective of the sofa and not a composite of multiple angles. World knowledge and visual cues from the image, such as the consistent alignment of the sofa's cushions and design, indicate its singular orientation directly facing the viewer. There is no evidence of a side view being depicted simultaneously.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dimensions of the sofa consistent between the front and left-side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not showcase a combined front and side view but exclusively a front view, a dimension consistency analysis between these two perspectives is not applicable. World knowledge regarding image perspective further confirms that dimensions would appear uniform in a single-view presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the front and side views of the sofa smooth and coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's only a straightforward frontal view of the sofa without any depiction of a transition to a side view. Utilizing the knowledge of perspective in photography and observation of visual cues confirms the continuation of a single-view orientation without any angle transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the sofa consistent in both the front and side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exclusively shows a front view of the sofa without accompanying side views, which implies consistent lighting across the frontal aspect. World knowledge about light behavior, such as shadows forming due to a single light source from the left, reinforces the uniform lighting across what is visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do objects around the sofa (e.g., wall art) appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the combined view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall art above the sofa is correctly scaled and centered relative to the sofa's frontal presentation. Given the single view nature of the composition, world knowledge on symmetry and proportion helps deduce that positioning and scale are appropriately accounted for in the imagery.",
