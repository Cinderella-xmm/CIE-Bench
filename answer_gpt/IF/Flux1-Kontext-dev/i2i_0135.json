      "question": "Does the right-side skier cast a shadow that suggests depth and closeness to the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the shadow cast by the right-side skier on the snow. The shadow is elongated and distinct, suggesting a close proximity to the snowy surface, which can be indicative of depth and dimensionality. This shadow effect is typical in scenarios where an object or person is depicted as closer to the light source and the surface, creating a sense of depth.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, inspect the area surrounding the right-side skier, particularly along the skis and the snow being disturbed. The snow flurries and slight blurring of motion near the skis and the skier's body are visually indicative of speed and movement. These effects are added to simulate the dynamic motion of skiing, where snow and air are displaced rapidly.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examine the positioning of the right-side skier relative to other objects and the landscape. The skier is quite prominent and positioned towards the foreground compared to the other elements in the scene, such as the distant mountains and trailing skier. This positioning gives an impression of closeness and prominence in the composition of the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the posture and angle of the right-side skier. The skier is angled forward, a common skiing posture, which is accentuated by the skier's leaning stance. This body positioning suggests an active movement toward the viewer and aligns with the skiing motion down a slope, enhancing the perception of closeness and engagement.",
