    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the tagine been transformed into a genie lamp shape with a bulbous body and a narrow neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tagine retains its original shape with a conical top and a round base and does not exhibit characteristics typical of a genie lamp, such as a distinct bulbous body or a narrow neck, which distinguishes genie lamps from tagines. This evaluation is based on common knowledge of the physical aspects of both objects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the top of the tagine been extended into a graceful spout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the top of the tagine remains as a short, stubby pinnacle, characteristic of traditional tagines, without any extensions or spout-like features. This indicates no transformation into a spout-like shape has occurred.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Have the geometric patterns been replaced with swirling, magical script-like engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric patterns on the tagine in Image B remain unchanged from the traditional patterns seen in Image A, with no evidence of transformation into swirling or script-like engravings, reflecting the artistic and decorative nature rather than mystical symbols.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottom of the tagine is enveloped in ethereal smoke-like elements, seeming to integrate with the tagine, suggesting a transformation into a more mystical representation. This visual change indicates a fantastical modification.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a depiction of ethereal smoke and floating orbs, there are no clear visual cues or outlines suggesting the presence of creatures emerging from the smoke, which would typically be more recognizable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features multiple floating orbs near the tagine, diverging from the stationary ingredients like lemons and herbs in Image A, suggesting a transformation connected to mystical themes and replacing physical ingredients.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the floating orbs glow with colors corresponding to elemental enchantments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orbs in Image B are depicted with varied glowing colors, like blue and purple, hinting at elemental or mystical properties often associated with enchantments. This creative use of color invokes the imagery of magical elements.",
