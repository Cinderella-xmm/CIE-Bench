    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible logo placed on the handle of the hammer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer placed on the workbench has a round section near its head where a logo is visibly emblazoned. The logo is clear and contrasts against the background of the hammer handle. Observing this placement and design, it indicates intentional branding on the tool.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there elegant, readable typographic elements displayed directly on the wood shavings scattered across the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the wood shavings appear to be purely functional and unadorned with any text. They are natural, irregular curls of wood typical of a workshop setting without any added typographic elements superimposed on them, indicating these are merely wood shavings without text.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal rustic textured banner positioned at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a pegboard with tools, with a wooden strip running horizontally at the top. However, this strip seems decorative and functional rather than serving as a banner. The texture matches wood commonly found in workshops and lacks the characteristics of a banner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pegboard in grayscale with visible copper-colored accents on tools or hardware?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the pegboard's color appears to be a neutral gray or black, which might be interpreted as grayscale. There are also copper-colored accents, such as the nails or hardware on the pegboard. These details suggest that the conditions of the question are met in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a sleek, minimalist business card visible behind the tools on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a business card located on the pegboard behind the tools. The card features a clean design with identifiable text and a logo, embodying a minimalist aesthetic which suggests sleekness as required by the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all original tools visible and retained in their original positions on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the positions and visibility of tools in Image A and Image B, the majority of tools appear to occupy the same positions. However, slight alterations or repositioning may exist to accommodate new elements like the business card or logo. The question of whether all tools remain unchanged requires acknowledging these potential shifts.",
