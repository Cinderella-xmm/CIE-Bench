      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure appears somewhat simplified and stylized rather than featuring precise proportions and intricate fur details. The fur lacks texture and detailing, suggesting a more smooth and artificial representation possibly akin to a toy or figure. This hints at the intended representation not being lifelike. Based on this observation and understanding of toy design, the choice would be 'No'.",

      "question": "Does the bear figure have emotive eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure's eyes are obscured by the blurring effect, making it impossible to determine the presence of expressive or emotive eyes. Without being able to see the eyes, we conclude that we can't affirm the presence of emotive eyes. The choice here is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the bear figure placed on a desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B where the bear figure is placed appears to be a desk or table. The presence of office-like elements such as a backpack, laptop, and plant further corroborates a desk setting. Common knowledge about interior setups allows for identifying this as a typical desk arrangement. The choice would be 'Yes'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a realistic, scaled-down model of the backpack included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backpack in Image B appears to be proportionate to the setting but not indicative of being a scaled-down model due to the lack of comparative context showing unusual scaling. Without definitive cues that it is reduced in size, aside from potential context like the bear figure which also might be atypically sized, it does not suggest minification clearly. The choice would be 'No'.",

      "question": "Does the scene have a casual, natural vibe, as if captured using a smartphone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's setting appears more artificial and staged, with objects arranged in a controlled environment typical of a studio or display setup. This kind of arrangement lacks the spontaneity associated with casual photography or a smartphone camera's natural capture. Studio-like attributes, seen in tidy organization and smooth surfaces, lead to a 'No' choice.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bear figure seamlessly combine lifelike textures with distinctive Japanese anime-style elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure is consistent with a simplified, cartoon-like aesthetic, lacking realistic textures like fur. Japanese anime-style elements are often characterized by more intricate design features and distinct stylistic flourishes, which aren't prevalent here. Thus, it doesn't reflect a blend of lifelike and anime-style visuals. The choice is 'No'.",
