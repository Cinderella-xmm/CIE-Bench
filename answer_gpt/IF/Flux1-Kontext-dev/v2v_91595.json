      "question": "Does the lens mount area feature a large, intricate mechanical eye with glowing amber irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the lens mount area lacks any mechanical eye or glowing elements. It maintains its appearance as a standard lens mount, consistent with a camera's structure. Without any visual cues suggesting the presence of a mechanical eye, the answer is based on the analysis of the existing visual structure.",

      "question": "Are there delicate articulated copper feathers sprouting from the textured black casing of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, there are no copper feathers seen sprouting from the camera's textured black casing. Based on the visual inspection, the camera casing remains unchanged in terms of added metallic or feather-like elements. This conclusion is reached by observing the consistent appearance of the camera's casing, typical of its original make.",

      "question": "Does the open battery compartment reveal a complex array of tiny, whirring gears and springs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the battery compartment with visible gears and springs, resembling clockwork components. These additions replace the usual battery details and suggest a mechanical theme integrated into the battery space. This analysis stems from the visual complexity observed in the area described.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the new elements, such as the mechanical eye, copper feathers, and gears, appear seamlessly integrated with the camera's original form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gears in the battery compartment appear visually integrated into the image without awkward transitions or mismatched colors. However, since there are no copper feathers or mechanical eyes added, only some of the described elements can be judged for integration. The existing added elements, like the gears, are indeed seamlessly integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate elements suggestive of a majestic clockwork owl, melded with the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a visually distinct clockwork owl with features such as a mechanical appearance and intricate design is visible near the battery compartment. This addition is characterized by a central owl motif with clockwork elements, including gears and an owl design, suggesting a blend of such themes with the camera's body.",
