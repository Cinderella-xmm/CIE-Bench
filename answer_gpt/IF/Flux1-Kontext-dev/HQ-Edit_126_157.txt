    "Question": "Q1: Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",
    "explanation": "The second image depicts the scene within a box-like structure that has the appearance of a frame made from wood. The edges and texture resemble that of polished wood, suggesting that the image is set within a wooden frame. Therefore, based on visual information, the image is enclosed in a wooden frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears to maintain its depth and realistic integration of elements. The boat, water, and hills are not separated or presented as layered cutouts but are part of a continuous and cohesive scene. This continuity suggests a single photographic composition rather than layered elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The boat in the second image shows detailed textures typical of aged wood, including visible wood grain and slight cracking. These are common indicators of weathered surfaces found in aged wood, adding to the realism of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
    "explanation": "The hills in Image B are depicted in soft pastel hues, primarily blue, that provide a more artistic gradient effect contrasted against realistic rendering often expected in natural scenery, which typically shows green or gray. This stylized rendering gives the image an ethereal and serene look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
    "explanation": "The water in Image B is presented with a smooth surface that reflects the surrounding environment calmly. There are no visible droplet-like etchings or additional textures suggesting a separate transparent layer that would mimic ripples.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene's composition creates depth primarily through perspective and atmospheric effects rather than visibly distinct physical separations between the elements. The boat, water, and hills transition smoothly, suggesting a continuous scene instead of separate layers.",
    "answer": "No"
