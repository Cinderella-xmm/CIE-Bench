      "question": "Does the entire image show characteristics of Ukiyo-e style, with flat colors and clear lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is distinguished by its flat color application and the use of clear, bold outlines that define the shapes within the artwork, a hallmark of the Ukiyo-e style. The visual appearance reflects the classical features associated with this Japanese art form, where depth and shading are minimized in favor of distinct line work and simplified color blocks.",

      "question": "Are there visible traditional Japanese painting brush strokes on the baseball bat and grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual effect on both the baseball bats and the grass suggests the artistic liberty typical of traditional Japanese paintings, although brush strokes themselves are not explicitly depicted. Instead, the texture and style convey the sense of painted elements, consistent with the Ukiyo-e technique that focuses on stylization over realistic detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the shapes of the baseball bats and grass been maintained while adapting to the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison between Image A and Image B indicates that the fundamental shapes of the baseball bats and grass remain recognizable in the edited image. While Image B uses stylistic techniques typical of Ukiyo-e, such as simplification and outlines, these adaptations do not alter the overall forms of the bats or the grass, maintaining their identifiable characteristics.",

      "question": "Has the grass been rendered with traditional Japanese brush strokes to reflect the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an adaptation that suggests traditional Japanese brush strokes on the grass. The stylized depiction includes the flattened texture and prominent outlines, contributing to an appearance aligned with Ukiyo-e aesthetic practices, which emphasize stylization over realistic portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the baseball bat display traditional Japanese brush strokes, adhering to the Ukiyo-e style requirements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the baseball bats accords with the flattened, stylized appearance typical of Ukiyo-e art. While brush strokes aren't directly visible, the outlined forms and simplified textures allude to traditional techniques found in Japanese Ukiyo-e paintings, where aesthetic harmony takes priority over the explicit texture details.",
