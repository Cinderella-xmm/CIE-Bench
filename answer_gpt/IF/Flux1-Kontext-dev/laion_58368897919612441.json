    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the historic fortress enclosed within a transparent dome structure resembling a terrarium?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is encapsulated within a clear, dome-shaped structure that visually resembles a terrarium. This analysis is based entirely on the observation of the glass dome surrounding the fortress, which common knowledge suggests is characteristic of a terrarium-like presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the grassy terrain been replaced with a dense, textured layer of lush moss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terrain around the fortress appears to be more consistent with a smooth, plush surface that is typical of moss. This texture suggests lush moss rather than standard grassy terrain, based on the way the surface looks smooth and verdant.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale model knights positioned on or around the terrain within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are miniature figures present on the terrain resembling knights. These figures are identifiable due to their small size and posture, combined with common knowledge regarding miniature dioramas, which often include such figures for realism and decoration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible faux stone pathways integrated into the moss-covered terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there appears to be a defined pathway on the terrain which resembles a stone path by its structure and layout. This kind of pathway is typically found in dioramas and is contrasted with the lush mossy texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the top of the fortress feature a delicate glass star instead of the original weather vane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the dome structure is adorned with a glass star, a notable change from the weather vane present on the fortress itself in Image A. The glass star is a decorative element often seen in terrarium designs, rather than a functional component like a weather vane.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the terrarium resting on a wooden stand with intricate carvings and a finish that suggests a vintage quality. This observation, combining the visual cues and common understanding of ornate woodwork, confirms the presence of a vintage-style stand.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the historical fortress, botanical elements, and miniature figures coexist in a unified, fantastical diorama style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B portrays a cohesive scene where the historic fortress, lush terrain, and small knight figures are integrated within a glass dome, forming a compact and imaginative diorama. This arrangement, combined with world knowledge about dioramas, speaks to a fantastical and unified style presentation.",
