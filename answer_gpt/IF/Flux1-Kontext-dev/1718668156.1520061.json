      "question": "Is the tall ice tower in the foreground rendered with pixelated textures and visible circuit-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall ice tower is visually represented with a distinct digital transformation. The appearance suggests that it has been given a futuristic look, characterized by the inclusion of glowing blue neon lines. While there may be a digital or electronic theme present, the direct description of pixelated textures and circuit-like patterns is not clearly visible. The glow and transformation give it a modernized appearance but do not explicitly display pixelation or circuitry.",

      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House represented using glowing neon lines instead of solid surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House is depicted with a distinct outline that emits a blue neon glow. This style replaces the usual solid surfaces with vibrant lines, giving it a stylized, futuristic interpretation, akin to neon sign artwork. This is a clear deviation from the original solid architecture, as seen in traditional representations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves in the ocean composed of geometric shapes rather than realistic water ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the water is depicted using pattern-like lines, which give the appearance of geometric shapes rather than natural water ripples. This representation aligns with a digital or stylized aesthetic, transforming the organic nature of water ripples into a more abstract and geometric form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the drink on the left appear as a transparent, floating hologram with visible depth and light distortion effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drink on the left is depicted with an enhanced glowing effect, and its inner structures appear to have been detailed with electronic-like patterns. Although it exhibits digital stylization, it retains a solid form and does not fully adopt the transparency or floating characteristics of a hologram. Thus, although stylized, it does not fully mimic the properties of a hologram.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a unified futuristic digital aesthetic, with all elements (ice tower, Opera House, ocean, drink) transformed according to their specified styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene showcases a cohesive transformation into a futuristic digital aesthetic. Every element, from the drink to the ice tower, the Opera House, and the ocean, has been rendered with blue neon luminous effects and stylized lines. The artistic choice presents a unified digital-themed reinterpretation, producing a consistent visual style across all elements in the scene.",
