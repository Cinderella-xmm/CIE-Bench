      "question": "Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces form an outline shaped like the map of the United States with small alterations related to human limbs protruding from the top portion of the map. The added arm and blurred head in Image B do not consist of sushi pieces; therefore, the sushi alone does not form a clear figure of a person.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible human arm added above the sushi map where the northeastern United States would be. The position suggests the arm is lifted upwards.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no separate left arm visible. Only one right arm is depicted above the sushi display reaching over the map area, which displays all the features of an arm, but no additional arm suggests left arm placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces outline the map of the United States and do not feature any elements that tend to symbolize or represent legs. No visual cues indicate separate formations resembling human legs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head of the person figure represented by sushi pieces and distinguishable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a blurred portion above the sushi map area, representing the head, but it is not composed of sushi pieces. Thus, the sushi does not represent nor distinguish the head clearly with its pieces.",
