    "Question": "Q1: Is the warrior statue composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with visible brick-like elements forming its body, limbs, and head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is clearly composed of LEGO bricks. The visible elements include the distinct brick-like patterns on the limbs, body, and head, common to LEGO constructions. The smooth, shiny surfaces with interlocking components are characteristic of LEGO materials. World knowledge of LEGO toys confirms this analysis.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the primary colors used in the statue limited to shades of brown and tan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the primary colors of the statue are brown and tan, with elements like the armor and headdress. However, the limbs of the statue display bright yellow, a typical coloring for some LEGO figures. This indicates that while brown and tan are common, they aren't the only colors used.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the armor sections (such as chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards) made of smooth LEGO bricks without surface texture?",
    "explanation": "The armor sections in Image B appear to be constructed from smooth LEGO bricks. The surfaces of these components lack intricate texture or patterns and instead have the typical shiny smoothness of LEGO bricks. This characteristic separates LEGO bricks from textured elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental details such as the headdress, necklace, and carvings on the torso created using textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the components are LEGO bricks, they do not exhibit visible patterns or textures unique to carved elements. LEGO constructions tend to have a smooth uniform surface without intricate designs seen in traditional ornamental carvings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue positioned on a plain white pedestal with no decorative elements, located in a gallery environment with framed artworks on the walls and track lighting overhead?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO statue placed on a plain white pedestal, suitable for displaying art objects. Unlike Image A, there is no gallery setting with artworks and track lighting visible. Therefore, it does not satisfy the conditions of a gallery environment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the LEGO statue retain the same standing posture, facial expression, and proportional dimensions as the original wooden warrior?",
    "explanation": "Image B reflects the same standing posture and proportional dimensions as seen in Image A. However, LEGO statues differ in rendering facial expressions due to the block-like face design; thus, it is impossible to retain the original's expressions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the statue visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, with no continuous surfaces resembling carved wood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire statue displays interlocking LEGO bricks characteristic of LEGO construction methods. The surfaces are distinctly formed by these bricks, contrasting with carvings of wood or other traditional materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
