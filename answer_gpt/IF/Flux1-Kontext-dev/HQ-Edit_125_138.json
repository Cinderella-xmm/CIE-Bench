      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Bali's Majestic Legacy' is prominently displayed at the top center of the image. The text is large and bold, making it easily noticeable.

      "question": "Does the dancer's dress feature intricate golden batik patterns and vibrant red colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted wearing a dress with detailed patterns that resemble traditional batik designs. The colors are primarily vibrant red with golden accents, which is consistent with traditional Balinese attire known for its rich and intricate designs. Based on these visual cues, the dress indeed features such patterns and colors.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the temple rendered in a line-drawn style using sepia tones instead of realistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the temple in a monochromatic, line-drawing style, primarily with sepia tones. This contrasts with Image A, which presents the temple in full realistic colors. The sepia tone gives the image a stylized, classic illustration look, differentiating it from realistic depictions.",

    {

      "question": "Is the temple centered in the composition, with the mythical creatures placed symmetrically on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the temple is positioned at the center of the composition, with two mythical creatures placed symmetrically on each side. This arrangement creates a balanced and harmonious composition, a common practice in traditional art and architecture to emphasize central figures. Just like in Image A, even though the style differs in rendering, the spatial arrangement remains the same.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there blocks of informative text about Balinese dance and architecture written in elegant serif fonts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B features blocks of text, upon inspection, these do not contain coherent or informative content about Balinese dance and architecture. The text appears to be placeholder or gibberish instead of meaningful content. Therefore, despite the style of the font, the text lacks substantive information.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the visual elements (dress, headdress, dance pose, temple design, and mythical creatures) reflect authentic Balinese cultural symbols and traditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dancer with a traditional Balinese outfit, complete with elaborate headdress and dress, performing a dance pose, all of which are accurate representations of Balinese culture. The temple and mythical creatures also exhibit elements that are consistent with Balinese architecture and mythology, highlighting authenticity. Hence, the visual elements in Image B reflect genuine Balinese cultural symbols and traditions.",
