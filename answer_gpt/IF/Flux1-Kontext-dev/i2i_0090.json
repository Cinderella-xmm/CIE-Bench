      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two views of the stapler are presented: one showing the front view of the stapler and the other showing the rear view.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the front and rear views of the stapler are fully shown, with no parts cut off or missing on either of the segments. This is concluded by the complete visual outline and full visibility of the staplerâ€™s structure.",
