      "question": "Is the woman depicted in a stylized cartoon form with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a woman with simplified facial and body features, typical of a cartoon style. Her proportions are more exaggerated compared to realistic human figures, as evidenced by the large eyes and stylized hair. Such representations are common in cartoon illustrations as they often simplify details for artistic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress visibly enlarged and accented with gold highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the dress are indeed visibly prominent and stand out more than typical floral embroidery might in real life. They appear to have golden accents that provide a contrast to the main dress color, which is often used in illustrations to enhance visual impact.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit radiant or luminous color tones, such as glowing or highly saturated hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B features bright and vibrant colors, consistent with the style of cartoon illustrations, which often employ strong, saturated colors to capture attention and convey liveliness. Although not literally glowing, the hues are evidently radiant in this form of illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are abstract, non-realistic bamboo shadows present in the image to enhance depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes bamboo stalks as part of the background, which contribute to a sense of depth but the shadows around them appear somewhat uniform and stylized, indicative of a cartoon representation that simplifies realistic shadowing. Such illustrations tend to use abstract forms rather than detailed shadows.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a blank panel situated in the lower right section, bordered by bamboo motifs. The panel is designed in a rectangular frame which gives the impression of softness and an artistic watercolor style, often incorporated to echo the theme of bamboo and nature.",
