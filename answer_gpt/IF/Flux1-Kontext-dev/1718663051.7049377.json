      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding elements exhibit clear geometric contours and segmented areas resembling stained glass panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree and its surrounding elements are clearly defined with bold, black outlines. The sections within these outlines are filled with different colors, giving an appearance similar to segments in stained glass. The sun's rays are represented as distinct sections with definite boundaries rather than as a natural light dispersion. This style is characteristic of stained glass art, which often features outlined, segmented areas. Therefore, Image B does exhibit clear geometric contours and segmented areas similar to stained glass panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the treeâ€™s branches composed of angular, geometric shapes rather than organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches of the tree do not exhibit sharp angles or predominantly geometric forms. Instead, they maintain a natural, curvilinear appearance, consistent with organic shapes. Despite the stained glass style in the image, the tree's branches retain the flowing, irregular forms typical of natural trees. In contrast, geometric shapes would be more rigid and angular.",

      "question": "Is the grass rendered in desaturated, low-saturation colors consistent with a muted palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass appears vividly colored with bright shades characteristic of stained glass art, rather than using desaturated or muted tones. The colors are bold and high in saturation, consistent with stained glass design which typically employs vibrant hues to capture light. Therefore, the depiction in Image B does not align with a desaturated or muted palette.",

      "question": "Are the mountains depicted with sharp, angular forms and colored in shades of bronze and teal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains maintain smooth and natural contours rather than sharp, angular forms. They are colored in shades of dark blue, lacking the bronze and teal tones described. The depiction fits more with smooth silhouettes found in traditional landscapes rather than sharp, angular representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient and include visible accentuated lines or decorative patterns that convey vintage elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is divided into sections with bold, dark lines that radiate from the sun, resembling the rays often used in stained glass art. While the colors transition smoothly, the presence of these pronounced lines takes precedence over any subtle gradient and contributes to the stylized and decorative effect associated with stained glass rather than vintage elegance.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the elements in the image composed of flat, solid-colored regions bounded by dark, defined lines characteristic of stained glass art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a technique where elements are designed with dark, definitive outlines bounding areas of solid, flat color. This characteristic is emblematic of stained glass art where individual pieces of glass are separated by leading and dark outlines, each segment being a different color or texture. The image effectively mimics this style, showing strong resemblance to stained glass compositions.",
