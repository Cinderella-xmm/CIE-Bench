      "question": "Has the floral embroidery on the kimono been transformed into gold foil detailing with visible metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the floral details on the kimono appear less like traditional embroidery and more metallic, resembling gold foil. The brightness and reflectivity suggest a sheen indicating gold foil, rather than thread embroidery. Image A shows typical embroidered floral patterns without any sheen or metallic effect, reinforcing the difference in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there iridescent highlights present in the woman's hair, showing color-shifting effects under light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair appears to have highlights that reflect varying colors under the light, suggesting iridescence. This is noticeable in the way some strands catch light, presenting a slight shift in hue or brightness, which imitates iridescent effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bamboo in the background rendered in a watercolor style with soft edges and translucent washes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents bamboo with soft edges and transitions that are characteristic of watercolor artwork. The blending of greens and light use gives a washed and translucent appearance, as opposed to Image A where bamboo is solid with clean, distinct edges.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there floral-shaped areas in the image that serve as writing spaces, positioned to allow text placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, there are no visible floral-shaped areas that are distinctively designed for text placement. The image primarily focuses on decoration and does not include any such practical areas for writing, unlike the possibility suggested by the floral motif.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a border that appears to be more than merely flat. The decoration around the edges displays visual traits reminiscent of embossing, such as shadowing and detail emphasis that suggest texture or raised elements. This contrasts with the borderless Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
