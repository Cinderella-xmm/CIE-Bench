      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the octopus replaced by a series of curved ceramic sculptures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is depicted as a single blue octopus-like figure with smooth curves rather than a series of separate sculptures. The coherent structure and absence of distinct, separate pieces suggest that it is not a series of sculptures but a singular object. World knowledge about sculptures indicates that a 'series' typically implies multiple distinct pieces, which is not the case here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sculptures exhibit a glossy, reflective surface consistent with glazed ceramic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the octopus-like object in Image B appears to have a shiny, smooth finish, which is characteristic of a glazed ceramic surface. This visual cue suggests that it has a glossy and reflective quality.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sculptures colored in deep oceanic blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color of the octopus-like object in Image B is a deep blue, reminiscent of oceanic hues. This conclusion is drawn from the distinct blue tones that are commonly associated with deep ocean colors, as seen in the visual cues provided.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sculptures feature textured scales that resemble the original octopus skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head of the octopus-like figure in Image B has a textured surface with a scale pattern. While it is stylized and more pronounced than a real octopus, it does give an impression inspired by the texture of octopus skin, albeit in a more geometric and exaggerated form. This suggests a resemblance to the original octopus skin.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a smooth, sandy-colored surface without natural textures or features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain, uniform sandy color without visible patches, rocks, waves, or other natural textures. This typically indicates a surface that lacks the complex and varied textures found in nature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a harmonious wave pattern that reflects the motion of ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The octopus-like object in Image B is not arranged in a pattern, but is presented as a single entity with curled appendages. There is no clear indication of multiple sculptures or an arrangement that suggests a wave pattern. Thus, it doesn't reflect the motion of ocean waves as a pattern of multiple objects would.",
