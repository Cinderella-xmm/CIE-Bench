    "Question": "Q2: Do the whoopie pies have cartoon-style facial expressions (eyes, mouths) and limbs to represent them as expressive characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pies do not have any facial features such as eyes or mouths, nor do they have any arms or legs that would identify them as expressive characters.

}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a playful kitchen scene with recognizable kitchen elements (e.g., stove, sink, utensils)?",

The second panel shows an outdoor setting with trees, clouds, and a grassy yard, typical of an outside environment, not a kitchen. Though a spatula is included, it's held by a character and not part of the background.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: In the first panel, are two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate, looking over with curious expressions?",
