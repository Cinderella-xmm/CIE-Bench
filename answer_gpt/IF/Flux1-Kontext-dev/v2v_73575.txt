    "Question": "Q2: Does the bird on the right appear as a luminous crystalline structure with sharp edges and a glowing effect?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the right is designed to look like a luminous crystalline structure. Its translucent body and the internal web-like patterns enhance the appearance of being made from a crystal material.
