    "Question": "Q1: Has the kangaroo been redesigned to resemble a Funko Pop figure box in an isometric perspective?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there's a box that appears to have the 'POP!' branding, which is characteristic of Funko Pop figure packaging.

The isometric perspective is visible from the angled view of the box shown in the image.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the packaging labeled with the name 'BOUNCY COMPANION'?",
    "explanation": "The packaging in Image B indeed has the wording 'BOUNCY COMPANION' displayed prominently on the box. This is recognizable because the text is clearly printed on the front of the box beneath the illustration of the kangaroo.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the box contain a chibi-style kangaroo figure with a pouch, a grassy base, and hopping-related elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure inside the box has a chubby, simplified appearance, typical of chibi-style designs. The figure is displayed inside a box and includes a visible pouch and a base that resembles grass. The elements associated with hopping or movement are not specifically detailed, but the presence of a base may imply a related theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a highly realistic version of the kangaroo figure depicted outside the packaging with intricate textures and lighting?",
    "explanation": "Next to the box in Image B, there is a kangaroo figure that appears very detailed and realistic, with intricate textures on its fur and appropriate lighting to enhance its naturalistic appearance. This is in contrast to the more stylized rendering of the figure inside the box.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the original kangaroo's pose and setting been maintained while integrating the new elements?",
    "explanation": "The original kangaroo in Image A was shown mid-hop in a natural setting. In Image B, while the natural background is maintained, the introduction of the Funko Pop-style box and figure, as well as the highly realistic figure, alters the scene significantly, and the original dynamic pose of the kangaroo is no longer the focus. Therefore, the original pose and setting have not been maintained.",
    "answer": "No"
