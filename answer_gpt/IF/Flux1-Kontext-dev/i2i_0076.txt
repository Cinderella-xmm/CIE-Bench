    "Question": "Q3: Are all original elements, such as the sofa, cushions, rug, plant, and wall art, still present without alteration except for additions?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, elements such as the sofa, cushions, rug, plant, and wall art are clearly visible.

    "Question": "Q4: Does the image convey a 'home living' feel with warm tones, soft lighting, and cozy arrangement of furniture?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a graphic design element with a mountainous sunset view, paired with text.
