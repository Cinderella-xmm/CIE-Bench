    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the image been converted into a realistic cartoon rendering style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a red truck with simplified lines, vibrant colors, and a stylized background. The features are less detailed compared to realistic photography and exhibit characteristics of cartoon rendering, such as bold outlines and a lack of fine detail, indicating a shift to a cartoon style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the truck retain its original structure in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's general shape and design elements match those in Image A, such as the cab structure, number of wheels, and placement of exhaust pipes. Despite stylistic changes, the core design and structural features remain consistent with the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lines in the truck bolder compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a truck with prominent, thick outlines around its components, typical of cartoon art. This contrasts with Image A, where lines are subtle or blended into the realistic rendering. Thus, the truck's lines are indeed bolder in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the colors in the image been made more vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses strikingly bright and saturated colors compared to Image A, which has more natural, muted tones. The exaggerated coloring in the edited image is a common trait in cartoon renditions, confirming an increase in color vividness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background in the image simplified compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background trees and sky are represented with minimal detail and stylized forms, as opposed to the realistic textures in Image A. The edited image simplifies these elements by using basic shapes and uniform color fills, often seen in cartoon art.",
