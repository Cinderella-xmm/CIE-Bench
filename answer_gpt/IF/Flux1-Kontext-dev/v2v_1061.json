      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge itself is not made of tassel material. The primary part of the badge appears to be a circular design which is likely made of metal or another hard material depicting an image. However, there is a tassel attached to the bottom of the badge, which is a traditional decorative element often made from strands of thread or similar materials. Thus, while the badge is not made of tassel material, it does incorporate a tassel.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge design mirrors the vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the structure visible in the rest of the image. The badge depicts the same or a similar architectural scene with the colorful domes and details reminiscent of the cathedral from Image A. This suggests that the badge's design is lively, capturing the essence and vibrant colors seen in the background structure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge does not appear to be designed in an anime style. Anime styles typically feature characteristics like exaggerated facial features, distinct line art, and expression-focused designs. The badge in this image reflects a realistic depiction of a famous architectural scene rather than adopting an anime style.",
