    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a bottle-shaped object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure resembles both a bottle and the Eiffel Tower. The shape is elongated, similar to a bottle, especially with the cap-like top, indicating that the Eiffel Tower has been visually merged with a bottle shape to create a bottle-like appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the structure have a transparent or glass-like appearance with embossed lattice patterns resembling the Eiffel Tower's framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure appears to have a glass-like transparency, allowing the background to be visible through it. The surface has embossed patterns that mimic the lattice work typical of the Eiffel Tower, giving the appearance of a glass bottle while retaining the Eiffel Tower's characteristic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a gold-colored, metallic-looking base supporting the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a metallic base at the bottom of the bottle structure, but rather, the structure seems to seamlessly connect with the ground, maintaining the illusion of the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, no distinct gold-colored base is present at the bottom.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a faint depiction of a Parisian skyline visible on the surface of the glass bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is semi-transparent, allowing the Parisian skyline, including buildings and trees, behind the structure to be visible through it. This implies a faint depiction of the skyline on the surface of what appears to be a glass bottle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small, simple, and modern logo located at the neck of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Near the top of the bottle structure in Image B, there is a visible logo or insignia placed on what appears to be the neck or cap of the bottle. It is small, simple, and modern in design, which is common for branding purposes on such objects.",
