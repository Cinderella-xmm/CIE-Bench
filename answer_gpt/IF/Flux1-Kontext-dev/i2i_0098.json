      "question": "Is the mirror still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no longer a mirror above the sink. Instead, I observe a piece of art hanging on the wall, which takes up a similar space as the mirror in the original Image A. Based on world knowledge, if a mirror is removed from its position and replaced by something else, it is considered no longer present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the area previously occupied by the mirror been replaced with a minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the area above the sink that in Image A was occupied by a mirror is now occupied by a piece of art. The art depicts a landscape scene of mountains, trees, and a path, which is characteristic of minimalist landscape art due to its simplified elements and clear imagery.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the minimalist landscape wall art appear to have a fabric canvas material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the wall art displays a textured quality that is consistent with a fabric canvas material. The visual evidence suggests a grainy, textile-like appearance, which is commonly associated with canvas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the elements such as the sink, vase, lights, and tiles appear consistent between both images. No unintentional alterations are evident; the primary change is the replacement of the mirror with wall art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any additional elements or changes in the image beyond removing the mirror and replacing it with a minimalist landscape wall art on a fabric canvas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examination, the only noticeable modification in Image B is the substitution of the mirror with landscape art. Other elements remain unchanged. There are no new elements or additional changes observed in Image B beyond this main alteration.",
