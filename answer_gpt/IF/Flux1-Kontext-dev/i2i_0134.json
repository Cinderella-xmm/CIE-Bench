      "question": "Has the desk and background been replaced with a forest floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli is positioned on what appears to be a forest floor, indicated by the presence of soil and small plants around it. The background shows trees and a lush green environment typical of a forest, replacing any indication of an indoor setting, such as a desk. This suggests that the original surface and background have been replaced with a forest setting.",

    {

      "question": "Does the broccoli appear camouflaged as a small real tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The broccoli in Image B is positioned on the forest floor and surrounded by natural elements like soil and foliage, and the background features vertical tree trunks. The shape and color of the broccoli floret resemble a tree canopy, and the lighting creates an effect where the broccoli could be perceived as a small tree fitting into the forest setting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there sunlight filtering through the canopy in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is visible sunlight streaming through the upper part of the image, which creates a dappled lighting effect commonly seen in forests when sunlight filters through tree canopies. This effect adds to the realism of the forest scene and the lighting on the broccoli.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the broccoli positioned naturally within the forest floor, as if it were growing there?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The broccoli in Image B is placed directly on the forest floor with soil and other natural elements surrounding it, suggesting an attempt to make it appear as though it is naturally growing there. However, given the broccoli's size in relation to the forest floor, it may not perfectly mimic a naturally growing tree, but the intention to integrate it into the environment is clear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene convey a natural and believable camouflage effect of the broccoli as a tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B is carefully constructed with suitable forest floor elements, lighting, and an appropriate background to make the broccoli blend in as if it were part of the natural environment. The similarity in colors and texture between the broccoli and the surrounding forest enhances its camouflaged appearance, convincingly making it look like a part of the forest.",
