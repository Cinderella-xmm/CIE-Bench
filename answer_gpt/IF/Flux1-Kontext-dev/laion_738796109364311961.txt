    "Question": "Q1: Has the image been transformed into a cartoon-inspired illustration style with exaggerated features and bold lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image shows what seems like a stylized presentation, possibly on a box or card, which gives a slight impression of being a cartoon-style due to the angle and presentation. However, the features and lines remain realistic rather than exaggerated or transformed into a cartoon style. Thus, based on world knowledge of cartoon illustrations, which typically have bold outlines and stylized features, this image does not fully exhibit those traits.",
