    "Question": "Q1: Has the black bottle cap been replaced with a transparent or translucent glass stopper?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cap on the bottle appears to be transparent or translucent, typical of a glass stopper often seen on fragrance diffuser bottles. This is a departure from the black colored cap seen on the bottle in Image A, which is indicative of a traditional whiskey bottle. By using common knowledge about bottle caps and how they differ between liquid containers like whiskey bottles and fragrance diffusers, we can deduce that the cap has been replaced with a glass stopper.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are thin, dark-colored reeds visible protruding from the top of the bottle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle clearly has thin, dark-colored reeds sticking out from the top, which is characteristic of a fragrance diffuser. These reeds help in dispersing the fragrance into the surrounding area. In contrast, Image A does not have any reeds, aligning with its function as a whiskey bottle. This difference supports the conclusion that Image B depicts a transformation into a fragrance diffuser.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the label display an art deco design with geometric patterns, symmetrical elements, or stylized fonts?",
    "explanation": "The label in Image B appears to feature art deco design elements: It has stylized fonts and symmetrical arrangements, often associated with art deco styles that blend elegance with geometric design principles. By examining the label design in Image A, which is more straightforward and traditional for whisky labeling, the change in Image B is evident.

    "Question": "Q5: Are floral or botanical illustrations (such as flowers, leaves, or plants) present on the label?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the label features illustrations of plants or botanicals, which are visible at the bottom of the design. This is a characteristic of fragrance packaging that often emphasizes natural elements and scents, unlike the original whisky label in Image A which does not include such illustrations. This change supports the depiction of Image B as a fragrance diffuser.",
