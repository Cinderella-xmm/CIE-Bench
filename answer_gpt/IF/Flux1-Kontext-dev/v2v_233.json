      "question": "Is the leaf enclosed within a transparent spherical container resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is depicted inside a transparent sphere that resembles a snow globe. This is identified by the spherical shape and the typical features of a snow globe, such as its clarity and resemblance to glass. The image depicts the boundary of the sphere clearly surrounding the leaf, confirming it is enclosed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a surface resembling a tabletop near a window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe resting on a flat, smooth surface which resembles a tabletop. The presence of what appears to be a window is suggested by the framing and the light coming through, creating an indoor setting often associated with tabletops, confirming that it is placed near a window.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background softly blurred and contains warm tones such as orange or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is indeed softly blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field which creates a bokeh effect, typical in photography to focus on a subject while softening the background. The colors in the blurred background predominantly feature warm tones like orange and yellow, consistent with sunlight filtering through.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there golden sparkles scattered within the snow globe due to sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the snow globe contains numerous small bright spots that resemble golden sparkles. This effect is consistent with reflections or light play that occurs when sunlight passes through glass spheres or snow globes, creating sparkles inside the globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the leaf in a spherical container; its position and the visual cues suggest it is suspended in some medium. However, while it may suggest a possible liquid environment due to ripple-like textures, there are no clear indications of typical snowflake shapes drifting around the leaf inside the globe.",
