      "question": "Is the bridge transformed into a creature resembling an ancient forest guardian, with organic features replacing mechanical ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a transformation in which a bridge from Image A is depicted as a creature resembling an ancient forest guardian. The creature has features like moss-covered limbs and a natural, organic appearance replacing the mechanical structure of the bridge. This interpretation is based on the visual elements in Image B, where the structure appears animate and has features characteristic of a mythical forest entity.",

      "question": "Are the bridge towers transformed into wooden limbs covered in foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge towers are depicted with features that resemble wooden limbs, as opposed to the metal structure in Image A. These limbs have a wooden appearance and are shrouded in foliage, contributing to the organic transformation theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bridge arches reshaped into a ribcage-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of the bridge arches being reshaped into a ribcage-like structure. Instead, a creature stands in front of the bridge, featuring an organic form that doesn't incorporate ribcage-like structures originating from the bridge's previous design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bridge cables replaced with vine-like tendrils that support the creatureâ€™s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the bridge cables is not replaced by vine-like tendrils supporting any creature form. Although the creature's presence suggests organic motifs, the bridge's actual cables are not depicted as such tendrils in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone bases replaced with moss-covered roots extending into the flowing stream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's legs mimic the appearance of moss-covered roots, but they do not directly replace the stone bases of the bridge as observed in Image A. The depiction of roots is part of the creature's design rather than a transformation of the stone elements in the original bridge structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the creature have a head made of bark texture with glowing emerald eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image suggests that the creature might have a head with a bark texture; however, the presence of glowing emerald eyes is not visible in Image B. The blurred portion of the creature conceals specific details about its facial features, preventing a definitive confirmation of glowing eyes.",
