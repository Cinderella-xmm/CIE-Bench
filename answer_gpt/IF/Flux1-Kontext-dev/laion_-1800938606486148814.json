      "question": "Has the shoe upper been replaced with a transparent material that reveals intricate circuitry patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe upper features visible intricate circuitry patterns that give it a futuristic appearance. This visual suggests that the material is not traditional or opaque, but rather designed to showcase underlying designs, possibly through transparency or embossing techniques. Such visual cues combined with modern design trends indicate an intent to reveal inner details akin to circuitry.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Nike Swoosh logo is visibly glowing with a neon blue color, enhancing the futuristic theme. The glow effect is a common visual representation of advanced technology and modern aesthetics, often associated with digital or neon designs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible strap on the shoe that includes a small digital screen displaying dynamic animations. The futuristic elements focus more on the shoe's overall design rather than specific additions like a digital screen on a strap.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a digital shoe box or a futuristic storage element in the background, which features distinct high-tech elements. However, the surface does not clearly convey a metallic finish or holographic effect, but rather a digital glow with branding. The concepts of 'collapsible' and 'metallic finish' are not explicitly conveyed through the visual.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background element in Image B (interpreted as a digital shoe box) does showcase modern design elements with geometric patterns as part of its visual. These patterns are typical of contemporary digital and technological aesthetics, often used to suggest complexity and futurism.",
