      "question": "Is the ornate lantern now presented as a candle brand packaging rather than a hanging light fixture?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe a box featuring the ornate lantern along with flames, suggesting its use as a candle brand packaging. The presence of decorative elements implies its possible use for merchandise display, distinguishing it from its original hanging light fixture function. Common sense tells us that items packaged in boxes are often intended for sale as branded products.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box incorporates ornate patterns and designs that resemble those on the original lantern.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the foreground of Image B, there are visual cues such as the depiction of flames which signify candle imagery; however, there is no clear indication of the flame being a metallic embossed logo.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a box with patterns similar to those in traditional designs, but does not incorporate specific identifiable marketplace elements like spices or stalls into its texture.
