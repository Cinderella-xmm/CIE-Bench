        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's outfit and overall appearance exhibit a cartoon style, characterized by exaggerated features, such as bolder lines and simplified shapes.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays floral patterns that are more stylized and prominent compared to those in Image A.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clasp has taken on a simplified, stylized form that fits the overall cartoon aesthetic rather than being intricately detailed or resembling jade. The original image's clasp may have more intricate and realistic detailing, but such features are typically simplified in cartoon renderings to match the artistic style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases colors that are more vibrant and saturated, typical of cartoon styles which often use brighter and bolder color palettes to achieve a visually striking and appealing effect.

      "explanation": "In Image B, there are sections that appear as banners or frames, featuring gold foil-like borders and set against a rich blue background, contributing to the ornamental and luxurious cartoon style. This decorative addition isn't typical in realistic imagery, indicating artistic license taken in the edited image.",
