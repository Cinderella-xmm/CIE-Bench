        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite certain elements being indistinctive, such as facial features, the attire, posture, and book in her hands are clear indicators in the central panel that it's the same elderly woman in the context provided. Hence, she is still recognizable.",
