      "question": "Does the image exhibit flat color fields, bold outlines, and minimal shading consistent with traditional Japanese woodblock prints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows characteristics typical of traditional Japanese woodblock prints, such as flat color application, distinct bold outlines, and minimal shading.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figureâ€™s facial expression calm and composed, with eyes slightly closed or downcast, indicating serene contemplation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
