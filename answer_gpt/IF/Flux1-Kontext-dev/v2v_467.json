      "question": "Does the oatmeal blend include pet-safe ingredients like salmon bits, pumpkin puree, and oats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B has text that mentions 'oats mix' and 'salmon.' Although the remaining description seems nonsensical (e.g., 'Adglentr & kite'), the mention of salmon aligns with typical pet-safe ingredients often found in cat products. Pumpking puree cannot be confirmed due to the lack of clear textual evidence or imagery. Based on the visible information and common pet mix ingredients, only some elements are confirmed.",
