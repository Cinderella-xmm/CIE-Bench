    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the overall lines and contours of the image now clear and well-defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines and contours are now illustrated with clear outlines characteristic of vector-based graphics, which allows for sharp definition and clarity compared to rendered images. This illustration technique emphasizes bold lines and distinct edges, resulting in a clear and well-defined appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the original textures been replaced with soft gradient blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses flat colors and smooth gradient blocks, shown in the background and characters' clothing, replacing the textures found in Image A. This is a common stylistic choice in digital illustrations which enhances smooth transitions in color while retaining clear outlines.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image now exhibit characteristics of a high-end commercial illustration (e.g., refined and sophisticated appearance)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features sleek design elements and minimalistic use of color, which are typical traits in high-end commercial illustrations intended for branding or editorial purposes. This stylistic choice helps convey a refined and sophisticated appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges and boundaries between elements in the image now sharply defined and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements are delineated with precise lines and clearly separated colors, creating a sharp and crisp visual presentation that is a hallmark of digital illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do areas previously filled with detailed textures now feature smooth, soft gradients instead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, areas that contained detailed textures in Image A, such as the clothing and background, now exhibit smooth gradients and solid color blocks. Digital illustration techniques often include the use of gradients for a simplistic yet visually appealing appearance.",
