    "Question": "Q1: Does the image feature a gradient background with pastel colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bathroom has a strong color presence with vivid hues, particularly dominated by intense pink and blue shades. These colors are not pastel as pastels are characterized by soft, light tones. Instead, the colors here are neon and highly saturated, which is not typical of pastel shades.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible neon lighting effects around the mirror or sink area?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly showcases very bright, electric colors like pink and blue surrounding the mirror and sink area, indicating the use of neon lighting effects. These extreme bright and contrasting colors are typical of neon lighting, often used to create a striking, retro look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Has the overall bathroom scene been transformed into a retro-futuristic style characteristic of vaporwave?",
    "explanation": "The use of intense neon colors like pink and blue in Image B, alongside the sleek, modern aesthetic of the mirror and sink, suggests a transformation into a retro-futuristic style common in vaporwave art. This style often features such elements, combining old and new with vivid, electronic colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the gradient background consistently applied throughout the bathroom scene without disrupting the visual coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while there are vivid neon colors present, the notion of a 'gradient background' implies a smooth transition between colors. However, the background here does not show a smooth gradient transition; instead, it has stark contrasts between the neon pink and blue lighting, which disrupts visual coherence.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the original objects like the mirror, sink, and cabinet retain their form but now reflect a vaporwave design influence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror, sink, and cabinet maintain their forms when compared to Image A. However, they now reflect a vaporwave design influence through the application of neon colors and lighting effects, which are characteristic of this style, thereby altering their visual context while keeping their structure intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
