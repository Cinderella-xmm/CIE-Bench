      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a truck model built entirely from LEGO bricks, which is evident from the visible interlocking brick patterns typical of LEGO constructions. The truck body features colors commonly found in LEGO sets, such as orange, black, and silver, which are utilized to mimic the aesthetic features of a real vehicle. The visual cues such as the brick patterns and the vibrant, homogeneous color application indicate that this model is indeed a LEGO construction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels appear to be made from circular LEGO pieces, which are uniformly gray in color. These pieces differ from traditional tire and rim designs in real vehicles, as they lack the textures and materials typical of actual automotive wheels, such as rubber and metal. The smooth, uniform look and the characteristic grooves or studs of LEGO parts support the conclusion that these wheels are constructed from LEGO pieces.",

      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the truck bed is covered with black sections that have the smooth appearance of LEGO tiles rather than the textured finish of a real truck bed seen in Image A. The use of symmetrical and visually homogenous LEGO elements presents a more flat and consistent surface compared to the varied texture expected in a genuine truck bed, indicating a replacement with LEGO tiles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck model is clearly situated on a white surface with a plain and smooth appearance, resembling a shelf or display stand. This surface is consistent in texture and color, creating an impression of the model being elevated above a conventional ground level, contrasting with Image A where the truck rests on a rocky surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the correct shape and proportions of the original pickup truck, including the cab, bed, and wheelbase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite being constructed from LEGO pieces, Image B's model maintains the fundamental proportions and shape characteristics of a pickup truck. The cab, bed, and wheelbase are recreated in a way that preserves the overall outline and dimensions evident in Image A, showcasing an accurate representation. The visual cues from the brick structure reflect careful attention to mimicking the proportions of a real vehicle while using LEGO, ensuring the model resembles the original pickup truck shape.",
