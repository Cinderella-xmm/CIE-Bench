      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, there are flowering plants and ferns visible inside the glass dome, but they do not appear to be growing directly from the spout or lid of the teapot. Instead, they are arranged around the teapot, making this setup more of a decorative composition rather than parts growing from the teapot.",
