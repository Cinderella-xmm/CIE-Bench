      "question": "Is the central body of the drone redesigned to resemble a robotic face with sharp, angular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the drone has been modified to resemble a robotic entity with distinct facial features such as eye-like elements or angular shapes. The sharp, angular features suggest a design that mimics a mechanistic face. Based on common design cues, this transformation indicates an intentional reimagining of the drone into a more personal, humanoid form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rotor blades replaced with arm-like structures that appear to be capable of rotation and are positioned as if in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the rotor blades in positions that imply rotation and action, resembling arm-like structures engaged in motion. The repurposing of rotor blades into dynamic components aligns with common sci-fi themes where mechanical configurations are shown as being versatile and adaptive.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original landing gears replaced with multiple spider-like mechanical legs extending from the drone’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure suggests that the drone retains its landing gear or similar mechanical extensions but does not show multiple spider-like mechanical legs. The transformation involves the integration of humanoid features rather than altering the landing apparatus significantly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the character flying over a cityscape which features a night-time setting with high-rise structures and advanced architecture. This visual cue corresponds to typical futuristic urban environments depicted in illustrations, suggesting advancements in architectural design and tech elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character presents a metallic surface typical of robotics and machinery, with sleek design and reflective elements that suggest advanced materials. The presence of glowing highlights further supports the inference of a metallic and technologically advanced appearance.",
