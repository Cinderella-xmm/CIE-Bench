      "question": "Have the fresh green cilantro sprigs been replaced with tiny, ornate blue dragons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe small blue dragon figurines positioned on top of the food. These dragons replace the cilantro sprigs visible in Image A. The color and shape clearly distinguish the dragons from cilantro, as cilantro is green and leafy, while dragons are blue, textured, and represent mythical creatures. Therefore, the substitution of cilantro with dragon figurines is confirmed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the scales of the blue dragons mirror the delicate blue floral design of the white porcelain bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the blue dragons have scales and texture typical of dragon figurines, but their design does not appear to reproduce or mirror the floral design on the bowl. The bowl has a distinct floral pattern while the dragons feature more abstract and mythical detailing. Although they are both blue, there is no direct mirroring of design between the dragons and the bowl's floral pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the blue dragons shown breathing faint wisps of orange curry-scented smoke?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the blue dragons placed on the food without any visible smoke effects. The image provides no visual cues of smoke, either faint or strong, emanating from the dragons. The original food has an orange curry-like appearance, but no smoke is evident in association with the dragons. The absence of smoke is clear from simple visual inspection.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the chicken pieces been transformed into dragon eggs made of shimmering, solidified curry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chicken pieces maintain their overall appearance and texture consistent with curry dish elements rather than dragon eggs. Although the blue dragons are added to the dish, the food itself does not resemble eggs in shape or form; it remains as pieces of chicken in curry sauce as evident in Image A as well. Therefore, the chicken pieces have not transformed into dragon eggs.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and context of the original image been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the only significant alteration is the substitution of cilantro with dragon figurines. The bowl, the curry, and the layout of the dish remain unchanged otherwise. Therefore, while there is a noticeable edit, the context of the dish being presented, its culinary nature, and overall composition are maintained with the same primary elements in the same positions.",
