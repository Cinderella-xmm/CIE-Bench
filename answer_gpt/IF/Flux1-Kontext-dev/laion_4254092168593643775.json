    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall image framed or designed to resemble a product label with defined edges and layout consistent with a beverage packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design has a defined edge and organized layout, characterized by a bright yellow background and centralized graphics, typical features of a product label designed for attraction and brand identity. Additionally, the use of bold text and simplistic graphic elements contribute to a coherent design often seen in beverage packaging. The presence of typography like 'FUEL' indicates thematic branding often found on product labels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible, stylized streaks of sand in the background that convey motion and act as graphic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is stylized to include graphic elements that resemble streaks radiating from the center where the motorcycle is located. These streaks are not specifically sand but interpret motion visually, aligning with artistic representations of speed and dynamics without realistic depiction. This technique is often used to convey movement in simplified illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the motocross rider depicted as a simplified, high-contrast silhouette with minimal detail, emphasizing form over texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is illustrated with bold lines and a clear, simplified shape. The rider lacks detailed texture and shading, using high contrast to emphasize his form and posture over specific details, focusing mainly on the recognizable features like helmet and bike structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text \"RaceFuel\" displayed in bold, prominent typography somewhere within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'FUEL' is visible in bold, impactful typography, which is prominently placed with a visual emphasis that complements the overall theme. It is part of the designed narrative of speed and power, although the complete term 'RaceFuel' as specified is not present.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a track outline visible in the image, rendered in bright, vivid colors (e.g., red, yellow, blue) and positioned as an overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An outline of a track is not present in Image B. The graphic elements focus on the central rider, and the only colored bright elements are the background and accents on the motorcycle, not a track outline.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a speedometer icon located at the bottom of the image, showing a needle pointing to the maximum speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a speedometer at the bottom center of the design. However, the needle is pointing towards a numeric '60' that suggests there's more room to the maximum, rather than the maximum speed itself, which would typically be at the far edge. Still, its inclusion suggests speed and intensity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the combined visual elements—silhouette, streaks, typography, track, and speedometer—collectively communicate a narrative of power and speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B leverages dynamic elements such as the silhouette of the rider, a vibrant burst of streaks, bold typography, and the presence of a speedometer to convey a strong theme of power and speed. These visual components are strategically used to invoke the excitement and motion typical in racing contexts, albeit without a literal track depiction.",
