      "question": "Are there exactly five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one chibi-style figure visible next to the shoes. A Russian nesting doll set typically contains multiple dolls, often ranging from five to more in a set, with each doll fitting inside the next larger one. Here, only one figure is visible, not five.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a vibrant lime-green color and texture similar to the shoe and tennis ball in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure exhibits a vibrant lime-green color similar to the shoes. From Image A, we see that the tennis ball also shares this lime-green color with the shoe, indicating a uniform color across these items. Hence, the chibi doll in Image B also follows this color scheme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from largest to smallest in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features only one chibi-style figure beside the shoes, indicating there is no sequence of multiple dolls arranged by size. A typical organization from largest to smallest is not possible with only one figure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is placed on what appears to be a wooden table, as evidenced by the brown color and texture, as well as the visible drawer and knob that hint at sophistication and furniture design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain, soft-toned color without any patterns or designs, which does not draw attention away from the objects in the foreground. This makes it subtle and non-distracting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Determining the exact aspect ratio visually can be challenging, but Image B presents a typical rectangular frame that suggests common aspect ratios like 3:2, often used for photographs. Without precise measurement tools, this is an estimation based on common photography framing techniques.",
