    "Question": "Q1: Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is characterized by distinct pixelation, forming a blocky appearance typical of 8-bit graphics style. This stylistic choice is defined by visible rectangular pixels and a lack of fine detail, which aligns with the aesthetics of old video game graphics or pixel art. This pixelated effect is discernible through the visually sharp and well-defined squares that make up the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the table and the napkin exhibit a blocky, pixelated appearance characteristic of 8-bit graphics. The surfaces lack intricate detailing, trading realistic textures for simplified geometric forms. The napkin and the table are displayed using large, visible pixels, indicating a low-resolution rendering typical of early digital graphics and gaming systems.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a distinctive use of a limited color palette, as it consists of basic colors with minimal shading variations. This approach reflects the color constraints found in 8-bit graphics, where the number of colors simultaneously available on-screen was limited, resulting in vivid but fewer color selections to represent scenes and objects. This simplified palette is intentionally used to achieve the retro visual style associated with 8-bit art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of shadows and highlights is notably simplified, aligning with the flat shading often seen in 8-bit graphics. Instead of gradual transitions and detailed blending, these elements are represented by uniform color blocks with stark boundaries, typical of the limitations in rendering techniques from the early days of digital imagery.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B simplifies the overall composition by emphasizing basic shapes and forms over precise textures and intricate details. The image is rendered with an emphasis on core geometric forms and a clear separation of colors, rather than replicating complex textures. This is in line with the focus on simplicity found in 8-bit graphics, where the computational and display capabilities were restricted, leading to artwork that prioritizes clear and recognizable forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
