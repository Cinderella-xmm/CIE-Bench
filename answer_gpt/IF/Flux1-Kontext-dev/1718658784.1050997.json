    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cake feature bold, graphic icing patterns such as geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs instead of realistic frosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is depicted using bold graphic styles typical in pop art, characterized by repetitive motifs such as consistent dots and lines. These stylized forms replace any realistic frosting textures found in a traditional image, indicating the presence of geometric shapes and patterns instead of actual icing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloons composed of vivid monochrome dots rather than solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the balloons are filled with monochrome dots arranged in a halftone pattern rather than the solid colors seen in Image A. This aligns with pop art's typical use of dots and non-gradient colors for exaggerated visual effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the table rendered as a flat, solid color block without texture or gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the table using a flat, solid color typical of pop art style, lacking any gradient or texture details. This differs from Image A where shadows and gradients indicate dimension, contrasting with the stylized representation in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase depicted as a solid color block without visible texture or design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is rendered using minimalistic pop art techniques, with a simple color and outline, lacking in texture or intricate design patterns, different from the detailed portrayal in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the candle flame have exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candle flame in Image B is stylized with sharp lines and bold colors typical of pop art, an exaggerated representation compared to how a soft, natural flame would appear in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit characteristics of pop art, including flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B overall is characterized by pop art features, including the use of flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized geometric patterns throughout the elements. These are signature techniques of pop art, differing significantly from the detailed realism seen in Image A.",
