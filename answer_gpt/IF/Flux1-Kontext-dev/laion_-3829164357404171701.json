      "question": "Has the woven texture of the handbag been replaced with a scaly pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag maintains a woven texture that resembles a typical basket weave pattern. This is consistent with a natural fiber or material weave rather than a scaly appearance, which would resemble fish scales or reptile skin with overlapping pattern elements. Therefore, the texture remains woven and is not scaly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gray ribbons now appear as elegant wings rather than flat bows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray ribbons continue to look like traditional bow shapes with loops rather than taking on a wing-like form. Wings would typically be more extended, angular, and possibly feather-like, but these ribbons maintain their bow loops and tails, indicating that they have not changed into a wing structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the white flowers been transformed into eye-like features with surrounding ornate lashes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the white flowers retain their floral appearance with layered petals typical of certain types of flowers, like roses or peonies. They do not exhibit characteristics typical of eyes, such as a pupil or surrounding lashes. The detailed structure of petals does not mimic eyelashes, as those would be thin, elongated, and in a radial pattern around an eye. Thus, the flowers maintain their original floral form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there two delicate, sparkling antenna-like structures present near the handle of the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two ornate, feather-like structures placed above the handle of the bag. These structures are delicate and resemble decorative or artistic interpretations that could symbolize antennae. They have a sparkly and intricate design, which fits the description of antenna-like structures, thus indicating that these features have been added near the handle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the chain been transformed into a serpentine tail that curls gracefully beneath the bag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chain in Image B is visible as a metal chain whose links are consistent with traditional handbag chain accessories. The chain does extend and curl but retains its appearance as a chain without becoming more organic or snake-like, which would involve a different texture or shape. It reflects a typical design of a handbag chain rather than a serpentine or organic form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bag retain its original basket-like shape while being transformed into a creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag maintains its original shape with rounded contours and woven texture, resembling a standard basket handbag. While additional decorative elements, such as the wing-like structures and chain, suggest an artistic transformation, the fundamental shape and form of the bag itself remain unchanged. It continues to be recognizable as a basket-style handbag.",
