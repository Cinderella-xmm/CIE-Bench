    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Great Wall and surrounding mountains rendered as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the Great Wall and surrounding mountains as if they're encapsulated within a spherical object, likely a snow globe. The proportionality and encapsulation of the scene suggest a miniature representation. World knowledge tells us snow globes typically contain miniature landscape models instead of full-scale images or photographs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the miniature model of the Great Wall and mountains enclosed within a transparent, spherical snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the scene within a transparent spherical object, which resembles a snow globe in structure. This aligns with knowledge about snow globes being spherical and containing miniature scenes within them.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale human figures depicted walking along the Great Wall inside the snow globe, with visible details such as clothing or accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures on the Great Wall inside the snow globe are preserved in detail; visual cues show identifiable clothing colors and accessories which are consistent with typical representations of human figures in miniaturized models or photographs with high detail.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are areas of the landscape inside the snow globe adorned with bright autumn-colored foliage (e.g., red, orange, yellow leaves)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes scenes of red maple leaves suspended around the landscape representation within the snow globe. These evoke autumnal foliage colors, such as red, orange, and yellow, further enhanced by the edited globe environment. World knowledge about seasons suggests that these colors are typical of autumn.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible swirling snow effect inside the snow globe, with tiny white particles appearing to float or fall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no observable swirling snow effect typical of traditional snow globes. The interior remains largely free from any snow-like particles, suggesting the absence of this feature. Snow globes often contain such effects to mimic snowfall, but this one does not show these characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small, ceramic-looking birds depicted in flight inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any birds, ceramic or otherwise, inside the snow globe. Instead, there are red leaves or flowers in the image. World knowledge regarding snow globe contents indicates they often include thematic or related miniature figures, but in this case no birds are visible.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a dark wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the snow globe resting on a wooden base, which is dark and consistent with commonly used materials for snow globe bases. The visual cue of the wooden base aligns with world knowledge about typical snow globe construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
