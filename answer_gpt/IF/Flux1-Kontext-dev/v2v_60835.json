      "question": "Have the cheetahs' leg joints been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the cheetahs have a mechanical appearance, resembling parts that are constructed from polished brass, complete with intricate gears that mimic pistons. This gives the legs an artificial, metallic look which differs from natural cheetah anatomy. Such details are characteristic of steampunk or mechanical design, where mechanical parts are prominent. In contrast, Image A shows the natural anatomy of cheetah legs, covered in spotted fur without any metallic components.",

      "question": "Has the cheetahs' spotted fur been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the cheetahs appear to have sections of their bodies covered in what resembles tooled leather and copper plating, maintaining a similar shape but with a mechanical texture and sheen. This is in stark contrast to Image A, where the cheetahs are covered entirely in spotted fur, a natural characteristic of cheetahs. The introduction of these materials in Image B gives the animals a mechanized appearance.",

      "question": "Have the cheetahs' eyes been replaced with glowing amber lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the cheetahs are glowing, emitting a bright, amber light, suggesting a replacement with lenses rather than natural eyes. This glowing effect is associated with artificial or robotic traits, often depicted in fictional mechanical creatures. In Image A, the cheetahs maintain their natural, non-glowing eyes, typical of living animals.",

      "question": "Are there towering, fantastical clockwork structures visible in the distant savanna horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visible in the background of Image B are large, ornamental structures with clockwork elements, like gears and dials, resembling towers. This type of construction does not occur naturally and is reminiscent of fantasy or science fiction worlds where such architecture is possible. Conversely, Image A showcases a natural savanna landscape with no indication of man-made, fantastical structures.",

      "question": "Is the sky streaked with coppery clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is marked with clouds that have a distinct copper hue, a result either of lighting effects from a sunset or unnatural atmospheric conditions often found in artistic or stylized landscapes. This deviates from Image A, where the sky is a more natural color without such dramatic tones, typical of a typical savanna setting.",
