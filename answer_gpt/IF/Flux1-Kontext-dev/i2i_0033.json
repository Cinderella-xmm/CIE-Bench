    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict elements from extreme sports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a red background featuring abstract shapes and figures. These shapes do not directly suggest any extreme sports equipment or activity commonly recognizable such as skateboards, snowboards, or BMX bikes. Therefore, there's no clear representation of extreme sports elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person in the edited image shown in a jumping pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is illustrated wearing a suit and tie. His posture is upright, standing straight, which is a typical stance for a formal image rather than a dynamic jumping pose associated with action or movement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image feature bold outlines giving it a hand-drawn appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features bold black outlines around the person and background elements. These outlines are indicative of a hand-drawn artistic style, often used to enhance visual contrast and definition in illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are abstract graffiti elements visible within the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes irregular shapes and lines that resemble abstract graffiti art. Such elements are characterized by unconventional forms and patterns that are often seen in graffiti works.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background incorporate a concrete texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a flat color with abstract shapes which do not mimic concrete texture. Concrete texture would typically involve a gritty, speckled surface mimicking natural stone material, whereas the background here is more crisp and clear in style.",
