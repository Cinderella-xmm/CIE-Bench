      "question": "Are there five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls representing the individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features dolls on the wooden table next to the TV. From the visual cues, four chibi-style dolls are visible, each with a distinct size and color. There are not five dolls in the image; hence, the answer is based on the count of the visible dolls.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls sized from biggest to smallest in a progressive manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dolls appear progressively arranged from left to right, with size decreasing from largest to smallest based on their height and width. This arrangement suggests a hierarchical size progression typical in nested dolls.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls accurately reflect the individual's attire and stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, the individual is dressed in a plain long-sleeve shirt and jeans. The dolls, while nested, wear varied colorful attire that does not match the individual's clothing style. The stance of the dolls, standing upright, generally replicates the standing posture, but the attire does not match.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dolls are arranged in a neat sequence from left to right on the wooden table beside the TV. The arrangement indicates careful positioning side by side, suggesting organization.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aspect ratio of a 3:2 image is defined by its proportional dimensions in width to height. Visually assessing the edited image by its composition and framing, though the exact measurements are not available, the composition does generally align with a typical 3:2 aspect ratio used in photography.",
