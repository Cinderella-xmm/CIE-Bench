    "Question": "Q3: Is there a visible pastel-colored lace overlay applied to the image, particularly on the dress or surrounding area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dress retains its lace elements, similar to Image A. Additionally, the overall image uses pastel colors, including the veil's subtle coloring and the floral border features, but the overlay is most prominent on the border rather than the dress. Thus, while there are pastel tones in the lace of the veil, it's less about an overlay and more about the natural coloring of components.",
