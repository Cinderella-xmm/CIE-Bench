      "question": "Have the heads of the three individuals been made slightly bigger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the individuals with proportions that appear slightly exaggerated due to the potential manipulation of the head size. The heads seem larger in relation to their bodies, which might result in a somewhat caricatured effect, common in certain techniques to emphasize features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features and accessories of the three individuals precisely detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are blurred and lack precision, making it impossible to see any details or accessories distinctly. This is likely an intentional edit to obscure identities.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bodies of the three individuals have a cartoonish appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individuals in Image B have bodies that seem to maintain realistic proportions, unlike if they were exaggerated in a cartoonish manner. This is evident from the natural sizing and appearance of their winter clothing, without any disproportion typically seen in cartoons.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the log cabin appears to be of a realistic size relative to the individuals, as cabins are typically larger than people. The perspective shows them standing in front of the cabin, maintaining correct scale relationships.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the individuals in Image B is such that they stand in front of the log cabin. This is evidenced by the dominance of the cabin in the background, which maintains realistic proportions relative to their size.",
