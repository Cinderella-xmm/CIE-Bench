    "Question": "Q2: Are there soft blue highlights visible on the surface of the crystal castle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal castle features soft blue highlights on its surface. These highlights are visible as they stand out against the clear and transparent material of the crystal, suggesting the presence of colored light or internal reflections that give a bluish tint.

    "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean is not present as it is within the confines of a gallery display, which contains only the crystal sculpture, and lacks any depiction of waves or water.
