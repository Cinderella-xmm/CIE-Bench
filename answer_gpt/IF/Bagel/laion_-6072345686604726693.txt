    "Question": "Q1: Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the Hagia Sophia appears to be transformed into a creature-like figure. The center of the image showcases a large entity with a distinct body and head-like structure.
