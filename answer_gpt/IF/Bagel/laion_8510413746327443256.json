      "question": "Does the edited image show the smartwatch transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon with dragon-like anatomy integrated into the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a highly detailed representation of a dragon's head and part of its body. This is a complete departure from the original smartwatch design seen in Image A, which features a traditional smartwatch shape with a rectangular face and watch band. Since the edited image shows a dragon design rather than any form of a wristwatch, it does not depict a transformation of the smartwatch into a cybernetic wrist dragon integrated into the wrist.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the watch face replaced with a radiant, multi-layered holographic dragon eye featuring glowing elements and depth effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dragon's head with a prominently glowing eye, displaying depth and radiant features, which can be interpreted as a holographic feature. However, the original context of a watch face from Image A is no longer present. The given eye doesn't replace a watch face; it is part of a dragon image. Thus, it is not the transformation of a watch face but rather part of a dragon’s features.",

      "question": "Are the original silicone band and its contours replaced with a series of interlocking, metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the smartwatch has a silicone band. In Image B, the image is of a dragon’s head and part of its body, which includes a detailed depiction of silver scales. However, these scales are not representing a transformed watch band but are part of the dragon's body. There’s no evidence suggesting these scales cover a wrist portion reminiscent of a watch band transformation.",

      "question": "Has the digital crown been replaced with a glowing, spherical neural node emitting light or energy pulses, resembling a biotech interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the digital crown is recognizable as part of a smartwatch. Image B, showing a dragon, lacks any identifiable features of a crown or a spherical node. The design doesn’t include specific elements that would suggest a transformation mimicking a neural node that substitutes a digital crown.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original app icons on the watch face replaced with glowing, rune-like control sigils that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A contains app icons on the watch face typical of a smartwatch interface. Image B depicts a dragon's head with no interface or icons visible. The dragon's eye doesn't feature any control sigil design. Hence, the change from app icons to rune-like sigils as described is not present in this edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic form with visual cues such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, depicting a dragon, is characterized by its dynamic and life-filled appearance. The glowing eye, intricately detailed scales, and animated posture suggest motion and energy inherent in a living creature, unlike the static smartwatch shown in Image A.",
