      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows four chibi figures, they each hold a flower or leaf but don't clearly depict the specific actions mentioned like catching petals or gazing at trees.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the chibi characters against a pastel-colored background, but there's no visible distinction indicating that the surface is specifically a magnetic sheet. The image could depict sticker-like characters without explicit indication of magnet properties.",
