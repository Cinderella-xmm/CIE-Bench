      "question": "Does the edited image show thick impasto and swirling patterns typical of Van Gogh's style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling patterns in the background and the thick brush stroke-like textures on the mug and coaster are very suggestive of Van Gogh's style, seen notably in works like 'Starry Night.' These characteristic impasto techniques create dynamic movement and texture, typical of Van Gogh's distinctive style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the colors in the edited image been adapted to reflect Van Gogh's vibrant yet slightly muted palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bright blues, yellows, and greens, which are often seen in Van Gogh's paintings. His palette is known for its vibrant yet intentionally muted tones that create a dramatic and emotive effect, thus, the use of these colors in the edited image aligns with this characteristic style.",

      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit the textured surface typical of Van Gogh's oil paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features brush strokes that imitate the texture created by Van Gogh's impasto technique in oil paintings. This technique typically results in a textured, three-dimensional surface, giving depth and movement to the depicted subject, seen in the swirling and layered patterns.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the mug is a simple blue mug with smooth surfaces. In Image B, this composition has been altered to a more textured and stylized form using Van Gogh-like brushstrokes and colors, altering the simple structure of the original mug into a more ornate shape.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses impasto techniques, with swirling patterns and layered colors, typical of Van Gogh's methods to create depth and texture. The brush strokes and color application demonstrate a layering effect, adding visual depth, much like Van Gogh's paintings.",
