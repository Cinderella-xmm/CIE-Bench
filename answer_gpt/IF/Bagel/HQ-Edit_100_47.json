      "question": "Is the image presented as a three-dimensional shadow box diorama with visible depth created by layered components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a structured frame with layered components that add depth to the scene. The presence of seemingly layered skyline and landscape elements within the frame suggests a three-dimensional appearance, typical of shadow box dioramas known for creating depth. The structures appear to be placed at various levels within the frame, enhancing the three-dimensional effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the skyline and foreground elements visibly separated into multiple layered paper cut-out sections to simulate depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyline and foreground elements appear to be crafted in such a way that they resemble layered cut-outs, which is a technique used to simulate depth in art. This visual presentation is consistent with the appearance of layered paper cut-outs, where each section is positioned slightly behind another to give an illusion of depth and distance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the grassy lawn area been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface that shows reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a central area beneath the Eiffel Tower that appears to be a mirror-like surface, reflecting the shapes of nearby elements. In a typical visual analysis, this suggests the presence of a highly reflective surface instead of a grassy lawn, as reflections are visible indicating a difference in texture and material compared to grass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there numerous small, detailed, three-dimensional-looking pedestrian figures scattered throughout the scene, particularly on pathways and near the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows various small figures that appear to be cut out from paper and positioned within the shadow box. These figures, while flat, emulate a three-dimensional look because they are part of the layered structure, creating an illusion of depth and presence within the scene, particularly noticeable around the base of the Eiffel Tower.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene framed by a dark border with visible metallic edges, consistent with a shadow box enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is encased in a frame that appears to have a dark border with what looks like metallic edges, characteristic of shadow box frames. Such frames are designed to encase and protect three-dimensional art pieces, giving a polished finish with metallic or dark trims that enhance the shadow box effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are city names and geographic coordinates visibly engraved along the outer edge of the frame in fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Closer inspection of Image B reveals engravings along the outer edge of the frame, which appear to include text. Such text typically includes city names and geographic coordinates in a fine, detailed manner consistent with decorative engravings often found on artistic frames representing geographical or landmark context.",
