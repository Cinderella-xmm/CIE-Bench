      "question": "Is the character's head significantly larger than the body, consistent with chibi-style proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a character with a head disproportionately larger than the body, a common feature in chibi-style art. This style exaggerates the head-to-body ratio to make characters appear cute and playful.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) visibly exaggerated and prominent in size compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though the facial features are blurred, the character in Image B's style suggests they are typically exaggerated in chibi art. Chibi characters often have large and prominent facial features, which are key characteristics of this art style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character in a shirt with bright yellow and turquoise stripes, differing from the original image's red and white stripes on a darker background. The color scheme in Image B is more vibrant and contrasts significantly with the subtle tones of Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the character appears smooth and glossy, much like polished enamel. The distinct and rounded outline suggests it could be a magnet or decorative item shape, emphasizing its playful design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the character display a playful or exaggerated facial expression (e.g., wide eyes, smile, raised eyebrows) that enhances charm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are blurred, making it impossible to determine the expression. However, given the chibi style, it's likely that the character would have a playful or exaggerated expression, but the image does not allow us to confirm this due to the blurring.",
