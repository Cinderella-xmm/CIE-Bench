    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly presents a serpent-shaped creature that is continuous in form, unlike the individual beads seen in Image A which are in several clustered strands. The continuity of the serpent shape is visually evident with a defined head and tail, showing a fluid motion typical of a serpent's body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a serpent body with distinct red and yellow patterns. These patterns mimic the scaliness often associated with snakes in art, providing texture and visual interest focused along the undulating body of the serpent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the serpent have two blue circular features positioned as eyes at its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two blue circular elements are positioned at the head area of the serpent, resembling eyes. This is in contrast to Image A, where blue features are randomly distributed across beads, indicating that these are now specifically used to represent eye details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black motifs arranged as detailed, tribal-style patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited serpent in Image B exhibits black motifs arranged in a manner consistent with tribal design, running along the serpentine figure. These add an intricate decorative element typical of tribal art, creating depth and enhancing the visual texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s tail extend into a long, thin, flowing form with small, dangling bead-like tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the serpent in Image B extends into a tapering end, contrasting with the more uniform beads in Image A. The use of small bead-like shapes at the tail implies movement and the essential slenderness observed in stylized art forms of serpent tails.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are only the original colors (red, yellow, blue, black) used in the serpent, with no additional or unrelated colors introduced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of red, yellow, blue, and black are consistently preserved from Image A. These form the primary color scheme of the serpent, with no new colors introduced, maintaining color harmony and thematic consistency.",
