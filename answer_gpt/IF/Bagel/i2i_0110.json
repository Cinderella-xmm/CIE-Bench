        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase with sunflowers is positioned on a white table with clean, sleek lines, which is consistent with modern kitchen dining table design. The presence of modern stools further supports the interpretation that this scene is set in a kitchen dining area.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wall with large slatted blinds, and there are strips of light that suggest sunlight filtering through these blinds. This is typical of venetian blinds which can control the amount of light entering a room. The visual effect of light stripes is indicative of sunlight through such blinds.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the modern setting in Image B, the vase with sunflowers remains prominently positioned in the center of the image, drawing the viewer's attention. The size and vibrancy of the flowers compared to the rest of the scene ensure they continue to be the primary focus.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, the presence of a sleek, white table and modern stools, along with the controlled light effect through venetian blinds, suggests a contemporary kitchen setting. These elements are characteristic of modern interior design found commonly in kitchens.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows striped patterns of light and shadow on the table and floor, which are common effects when sunlight streams through slatted blinds. These visual cues indicate the presence of light modulation characteristic of blinds filtering sunlight.",
