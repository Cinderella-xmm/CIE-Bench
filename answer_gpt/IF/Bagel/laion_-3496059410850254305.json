      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is held by a humanoid character with mechanical or armored limbs. The guitar does not appear to be transformed into an armored torso.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body has a more illustrated and comic-like appearance. It does not exhibit a realistic, metallic, deep mahogany finish with visible reflective qualities.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is seen with a cape-like piece of clothing, but it is not described as luminous or containing sound wave motifs. The headstock does not feature a bright emblem related to sound waves. The emphasis is more on the character's visual design rather than incorporating such specific thematic elements.",
