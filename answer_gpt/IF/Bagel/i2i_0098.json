      "question": "Is the mirror still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, an analysis shows the wall features artwork instead of a mirror. The typical rectangular reflective glass of a mirror is absent and replaced by an object resembling fabric art. Common sense tells us that mirrors reflect, and this object does not exhibit reflective qualities, indicating the mirror's absence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the area previously occupied by the mirror been replaced with a minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region above the sink, previously occupied by a mirror, now features wall art depicting a simplistic design with layered colors resembling landscapes. This visual change suggests the area is now holding the wall art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the minimalist landscape wall art appear to have a fabric canvas material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall art displays texture indicative of fabric canvas material. The edges and surface have a textured appearance typical of natural fabric materials, supporting the idea of it being canvas-based.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have any other parts of the bathroom, such as the sink, vase, lights, or tiles, been altered unintentionally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "A direct comparison between Image A and Image B shows that the sink, vase, lights, and tiles are unchanged; the only modified area is where the mirror was. This suggests only the mirror replacement has occurred without other alterations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Are there any additional elements or changes in the image beyond removing the mirror and replacing it with a minimalist landscape wall art on a fabric canvas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the sole modification is the substitution of the mirror with wall art, consistent with the provided changes. No additional elements or alterations are evident, confirming the scope of changes is restricted to this area.",
