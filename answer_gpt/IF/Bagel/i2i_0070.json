      "question": "Is the background showing an African savanna scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a vast, open landscape with flat terrain, sparsely scattered trees, and shrubs. This is characteristic of a savanna environment, typical of African landscapes. The type of trees visible further suggests an African savanna, as they resemble acacia trees often found in such regions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is depicted as dark with a starry backdrop, which is generally indicative of nighttime. The presence of numerous stars and the deep colors of the sky support the notion that the scene is set during the night.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a prominent, bright band of stars and cosmic dust stretches across the sky, strongly resembling the Milky Way galaxy as it's typically depicted in night sky photography. This is a common representation of the Milky Way, supporting the conclusion that it is visible in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are multiple stars visible alongside the Milky Way in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows numerous individual stars scattered across the sky, in addition to the Milky Way's glowing band. The presence of these stars is consistent with a clear night sky featuring celestial bodies besides the Milky Way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the train and railway tracks appear seamlessly integrated into the savanna background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and railway tracks appear to be placed atop the savanna landscape, but they do not integrate seamlessly. The tracks abruptly stop in the savanna, and the train's alignment and lighting do not fully match the rest of the scene. The transition between the train tracks and the savanna does not appear natural or cohesive.",
