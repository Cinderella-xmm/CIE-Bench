      "question": "Is the background changed to a matte solid gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a consistent, uniform color without any textures, patterns, or variations. This suggests a solid matte finish. In edited images, a solid color often indicates a matte finish as it absorbs light evenly without reflection or gloss.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible gradients or variations in tone that typically characterize shadows. The lighting appears uniform across the entire scene without any apparent directional light causing distinct shadow lines or shades.",

      "question": "Are the banana shape and metal stand curves highlighted effectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shapes of the elephant and the accompanying stand are clearly defined and distinguishable. The curves and outlines are sharp, allowing for clear visibility of their forms despite the monochromatic scheme. Effective highlighting here means that the viewer can easily discern the shapes and contours designed in the image.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a minimalistic design without unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a simplified design focused solely on the elephant and stand, with no additional decor or distractions. Minimalism emphasizes simplicity and function, which the image achieves by keeping only essential elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Considering the minimal use of colors, absence of extraneous details, and focus on form over decoration, Image B embodies minimalistic principles effectively. Such design assets focus on functional elegance, often serving in contexts where less visual complexity is desired.",
