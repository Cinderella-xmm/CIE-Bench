        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a suit with blended colors that mimic watercolor effects. The hues appear to be a mix of blue and other colors, and the edges of the suit seem soft and painterly. This visual texture is indicative of watercolor techniques.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie features a pattern that is different from the pattern observed in Image A. Image A displays a red tie with small dots, while Image B shows a different patterned tie. This confirms the presence of at least two different tie patterns across the images.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "explanation": "Image B does have a book-like frame with visible pages, but it does not explicitly show an album frame with an embossed title, nor is there clear texture and depth suggesting real leather or raised lettering. The frame looks like a digital illustration rather than real leather.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes artistic elements that convey a refined aesthetic, such as watercolor effects and elaborate graphical design. Although it may not fully exhibit satin or leather textures, the use of watercolor brushwork and composition suggests classic elegance.",
