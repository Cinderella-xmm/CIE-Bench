      "question": "Is there a top view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows four different views of the baseball and glove. The second quadrant of the edited image clearly displays a top-down view of a baseball inside a glove, indicating a top view is present. This is derived from the orientation of the glove and baseball, where the open part of the glove faces upwards with the baseball resting inside.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a side view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes multiple views of the baseball and glove arrangement. A side view would typically show the glove and baseball from a lateral perspective, revealing the thickness and depth. The edited image lacks such a view entirely showing the side perspective of both the glove and baseball.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a sectional view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A sectional view typically involves cutting through the object to expose its inner components. None of the quadrants in the edited image display such a feature for the baseball or glove, as all depicted views are external perspectives.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the views of the baseball and glove clear and detailed enough for product catalogs or sports equipment manuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents clear, distinct views of the baseball and glove from various angles, providing adequate detail for each perspective. The lighting and resolution appear sufficient for showcasing the products in a catalog or manual context, with emphasis on the shape and stitching of both items.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors and textures of the baseball and glove accurately preserved in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows distinct orange coloration and texture patterns that typically donâ€™t match real-life baseball gloves, suggesting that color and texture accuracy is not perfectly preserved across the views. The colors appear consistent but may not represent the true appearance of leather in all quadrants.",
