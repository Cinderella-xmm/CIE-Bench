      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is sitting in front of what seems to be a globe. It is visually suggested that the globe serves as a backdrop rather than enclosing the entire scene. This is apparent because the globe's structure does not form a complete enclosure around the figure.",
