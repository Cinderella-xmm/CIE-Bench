    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image display visible, textured brushstrokes across the entire composition, consistent with Impressionist painting techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire composition is rendered with visible, textured brushstrokes. This is characteristic of Impressionist painting techniques, where individual brushstrokes are evident and contribute to the overall visual texture and vibrancy of the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the scene lit with warm, golden-hour lighting suggestive of dusk, with soft shadows and a glowing horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is bright and colorful, but not specifically suggestive of the warm, subdued tones typical of golden-hour or dusk lighting. The use of colors is more vivid and saturated, lacking the soft shadows and the glowing horizon commonly associated with dusk.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the patterns and colors of the subjectâ€™s clothing rendered with thick, visible brushstrokes that exaggerate their vibrancy and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clothing patterns and colors in Image B are depicted with intense vibrancy and clear, visible brushstrokes. The exaggerated color saturation and thickness of the stroke give the clothing a dynamic and textured appearance, emphasizing the artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of soft, blended warm golden hues with no distinct details, creating a hazy, atmospheric effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with vibrant, varied colors and visible brushstrokes that do not blend softly but rather stand out prominently. Unlike what the question suggests, the background is filled with distinct, energetic colors and does not create a hazy, atmospheric effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the drum surface show layered, textured paint application that gives it a three-dimensional, tactile appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drum in Image B does not show a textured paint application typical for imparting a three-dimensional appearance. Instead, the drum is depicted with colorful, flat brushstrokes that lack the distinct layers expected in a tactile, textured depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the grass and trees in the background stylized with flowing or angular forms that visually mirror the rhythmic motion of the drummer?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass and trees are stylized with bold, flowing forms created through dynamic brushstrokes. These forms echo the rhythmic motion of the drummer, imparting a sense of movement and energy to the scene.",
