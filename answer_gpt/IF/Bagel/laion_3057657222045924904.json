      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the McLaren depicted as a highly detailed 3D-rendered model rather than a photographic image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style of the car suggests a computer-generated 3D render rather than a real photograph. This can be inferred from the lack of realistic textures and the smooth, polished surfaces typical of 3D models. Real images often include imperfections and more natural lighting, whereas this image has a more uniform and artificial lighting setup consistent with 3D rendering.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is depicted inside a clear enclosure, likely made of transparent material such as acrylic. This is evidenced by the reflections and the visible edges and corners of the case, which is typical for display cases used to showcase objects while keeping them protected.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car does not appear to be on a polished chrome base. Instead, the car's base features a different material, likely carbon fiber, as suggested by the color and texture, with no indication of a finish resembling polished chrome or a rotating mechanism.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior walls of the display case do not exhibit carbon fiber textures. Instead, the walls appear to have a plain backdrop, which is used to enhance the visual presentation of the car rather than showing intricate material textures.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a miniature toolset visible at the front of the display case. The tools, which look like micro wrenches and screwdrivers, are neatly arranged, indicating a set-up to showcase not just the car, but also related miniature accessories.",
