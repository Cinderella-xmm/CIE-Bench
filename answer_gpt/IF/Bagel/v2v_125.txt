    "Question": "Q2: Do the chibi characters in the stickers have oversized, expressive eyes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style stickers depict characters with significantly larger-than-normal eyes, a characteristic commonly associated with chibi art.

    "Question": "Q3: Does the background of the stickers feature warm, earthy tones along with subtle stars or confetti?",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the aspect ratio of the edited image 9:16?",
