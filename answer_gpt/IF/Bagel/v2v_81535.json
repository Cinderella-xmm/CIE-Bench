      "question": "Have the fresh green cilantro sprigs been replaced with tiny, ornate blue dragons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe that there are small blue dragons intricately placed on top of the cilantro sprigs. They are visually distinct and different from the cilantro observed in Image A. This replacement of the cilantro sprigs with dragon figures can be noticed with careful observation of Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the scales of the blue dragons mirror the delicate blue floral design of the white porcelain bowl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons have blue scales. The porcelain bowl has a blue floral pattern. To determine if the scales mirror the bowl's design, one needs to compare the pattern details. The dragons' scales are similar in color but not in pattern to the floral design; they do not exhibit the same intricacy or floral motifs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the blue dragons shown breathing faint wisps of orange curry-scented smoke?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while small blue dragons have been added, there is no visual indication of them breathing or emitting smoke. There is no artistic rendering of smoke or any related effects visible in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the chicken pieces been transformed into dragon eggs made of shimmering, solidified curry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chicken pieces in Image B retain their form and appearance as in Image A. They have not been altered to appear as dragon eggs, nor do they exhibit any characteristics that suggest a transformation into curry-solidified dragon eggs.",

      "question": "Has the overall composition and context of the original image been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the addition of blue dragons on the cilantro modifies the visual detail, the primary composition—consisting of the chicken curry, cilantro, and bowl—remains largely unchanged. The context as a display of a food dish in the bowl is maintained despite the minor ornamental modifications.",
