      "question": "Does the teddy bear have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear exhibits a geometric design with flat surfaces and angles, characteristic of a low-poly style often used in digital art to create a stylized appearance. This can be determined by observing the angular contours and the use of simplified polygonal shapes on the teddy bear's structure.",

      "question": "Does the motorcycle have a faceted low-poly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the motorcycle in Image B reveals a similar low-poly design to the teddy bear. The motorcycle's body showcases angular characteristics and simplified forms rather than the detailed curves and metallic textures usually seen in realistic objects, indicating a low-poly style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scenic background rendered in a low-poly style while still being recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B, although stylized as a low-poly design, retains enough recognizability to identify key features like the mountain. The use of simplified geometric shapes and varying shades suggests a low-poly style, yet it maintains its resemblance to a typical scenic background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparative analysis indicates that, despite the low-poly transformation, the teddy bear in Image B maintains the same pose and positioning as in Image A. Key elements like the orientation of the arms and the riding posture on the motorcycle remain unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the design has shifted to a low-poly aesthetic, the motorcycle in Image B retains the same general structure and position as in Image A. The wheels, handlebars, and other features are in the same relative positions as before, indicating no change in design or placement.",
