    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house is depicted using vibrant geometric shapes and colors, reminiscent of cubist art, which abstracts and fragmentizes objects. This style is characterized by the use of geometric shapes to represent various angles of an object without realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original brick surfaces of the house replaced with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes rather than realistic masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the house's surface as an assembly of colorful geometric shapes, diverging from realistic masonry. This departure from realism aligns with cubist art which uses dynamic shapes and colors instead of uniform material depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all individuals in the crowd been rendered as abstract, faceless, and scattered forms devoid of detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crowd lacks individual features, replaced by abstract forms using colors and shapes, indicative of a departure from realism. This aligns with the characteristic of cubism, where detailed human representation is transformed into abstract and faceless shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the grass surface feature a visible checkered pattern overlaying the entire green area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the green area with fragmented color blocks resembling a checkered pattern rather than the realism of grass. This is consistent with cubist treatment of surfaces, creating a visual effect using color and geometry rather than actual textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the water reflection been transformed into a series of prismatic, angular shards that distort and fragment the image of the house and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water reflection is represented using dynamic, angular shards, distorting the reflection of the house. This style aligns with cubist treatment where reflections can be represented as fragmented and abstract components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
