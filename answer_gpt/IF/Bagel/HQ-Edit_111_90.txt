    "Question": "Q1: Is the necklace and snake tail enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is encapsulated within a transparent glass dome. Encased within it, we observe elements such as an ornate object resembling a necklace or chandelier hanging from the dome's peak, a snake, and other decorative elements. The enclosure of these elements within a glass dome is evident from the way the light reflects off the glass surface, creating a boundary that contains the objects within.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the necklace now suspended as a floating chandelier supported by ornate branches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the previously necklace-like object has been transformed into a suspended fixture resembling a chandelier. It is distinctively hanging from the top of the dome, supported by structures that resemble ornate branches.
