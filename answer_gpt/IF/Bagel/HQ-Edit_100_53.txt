    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image feature bold black outlines around figures and objects?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there are distinct thick black outlines present around the major figures and objects, such as the person and pathway objects. This stylistic choice is characteristic of traditional Japanese ukiyo-e art, where outlines define forms and provide a clear separation between elements. These bold outlines are consistent with the hand-drawn aesthetic typical in woodblock prints.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the background include stylized distant rolling hills rendered in a manner consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape compositions?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, stylized distant rolling hills are visible and are consistent with the traditional compositional methods found in ukiyo-e landscapes.
