      "question": "Is the grand piano replaced with a cookie sculpture that retains the same overall shape and structure as the original piano?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, we see a sculpture resembling the shape and structure of a grand piano. While it is crafted from what appears to be cookie-like material indicated by the texture and color, it retains the recognizable curves and form of a grand piano. Image A contains a traditional grand piano with the same overall shape and structure. Thus, even though the material is different, the shape and structure are retained.",

      "question": "Is the surface of the piano sculpture uniformly colored in a rich caramel hue instead of glossy black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the piano sculpture has a rich caramel hue, typical of baked cookies, rather than the glossy black of a traditional piano. This contrasts with Image A, which shows a glossy black piano. The uniformity of the caramel color throughout the piano sculpture confirms this observation.",

      "question": "Are there visible white and gold icing designs on the cookie piano that replicate the ornate details of the original piano?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cookie sculpture with elaborate white icing designs covering its surface, resembling ornate detailing. While Image A features the intricate and ornamented surroundings of a luxurious concert hall, the piano itself is plain black without such icing decorations. Thus, while there are icing decorations on the cookie, they do not replicate features from the original piano itself.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the piano keys made of embedded sugar crystals rather than solid black or white material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keys in Image B appear to be a part of the cookie material without any indication of embedded sugar crystals. Instead, they likely have a design with icing or color application to represent keys. Conversely, Image A has keys made from solid material typical of real pianos, although this does not apply directly as Image B doesn't depict sugar crystals.",

      "question": "Is the cookie piano positioned on a plain white marble tabletop, devoid of any surrounding stage, audience, or theater elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano is positioned on a white marble tabletop, clearly distinct from any stage or theater elements, which is indicative of a more minimalistic presentation compared to the intricate and grand setting in Image A, surrounded by ornate details and a theater environment.",
