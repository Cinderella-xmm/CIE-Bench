    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the chalets now made of crystalline ice with visible frosted spires and snowflake-patterned walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure depicted is a castle-like building with spires rather than the wooden chalets visible in Image A. The structure in Image B appears to be made of ice, featuring visible frosted spires and walls adorned with snowflake patterns, which aligns with the description of a crystalline ice building.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the pine trees been transformed into towering ice sculptures with delicate icicle branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no pine trees visible, as the entire scene is dominated by the ice castle and its surroundings. Image A, on the other hand, shows clearly visible pine trees. Therefore, Image B does not depict pine trees transformed into ice sculptures.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the ground been replaced with a shimmering, glowing ice surface rather than regular snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B appears to be an icy surface with a reflective and shimmering quality, which contrasts with the snow-covered landscape in Image A. This suggests the ground has been replaced with an ice-like surface in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are swirling auroras visible in the sky above the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky features visible, swirling auroras creating a prominent visual element above the ice castle. In contrast, Image A shows a moonlit sky without any auroras. This indicates that Image B includes auroras in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene convey a cohesive, fantastical, and dreamlike winter realm through the integration of crystalline structures, glowing ice, ice sculptures, and auroras?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines elements such as a crystalline ice castle, a shimmering ice surface, and swirling auroras, creating a fantastical and dreamlike winter scene. These elements, absent from the more realistic winter landscape of Image A, contribute to the fantastical atmosphere.",
