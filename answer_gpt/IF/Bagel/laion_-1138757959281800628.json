      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire hotel and pool scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene resembles a miniature model due to the toy-like representations and exaggerated elements such as cartoonish clouds and stylistic interpretations of vegetation. However, upon examining the image, there is no visible glass or terrarium-like enclosure surrounding the hotel and pool scene. The scene appears open to the contextual environment, consistent with how such models are often depicted for aesthetic purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the pool display layered water effects, such as visible depth layers or textured surface ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool is visually transformed into a model-like representation. The water in the pool has a stylized, smooth appearance, typical of a dollhouse or diorama representation, lacking complex depth layers or realistic textured surface ripples.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sunbathers and surrounding trees visibly miniaturized in size relative to the building and pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both sunbathers and trees appear significantly smaller and more simplified than one would expect in a realistic setting, and their proportion relative to the hotel and pool suggests that the entire scene is designed to look like a miniature model. This is evidenced by the exaggerated scale of the building and the use of toy-like figures and elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there fabricated cascading greenery visibly growing from the rooftop of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable addition of greenery cascading from the rooftops and sides of the hotel, which appears to be deliberately stylized to enhance the miniaturized diorama effect. This greenery is not typical and seems artificial, aiming for an aesthetic impact common in elaborate models.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are small, whimsical beach accessories (e.g., toy floats, tiny buckets, or miniature umbrellas) placed near the edge of the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are elements around the pool area that appear to be small and whimsical, akin to toy floats and tiny beach accessories. These features are consistent with the apparent theme of a stylized miniature scene, adding a playful and imaginative dimension to the presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there floating 3D cloud elements positioned above the scene, distinct from the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are cloud-like structures that are distinctly three-dimensional and appear to float above or around the hotel. These clouds are separate from any realistic sky background and contribute to the overall whimsical, diorama-like atmosphere.",
