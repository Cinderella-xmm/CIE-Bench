      "question": "Does the edited image show a single humanoid figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a man is visible wearing white clothing and beside him is a brown Highland cow with distinct long horns and fur. Therefore, there are two distinct figures: a human and an animal, hence, combining this visual information, the image does not show a single humanoid figure.",

      "question": "Are the cow's horns visible on the humanoid figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow next to the man has pronounced horns that are part of the Highland cow. There's no humanoid figure associated with these horns; they are inherent to the cow. Thus, based on the visual separation between the human and the cow, the humanoid figure does not have the horns.",

      "question": "Does the humanoid figure have fur resembling that of a cow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow has distinct long, reddish-brown fur. The man, on the other hand, is wearing a white coat and has no cow-like fur. Therefore, the humanoid figure does not have fur resembling that of the cow.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man appears to be wearing a white coat similar to what is commonly seen on animal handlers or farmers at agricultural shows. This matches the clothing worn by the man in Image A. Thus, the humanoid figure retains the man's original clothing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's posture remains unchanged with him holding the rope and walking beside the cow, similar to Image A. The posture of holding the rope and body orientation towards the animal is typical in animal shows and indicates the posture is consistent.",
