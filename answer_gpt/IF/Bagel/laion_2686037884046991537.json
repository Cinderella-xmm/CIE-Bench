      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image formatted as a two-panel comic with the title \"The Whoopie Pie Chronicles\" displayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of four panels featuring a cartoon-style comic. There is no visible title such as 'The Whoopie Pie Chronicles.' The panels depict a conversation between characters, but no title is present above or within the frames.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the whoopie pies have cartoon-style facial expressions (eyes, mouths) and limbs to represent them as expressive characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pies are given cartoon-style treatments with eyes, a mouth, and limbs, allowing them to convey expressions and actions. These features are common in cartoons to anthropomorphize objects, making them expressive characters.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chocolate tops and creamy centers still clearly visible and used as the primary shapes for the characters’ heads and bodies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate tops and creamy centers are visible and form the basis for the heads and bodies of the whoopie pie characters. The main shape of the whoopie pies, with their tops and centers, is retained to form the basis of these characters’ anthropomorphic features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a playful kitchen scene with recognizable kitchen elements (e.g., stove, sink, utensils)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes elements like part of a kitchen counter and a stove, suggesting a kitchen environment. While not detailed or overly playful, these elements mark out a kitchen scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "In the first panel, are two whoopie pie characters positioned on the edge of the plate, looking over with curious expressions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first panel depicts one whoopie pie character and a green anthropomorphic character (likely a frog), but they do not have observable expressions indicating curiosity. Instead, the green character is taking a bite, and no two whoopie pies are displayed exploring or looking over the edge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the speech bubbles do not contain the specified text. Instead, it features text in a humorous, intentionally misspelled style. The provided content does not match 'I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!'",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question": "In Panel 2, does one whoopie pie character hold a kitchen spatula like a sword and appear to lead forward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the green anthropomorphic character holds what appears to be a kitchen implement. However, the whoopie pie character itself does not hold a spatula or any implement and does not appear to lead forward, as the question suggests.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the text does not match 'To the minty mountains!' Instead, the phrasing is humorously misspelled, consistent with the comic style, and does not clearly state those words.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are outlined with bold, thick lines typical of cartoon illustrations. They are filled with flat colors, consistent with a simple cartoon style, without gradients or complex shading.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubbles are written in a style resembling a handwritten font, with consistent appearance across the panels. However, the text is intentionally misspelled and playful, impacting legibility to some extent.",
