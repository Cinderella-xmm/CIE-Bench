      "question": "Is the edited image divided into three distinct panels arranged as a manga page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is visually structured into three separate sections with each containing different actions of the girl character, similar to a typical manga layout. This division into sections or panels is a common feature in manga to depict a sequence of actions or events.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 show a close-up of the girl's intense eyes and her hand gripping the katana?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 in the edited image shows the girl in a close-up action pose with fiery hair but does not focus specifically on her eyes or a hand gripping the katana. The focus appears to be more on her movement and stance rather than a detailed close-up of eyes and hand.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the girl in Panel 1 display a determined facial expression (e.g., narrowed eyes, firm mouth)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial expression of the girl in Panel 1, disregarding the blurred part, appears to be one of action or intensity, commonly associated with determination. However, without complete visibility, confirming narrowed eyes or a firm mouth expression is speculative.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Panel 1 contains speech within speech bubbles to indicate dialogue, a common feature in manga. However, the text does not state the exact sentence “I will rise beyond the phoenix blaze,” as it contains altered text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 shows dynamic action with the girl moving forward and what appears to be fiery trails aligning with her hair, indicating motion and energy. Her expression seems intense but the image does not clearly show a smirk expression.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Panel 2 contains speech bubbles as part of the storytelling technique of manga. However, the speech bubbles do not contain the text “No challenge too fierce!” in exact words.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Does Panel 3 show the girl standing with the katana pointing forward and colorful energy swirling around her, displaying a triumphant and confident expression?",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 3 in the edited image does indeed contain a speech bubble with a very similar phrase “Witness my true power!” indicating that a part of the text may match exactly the given phrase.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All panels in the edited image use strong, vivid color contrasts for backgrounds reminiscent of energetic and dramatic settings, which enhance the dynamic nature of the scene, a common manga artistry technique.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of bold outlines in Image B is noticeable and serves the typical manga style effect of emphasizing characters during action scenes, thus enhancing the perception of movement and focus.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the panels in the edited image are designed to fit within a manga-like page, the aspect ratios are not individually evident but are assumed to be consistent for visual coherence; from observation they do not appear explicitly designed to match 3:4 ratios.",
      "weight": 1,

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible text or title like “Flame’s Journey to Glory” present at the top of the edited image (Image B), which primarily focuses on action without noticeable title presentation.",
