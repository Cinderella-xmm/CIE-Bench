      "question": "Does the kite have a design that resembles or suggests it could be made as a paper craft model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kites have a simplistic design with distinct shapes and lines, resembling models cut from paper, particularly the yellow kite with its clear geometric shape and defined edges. These characteristics are typical for paper craft models. The presence of structured lines and a simple color scheme supports the idea that they could be designed as paper crafts.",

      "question": "Are the colors used for the kite vibrant and suitable for representing cultural significance on a postcard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is depicted in a bright yellow, a color often associated with vibrancy, happiness, and positivity. These attributes make it suitable for representing cultural significance, especially in contexts where bright colors symbolize festivity and celebration. Consequently, this makes the kite an appropriate subject for a culturally significant postcard.",

      "question": "Is the kite prominently featured in the image, with minimal distracting elements around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow kite is prominently displayed with clear and simple surroundings consisting of minimal background elements, which keeps the focus on the kite itself. This lack of clutter ensures that the kite is the main point of interest in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the structural details of the kite, such as its frame and tail, well-defined and clear enough to suggest it could be crafted from paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B displays well-defined structural details, including clearly outlined edges, a visible frame, and an attached tail. These characteristics are common in crafting paper kites, where each component must be distinctly cut and assembled. Therefore, the clarity in the kite's structure suggests that it could be crafted from paper.",
