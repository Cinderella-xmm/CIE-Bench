    "Question": "Q5: Is the sky composed of a swirling, pastel-colored patchwork quilt pattern rather than a natural twilight sky?",
    "explanation": "The sky in Image B deviates significantly from a naturally occurring twilight sky. Instead, it manifests a swirling, pastel patchwork pattern that suggests a whimsical, dream-like canvas.

This maintains the compositional layout even with the dramatic environmental changes.",
