      "question": "Is the woman's head significantly larger than her body, consistent with a cartoon-style character design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's head is designed to be disproportionately larger compared to her body, which is common in cartoon-style characterizations to emphasize certain features and create a playful aesthetic. Cartoons often exaggerate head sizes for stylistic purposes. In comparison to Image A, where the head is proportionate to the body, Image B deliberately enlarges the head for the cartoon effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red boots clearly visible and unchanged in color and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red boots are prominently depicted with a consistent shape and color, matching the visual style of cartoon-like representation. The boots maintain their bright red color and the distinct form as seen in Image A, without modifications. This indicates a deliberate replication of the boots maintaining their visual integrity.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the character have bold black outlines surrounding its entire form, suggesting a soft rubber toy aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features bold black outlines around the entire character, a characteristic commonly used in designs for toys or animated figures that are meant to appear robust and sturdy, such as rubber toys. These outlines help define the character's shape distinctively, which is a departure from the realistic depiction in Image A that lacks such outlines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the character depicted in an exaggerated bending-over pose, with her torso angled downward toward her legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's pose is exaggerated with the torso bent downward sharply, resembling comedic or animated style poses often used to create drama or emphasize movement in animation. This exaggerated pose is reflective of the stance seen in Image A but enhanced for visual effect in the cartoon version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a silver-colored metal keyring visibly attached to the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a silver-colored metal keyring is visibly attached at the top of the character's head, indicating its function as a keychain. This feature is absent in Image A, where the depiction does not include such accessories, reinforcing the transformation into a practical, everyday object.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background composed of neutral-toned wooden planks, without any elements of water, sky, or boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly features a background of neutral-toned wooden planks, serving as a plain backdrop to emphasize the character design without distractions. In contrast, Image A includes a complex background comprising elements like water, sky, and a boat, which are intentionally omitted in Image B for simplicity and focus on the keychain character.",
