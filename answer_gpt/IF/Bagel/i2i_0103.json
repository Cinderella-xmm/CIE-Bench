      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image showcases pronounced, exaggerated brushstrokes that are consistent and visible throughout the entire composition. This aligns with the distinct style of post-impressionist artwork, particularly reminiscent of Van Gogh's technique, where brushstrokes are purposefully dynamic and visible. Such brushwork is not just a detail but a central component of the aesthetic of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there distinct, exaggerated differences between light and dark areas in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays vivid contrasts between light and dark areas, creating a bold sense of depth and dimension. This effect is characteristic of Van Gogh's work, where he often used high contrast to direct focus and create visual drama. The swirling pattern and color choice further accentuate these differences, making them appear more exaggerated compared to a more realistic lighting approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elements within the edited image, such as the sky, clouds, and landscape, display swirling patterns or dynamic lines characteristic of Van Gogh's style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) extensively features swirling patterns and dynamic outlines, especially visible in the sky, clouds, and landscape elements. These swirling motions are highly indicative of Van Gogh's signature brushwork and style, notably similar to his famous piece 'The Starry Night'. Such patterns give the image a fluid, almost animated quality.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is transformed into one that is extremely vibrant and expressive, with high-contrast yellows, blues, and greens dominating the scene. These colors deviate significantly from naturalistic tones, capturing the emotional expression and amplified color vibrancy characteristic of Van Gogh's art.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Every aspect of the edited image (Image B) adheres to the stylistic approach reminiscent of Van Gogh's techniquesâ€”visible brushstrokes, swirling lines, vivid color contrasts, and emotional vibrancy. The transformation affects all elements, ensuring a consistent homage to Van Gogh's distinctive and easily recognizable style.",
