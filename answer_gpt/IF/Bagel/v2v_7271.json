      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the laundromat and the person holding laundry, depicted using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is crafted to replicate the look of a Lego construction. The walls and the exterior of the laundromat feature the characteristic brick pattern typical in Lego set designs. The person and the laundry are also styled as Lego minifigures and pieces, with solid colors and Lego-specific detailing. This visual style is consistent with how scenes are created in a Lego model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the person and the folded laundry represented as Lego figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the person in the image is transformed into a Lego minifigure, evident by the blocky structure, the minimized anatomical details, and the stylized hairpiece. The folded laundry is depicted using simple, solid-colored Lego brick shapes, matching the general Lego aesthetic of solid forms without intricacies.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the laundromat environment, including the walls, doors, and washing machines, constructed using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laundromat’s environment clearly makes use of Lego elements—walls with aligned bricks, doors mimicking the structure of Lego pieces, and simplified shapes for washing machines are indicative of a Lego-built setting, using typical Lego design principles of modularity and minimalism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the scene have a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire design in Image B appears to be captured as a diorama, common in stop-motion animation. Lego arrangements usually have this constructed, static quality due to their interlocking nature and fixed positioning unless rearranged physically.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the overall scene composition been maintained while adapting it to the Lego aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination, Image B retains the essential elements and composition of the original scene, such as the positioning of the laundromat sign, the placement of the figure holding laundry, and the general architectural features of the laundromat, albeit adapted into a Lego style.",
