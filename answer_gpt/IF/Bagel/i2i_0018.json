      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower is drawn in a simplified, cartoonish manner, emphasizing uniform lines and stylized features typical of many cartoon illustrations. The structure appears vertically stretched, and its geometric form is more pronounced than in a realistic depiction. This kind of exaggeration is common in stylized illustrations, where features are often elongated or emphasized to simplify and abstract the original form.",

      "question": "Does the edited version include a base of colorful geometric flowerbed rings around the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the clock tower is surrounded by colorful circular shapes that represent a flowerbed. These shapes are geometric and stylized, aligning with the typical pattern of colorful blocks often seen in cartoon-style illustrations. This symbolizes the colorful flowerbeds present in the real-world depiction through abstract forms.",

      "question": "Does the overall structure of the edited image appear as a vertical metal badge with a glossy enamel coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B features heavy, bold outlines and flat areas of color, characteristic of designs that might be used in enamel badges. These features, combined with the clean and simplified aesthetic, suggest a design reminiscent of a metal badge. However, the description does not explicitly show glossiness typical for enamel. Assuming a generalization based on style similarities common in such illustrations, the image could plausibly be interpreted as resembling a metal badge.",

      "question": "Is the edited image displayed on a white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the stylized tower illustration positioned against a plain, white background. This choice of background emphasizes the cartoon-style design and helps the colored, detailed portion stand out. A white background is common for clean presentations, particularly in graphic design and illustration.",

      "question": "Has the clock tower and flowerbed been illustrated in a chibi-style, with simplified and cartoonish features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B shows the tower and flowerbed with exaggerated, simplified features which is characteristic of a chibi style. This style often involves cartoonish depictions with bold outlines and minimalist details, focusing on a cute and playful representation of original subjects. In this case, the clock tower's structure and the colorful flowerbed below it fit these criteria, indicating a chibi-style illustration.",
