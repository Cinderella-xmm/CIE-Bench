      "question": "Does the elephant appear as a 3D chibi-style desktop figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant has a distinctly cartoonish, exaggerated appearance typical of a chibi-style design, which is characterized by a large head, small body, and cute facial features.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant figurine is shown with grass in its mouth, which suggests it's in an eating pose. Comparing this to Image A where the elephant is also in an eating posture, we can confirm that the edited image retains the original pose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B has a matte finish, typical of polymer clay, and the clear dome covering it suggests the use of transparent acrylic, common materials for such decorative items. This appearance confirms the described materials.",
