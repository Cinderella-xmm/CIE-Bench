      "question": "Are the cheetah figures replaced with gold-finished perfume bottles that maintain their original seated poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects flanking the center are two gold-finished perfume bottles with a vertical, cylindrical shape typical of perfume containers. They are not in seated poses like cheetah figures; their form is distinctly different and immobile. By analyzing this change in Image B, we can ascertain that the objects no longer represent cheetah figures but perfume bottles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the botanical center been replaced with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade that has a cascading downward appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible central structure that appears as a translucent, green-tinted glass façade, which suggests a geometric design akin to cascading glass. The visual impression in Image B supports the notion that the original botanical design from Image A has been replaced with this as a center piece.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" present on the bases of both objects in a chic serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the text 'Savanna' appears clearly on both the perfume bottles and the central glass structure. However, 'Essence' is only present on the central piece, not on the bases of both perfume bottles. The font style is chic, but the positioning of 'Essence' is not consistent with both bases.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image convey an elegant and luxurious aesthetic consistent with a high-end retail perfume display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of gold-finished bottles and a central glass facade in Image B aligns with the typical design choices seen in luxury perfume displays. The design elements, including the use of shiny gold finishes and transparent glass, contribute to an elegant and upscale aesthetic. This choice in materials and context within the perfume industry leads to the inference that the edited image carries a sophisticated vibe.",

    {

      "question": "Are the two gold-finished perfume bottles symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade, preserving the original spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two gold-finished perfume bottles placed symmetrically on either side of the central translucent glass facade. This arrangement mirrors the symmetry seen in Image A that originally held the cheetah figures, hence preserving the spatial balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a reflective surface beneath the objects showing clear reflections of the perfume bottles and central façade?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, there isn't an indication of a reflective surface beneath the objects. However, the overall presentation does not include clear reflections visible of the perfume bottles or the central glass façade. Thus, we can conclude that such reflections are absent in Image B.",
