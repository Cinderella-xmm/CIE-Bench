      "question": "Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse has a shiny, glossy appearance typical of glass, with clear outlines and a light reflection that is consistent with a material like glass rather than soft plush fabric. The entire body of the seahorse in Image B has this characteristic glass appearance. Based on world knowledge, glass has a reflective and polished finish, unlike plush materials which have a more matte and soft look. Therefore, this indicates that the seahorse in Image B is made from glass material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse have a translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the seahorse with a pink coloration that appears translucent, as it allows some light to pass through but not completely transparent, a quality often found in certain types of glass art. Additionally, there are subtle variations that could represent bubble textures, which are often intentionally left in artistic glasswork to enhance visual appeal. Considering the world knowledge that glass objects sometimes have small bubbles or inclusions as part of their design, the observation of such characteristics indicates the presence of these features.",

      "question": "Is the belly section made of opaque yellow glass with an etched music note design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the belly area of the seahorse has a yellow hue with no transparency, which is consistent with opaque glass. However, instead of an etched design, the music note appears to be part of the color pattern within the glass itself, typical of glasswork where colored sections are integral to the glass piece. Opaque glass is non-transparent, and the idea of an etching is not visually supported as it seems to be part of the design rather than an actual etching process.",

      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins made of lavender-colored glass instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ribbons in Image B appear to be smooth, with a consistent reflection and color that aligns with how glass is depicted rather than the textured, pliable nature of fabric seen in Image A. The lavender color is present, and The whole embellishment maintains a solid, structured form appropriate for glass rather than the flexibility typically associated with fabric. Therefore, they are indeed made of glass.",

      "question": "Is the seahorse placed on a reflective black display stand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the seahorse mounted on a shiny black display stand that has a mirrored surface. This kind of stand is often used to showcase art pieces, particularly those made of glass, to enhance their visibility by reflecting light. World knowledge indicates that reflective black surfaces are utilized to draw attention to the object displayed by providing a clean, contrasting backgroundâ€”which is precisely what can be observed here.",
