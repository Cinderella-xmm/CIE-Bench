        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects leaning against the rock in the snow are clearly skis, not footwear. They're modified with new patterns, but their form remains consistent with their original use as skis. Similarly, at the front, there are two hockey sticks with wooden handles. There are no visual elements in Image B that suggest a redesign into footwear.",

      "question": "Are the vivid patterns from the original skis and hockey sticks incorporated into the new footwear design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features modified skis with bold, graphic patterns in red, black, and cream colors. Without reference to Image A, these skis appear to be primarily aesthetic objects rather than footwear. Since they are not redesigned into wearable footwear, the skis remain as sporting equipment, and thus, their vivid patterns are not part of any footwear design.",

      "question": "Are the wooden textures from the hockey sticks incorporated into the new footwear design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hockey sticks are identifiable as such due to their wooden shaft and traditional bent blade design. No design transformation into footwear is apparent; they remain in their original form. Thus, no wooden textures from these sticks are featured in any new footwear design, as none exists.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the new footwear exhibit an imaginative form that reflects the original designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As previously analyzed, Image B still displays the objects as skis and hockey sticks, not footwear. There is no indication of footwear present in the image. Consequently, there is no possibility for an imaginative form of footwear reflecting original ski and hockey stick designs because such a transformation or redesign into footwear has not occurred.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects visible in Image B are skis and hockey sticks that have not been repurposed as footwear. Instead, the emphasizes are on their original structures and materials, including wood for the hockey sticks. Hence, no unconventional materials are applied in any footwear design, as there is no new footwear design present.",
