    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the title \"Desert Adventure Chronicles\" displayed at the top or in a prominent location of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display the title 'Desert Adventure Chronicles.' The top section of the image does not contain any title; instead, each panel has its own dialogue or visual elements. Thus, there is no prominent display of such a title in the comic strip.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly three separate panels arranged horizontally or vertically in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows four separate panels organized in a 2x2 grid rather than being arranged purely horizontally or vertically. This analysis is based on noting the distinct borders separating each scene within the comic, creating four clear sections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the green van in Panel 1 have its roof tilted upward slightly, resembling a hat tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the green van is depicted with a roof shaped like a large green hat. The roof is not just slightly tilted upward; it appears fixed and integrated with the van as a distinctive, oversized hat shape, contributing to the comic's whimsical theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text bubble in Panel 1 containing the words “Ah, the open road calls!” clearly visible and correctly spelled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, the text bubble is clear and visible, but the text is not correctly spelled. It appears scrambled and reads 'A, H, H THE ADVDEED A,, MLL DIERTENS!!' instead of 'Ah, the open road calls!' indicating a playful or stylistic alteration possibly intended for humor.",

      "question": "Are the headlights of the van in Panel 2 significantly wider or brighter than in other panels, indicating surprise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headlights in Panel 2 of Image B do not appear wider or notably brighter than in other panels. Visual emphasis on headlights to indicate surprise is not present; instead, surprise is shown through text and water imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the cactus is depicted with water flowing from its top, resembling a fountain-like structure. The visual transformation from cactus to a structure with a water spout is clear, contributing to the scene's fantastical element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3, the van is shown near the cactus fountain, but it's not clear that it is parked; rather, it appears to be approaching. There are no visible droplets or significant water splashing around the van in the image, focusing more on the cactus and water.",
      "weight": 1,

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 3 features green plants or bushes around the fountain-like cactus, which serves as the oasis. The presence of these plants is clear, providing context that this is a lush spot in the desert environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B consisting of a grid of four panels does not visually support a three-to-one width-to-height ratio. Instead, the image maintains a more balanced, roughly square shape rather than being elongated horizontally.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B maintain a warm and cartoonish style with vibrant colors. Image B uses similar desert tones and an overall playful appearance that aligns with the style of Image A, despite being a comic strip.",
