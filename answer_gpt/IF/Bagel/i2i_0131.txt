    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image include the front, left side, and top views of both refrigerators?",
    "explanation": "The edited image depicts two refrigerators from the front with a slight angle, giving a partial side view but not a full left side view, and there is no visibility of the top view. Typically, for a full top view, the image would need to be captured from above, and for a full left side view, the refrigerators would need to be oriented completely sideways, neither of which are present in the edited image. Thus, it only shows the front with a slight perspective of the left side, not fulfilling the requirement for all three views.",
