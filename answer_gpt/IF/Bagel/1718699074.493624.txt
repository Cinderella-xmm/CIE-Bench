    "Question": "Q1: Has the central structure been replaced with a digital billboard featuring luminous panels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure is characterized by glowing blue panels and a design that suggests it's a high-tech installation. This contrasts with the concrete-like material seen in Image A, suggesting the structure in Image B is meant to resemble a digital billboard with luminous characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible dynamic neon animations on the digital billboard surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the central structure with bright blue luminous areas that give the appearance similar to digital displays. However, there is no clear visual indication of animations; the neon colors could be static. Therefore, based on the image, there are no visible animations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the natural overgrowth been replaced with synthetic, glowing foliage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage at the base of the structure is glowing green, which is distinct from the natural overgrowth seen in Image A. This transition from natural to synthetic glowing elements suggests an intentional replacement to fit a more futuristic theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original architectural angles and structural geometry preserved in the transformed structure?",
    "explanation": "Both images display a similar geometric shape of the central structure, retaining its overall form and angles, despite the change in materials and design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the surrounding buildings feature metallic facades and visible augmented reality elements such as holograms or digital overlays?",
    "explanation": "Image B's surrounding buildings have a modern, futuristic look with their sleek, metallic facades, suggesting advanced technology in their design. However, there are no visible holograms or obvious digital overlays indicated in the buildings themselves.",
    "answer": "No"
