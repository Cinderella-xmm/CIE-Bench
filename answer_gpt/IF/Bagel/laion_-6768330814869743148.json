      "question": "Are the pastries depicted with exaggerated, bright colors and bold outlines characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries are shown with vivid colors like fluorescent yellows, pinks, and other bright hues, accompanied by thick black outlines. This style is a defining characteristic of pop art, where objects are stylized with exaggerated colors and outlines to create an immediate visual impact. This is in contrast to more natural and realistic color representation typically seen in everyday contexts.",

      "question": "Do the bread slices feature bold outlines and vivid, non-naturalistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the bread slices using striking patterns and colors that aren't found in real life, such as checkered patterns in high contrast black and white and bright, unrealistic hues. The colors do not resemble natural bread colors and the addition of bold outlines exaggerates their form. This non-naturalistic representation aligns with an artistic style rather than a realistic depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the muffin liners replaced with distinct geometric patterns such as triangles, squares, or other regular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muffin liners aren't shown as they normally would be, since they feature distinct patterning that looks like interconnected shapes or geometric patterns instead of simple, solid colors or plain, typical muffin papers. This artistic rendition replaces the typical representation with a more abstract design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wooden trays replaced with a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the trays with a simple checkerboard pattern. Rather, it features patterns that are irregular and more abstract, incorporating various bright blocks of color. This differs from a standard checkerboard pattern that typically consists of evenly spaced squares of alternating colors.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the background cups been replaced with abstract, colorful, non-representational shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background area now consists of vibrant and non-representational abstract shapes instead of realistic images of cups. These shapes are colored in various intense hues, demonstrating a shift from a realistic to a more abstract artistic portrayal.",
