    "Question": "Q4: Is there evidence of lighting and shadow depth creating a realistic appearance?",
    "explanation": "Image Bâ€™s lighting and shadows play a key role in creating depth and realism.

    "Question": "Q5: Have the colors and styles of the handwritten notes and highlighted dates been preserved?",
