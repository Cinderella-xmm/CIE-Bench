      "question": "Is the badge made of tassel material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tassel, which is a decorative fringe usually made from loose or tied threads, is depicted hanging from the bottom of the badge. This visual cue suggests that at least part of the badge (specifically the tassel element) could be made of tassel material. While the entire badge is not only composed of tassel material, the presence of the tassel itself justifies an affirmative response to this question.",
