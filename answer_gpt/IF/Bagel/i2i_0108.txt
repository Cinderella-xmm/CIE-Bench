    "Question": "Q2: Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the character as emerging from a three-dimensional background that resembles a television screen. The positioning of the character in front of a rectangular frame, with a clear boundary suggesting a screen, gives the illusion of the character stepping out from it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is holding the shield to the side rather than raising it in front of the body, which would signify a defensive stance. A defensive shield-raising pose typically involves holding the shield in front of the torso to block an attack.",

    "answer": "No"
}
