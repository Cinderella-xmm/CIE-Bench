    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a scene enclosed within a wooden frame that appears to be hand-carved. The visible texture and grain of the wood suggest craftsmanship typical of hand-made frames. These visual cues lead to the conclusion that the image is presented within such a frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the elements - boat, water, and hills - as distinct cutout parts layered to create depth, contrary to a cohesive photograph. These elements are intentionally separate, which is characteristic of layered artwork rather than a photographic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boat in the edited image does not exhibit typical signs of aging such as cracks and weathered surfaces. Instead, it appears smooth, with simpler patterns indicative of a cutout design, suggesting that such textural details are absent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hills are stylized with soft, pastel blue gradients, which deviates from realistic colors often associated with natural landscapes like green or gray hues. This color choice enhances the artistic feel of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes etchings resembling droplet-like shapes above the water, which serves to mimic water ripples as visually distinct from the smooth water surface. These etchings are deliberately placed to suggest motion or texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the boat, water, and hills as distinct layers that add depth to the scene. Each element is positioned to clearly define separation, emphasizing a structured, layered art composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
