      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated features such as large eyes, simplified facial structure, and stylized proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is illustrated with a cartoon or chibi style, characterized by simplified facial structures, larger eyes, and more stylized body proportions compared to realistic depictions.

      "question": "Are the patterns on the girl's kimono exaggerated with flowing, dynamic designs and rendered in significantly brighter, more vivid colors than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono patterns are vivid with bright, clashing colors and bold flower patterns, which are much less intricate and more vibrant compared to realistic or traditional kimono designs. This is in stark contrast to Image A, where the kimono features traditional patterns and colors. The artistic choice in Image B is characteristic of stylized cartoon representations that opt for eye-catching, vibrant colors.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains card titles in a bold, stylized font resembling traditional styles. The text 'Cana Rasp!' at the top of Image B is an example of this, showcasing a playful and decorative font choice that matches the illustrative context of a collectible or greeting card.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is a section at the bottom with some text, suggesting a space that might be similar to those found in cards intended for personal messages. However, there is no clear indicator (like a perforated line) that it is detachable, thereby not definitively fitting the requirement for a detachable personal message area.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed in a rectangular format with clean borders and an organized layout, typical of a postcard or collectible card. The presence of graphics, text, and balanced proportion supports the notion that it is intended for use as a collectible or greeting card. This format is common for printed cards.",
