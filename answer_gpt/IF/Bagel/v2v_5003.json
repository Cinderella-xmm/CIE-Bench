      "question": "Is the bow depicted as a folded origami paper design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow appears to lack the typical wood grain or texture associated with a natural bow. Instead, the surface of the bow seems to be smooth with defined edges, similar to paper. This suggests that it is depicted as an origami paper design. The use of consistent coloration and sharp edges supports this interpretation, as these characteristics are common in paper models.",

      "question": "Are the arrows in the quiver depicted as folded origami paper designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrows in the quiver in Image B have a uniform surface without the usual texture associated with natural materials. The arrowheads have sharp, geometric folds and are identical to each other, resembling folded paper designs rather than real arrows. These visual features suggest that they are depicted as origami paper designs.",

      "question": "Does the woodland backdrop retain its natural appearance without any artificial alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background maintains the look of a forest setting with blurred greenery and foliage. There are no distinct visual elements suggesting artificial manipulation or alteration of the background itself. The natural depth of field and color tones are typical of a real forest scene, implying that the background retains its natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and positioning of the bow and quiver remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the bow and quiver in Image B is similar to Image A. The bow lies diagonally across the foreground, and the quiver stands upright beside it, suggesting that the composition and positioning have remained consistent between the two images. Despite the change in material depiction, the spatial arrangement has not been altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bow and quiver show clear paper folds and lack realistic material textures such as wood or leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the bow and quiver exhibit smooth surfaces with clear, sharp folds typically associated with paper objects, lacking the realistic textures of wood grain or leather seen in Image A. This absence of textural detail that suggests natural materials supports the interpretation that they are depicted as paper folds.",
