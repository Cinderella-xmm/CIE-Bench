      "question": "Is the statue rendered with a matte, textured surface resembling molded clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue appears to have a smooth, uniform surface with a consistent color and a lack of gloss, which is characteristic of a matte finish. The color and texture give an impression similar to molded clay, as it exhibits a distinctive earthy tone and lacks any reflections or shine that would typically be present on glossy materials.",

      "question": "Is the statue enclosed within a large circular glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is clearly depicted within a large circular structure made of a transparent material, which can be logically assumed to be glass, forming a dome-like enclosure around the statue. The curvature and transparency of this structure resemble a glass dome.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom section in Image B shows that the glass dome is placed on a base that has styled, ornamental elements. These elements are typical for a decorative pedestal, with visible patterns enhancing the aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible ornate patterns on the glass dome, including lotus and wave motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the glass dome features intricate designs that appear to be decorative patterns. These include spirals and shapes that could be interpreted as ornate motifs, though they aren't strictly defined as lotus and wave motifs; however, they fit well within such a description.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the trident, snake, and drum illuminated by spotlights that emphasize their golden color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trident, snake, and drum do appear in a golden hue, but there are no visible spotlights specifically emphasizing this coloration. They appear uniformly colored due to the design choice rather than lighting effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the muscular contours of the statue emphasized with detailed and intricate shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue shows emphasized contours of the muscles, suggesting a detailed design that highlights the anatomy. However, the shadowing itself is not highly intricate; instead, the form relies more on the sculpture's shape and the use of lines rather than shadow depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible objects or features that resemble incense holders positioned around the base of the pedestal. The base, while decorative, lacks any small items or structures that could be identified as incense holders.",
