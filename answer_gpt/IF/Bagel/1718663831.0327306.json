      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is clearly represented as a plush stuffed animal. It has a soft, fabric-like appearance with rounded edges, typical of plush toys, and the texture appears to be smooth and cuddly.

      "question": "Does the plush dog retain white fur with sandy-colored spots in the same pattern as the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush dog is predominantly white with specific colored areas, identifiable as brown patches on the ears and feet, rather than sandy-colored spots, which modifies the pattern seen in Image A. The presence of a more uniform color and fewer variations suggests a simplified design typical in plush toys, contrasting with the natural fur pattern of a real dog.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush dog is showcased with what looks like a corset. This corset features visibly placed crystal-like elements that cover the heart-shaped area on its torso.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush dog is situated on a clearly polished, minimalist wooden shelf. The background appears simple and lacks any additional distracting elements, except for a plain wooden texture and lines of shelves.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush dog's paws are resting on the surface of the shelf without any indication of them dangling over the edge. The positioning presents the toy as placed stably rather than precariously, which aligns more with a typical display of stuffed toys.",
