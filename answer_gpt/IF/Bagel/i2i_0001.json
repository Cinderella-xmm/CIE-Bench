      "question": "Is the image showing a close-up view of the keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B suggest that the keychain is being presented in a close-up view. The focus is on the hand holding the keychain with only the keychain and the fingers visible, indicating a close-up shot. Close-up views are typically used to highlight specific details and features of objects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain appear to be made of soft rubber with bold black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain exhibits visual characteristics of soft rubber. The surface texture of the keychain, combined with the clean, sturdy lines, suggests a material that is flexible yet durable. The pronounced black outlines are typical features seen in soft rubber or similar materials to emphasize the contours and features of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain feature a chibi-style representation of the character shown in the attached image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi style is characterized by exaggerated features, typically a larger head and smaller body for an adorable appearance. Image B shows a character with disproportionately large head, round face, and simplified body, matching the essentials of chibi art style. This suggests the keychain has a chibi-style representation of a character.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the keychain attached to a small silver keyring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts the keychain being attached to a metal ring at its top, which appears to be silver. Its size relative to the character and the hand holding it suggests it is small. Silver is a common color used for metal keyrings due to its neutral and classic look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is plain and lacks any complex patterns or vivid colors that cause distraction. Its simplicity serves to emphasize the central object, the keychain, allowing clear focus on the item being showcased.",
