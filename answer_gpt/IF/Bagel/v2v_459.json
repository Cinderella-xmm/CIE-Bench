      "question": "Are the ties depicted as 3D chibi-style objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties have a smooth and shiny surface with exaggerated and vibrant colors, resembling the aesthetic found in chibi-style art, which often portrays objects in a soft, cartoonish, or 3D manner. The visual cues such as the rounded edges and the glossy appearance contribute to this interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the striped and polka dot patterns still vibrant and clearly visible on the 3D chibi-style ties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the striped and polka dot patterns on the ties are clearly defined and appear even more vibrant due to the enhanced color saturation and the chibi-style rendering, which emphasizes brightness and clarity. This ensures the patterns are both bright and visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ties placed inside a realistic drawer setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a setting that resembles a drawer, including the wood grain pattern and the structural elements of a drawer handle and edges. However, the rendering style is consistent with digitized or animated forms, lacking the tactile realism seen in real-world textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ties arranged in a way that suggests they are part of an ornamental display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are neatly placed side by side within the drawer-like setting, giving a sense of order and symmetry typical for a display arrangement. However, the focus on the drawer-like context implies storage rather than an ornamental display setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the original vibrant colors and patterns of the ties been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image A and Image B, it is clear that the original color scheme and patterns of the ties are preserved in the edited version. The bright and distinct stripes and polka dots remain consistent, although Image B enhances these features with more saturation.",
