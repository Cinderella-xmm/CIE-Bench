      "question": "Is the title \"The Nocturnal Observer's Guide\" clearly displayed on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'The Nocturnal Observer's Guide' is shown prominently at the top of the edited image. This section contains a recognizable format in a larger and styled font typical for titles. The title is complete and fully decipherable, indicating that this is the intended name of the guide or book depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding foliage display lush, highly detailed botanical features consistent with a scientific illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surrounding foliage and botanical elements appear detailed in a stylized rather than scientifically accurate manner. While the leaves are clearly depicted and have detail, the style leans more towards a decorative or illustrative graphic, lacking the precision and clarity typical of scientific botanical illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image dominated by earthy tones, particularly highlighting the owl’s brown and cream plumage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features an owl with a focus on browns and creams, which are earthy tones. These colors are prevalent across the owl's feathers and are in harmony with the natural, earthy theme depicted in the image. This suggests that the color palette is intentionally chosen to highlight these aspects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible labels pointing to and identifying the owl’s talons and feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image, there are numerous labels with lines pointing towards different sections of the owl, including the talons and feathers. These labels are indicative of an intent to identify or describe specific features of the owl, which is consistent with observational or educational guides.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a dotted diagram with labeled lunar phases (e.g., waxing gibbous, full moon)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a representation of the moon accompanied by a diagram with dots around it. However, there are no clear labels identifying lunar phases such as 'waxing gibbous' or 'full moon.' Instead, the diagram seems to focus on general features without such labels.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a text box located at the bottom of the image containing a short, descriptive paragraph about owl nocturnal adaptations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the edited image, there is indeed a text box containing a paragraph. However, upon closer examination of the text, it appears to be nonsensical or placeholder text, and does not provide a coherent description of owl nocturnal adaptations.",
