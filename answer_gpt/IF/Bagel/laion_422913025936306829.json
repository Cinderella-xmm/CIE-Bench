      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited shirt design use vibrant, saturated colors typical of pop art rather than subdued or earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt features bright, eye-catching colors like pink, blue, and yellow. These colors are a hallmark of pop art, known for its use of vibrant, saturated hues to attract attention and convey a sense of modernity and dynamism, unlike the earthy tones used in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are large, solid-colored sections used to define the muscular figure’s anatomy, such as chest, arms, and legs, replacing fine shading or gradient effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure’s anatomy is outlined with bold, solid colors without any shading or gradient. This approach is characteristic of pop art, which often simplifies details to stark contrasts and solid blocks of color, differing from the detailed shading seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the edges of the figure and surrounding elements consist of crisp, angular, or straight lines rather than flowing or organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the use of crisp, angular lines for the figure and its surrounding elements, which aligns with the pop art style that favors clear and defined shapes. This contrasts with the more organic and flowing lines of Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the previously subtle or gold-toned patterns now rendered in bright, glowing neon colors such as electric blue, hot pink, or lime green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns that were once gold-toned in Image A have been transformed into bright neon colors like electric blue and hot pink, which are typical of a pop art palette. These colors enhance the vibrancy and energy of the design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has consistent and energetic patterns that are a key element of pop art, contrasting with Image A. The patterns are notably stylized and repetitive, enhancing the dynamic feel of the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the central figure still clearly identifiable as a muscular male figure in a dynamic pose, with arms raised and body angled, even after the stylistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylistic changes in Image B, the central figure remains recognizable as a muscular male figure with his arms raised and body angled in a dynamic pose. The essence of the figure's pose and form is retained in both images, although rendered differently.",
