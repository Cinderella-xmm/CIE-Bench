    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cat and surrounding elements contained within a transparent or framed shadow box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire setup with the cat and its surroundings resembles a diorama or a miniature stage display, which can suggest that it is within a shadow box structure. The presence of a framed appearance, with defined boundaries consisting of curtains and a backdrop, contributes to this impression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible elements of a 3D-rendered vintage theatre, such as a stage, proscenium, or theatrical lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning and design of the elements around the cat bear resemblance to a vintage theatre, complete with a raised platform (mimicking a stage) and ornate, draped curtains, consistent with a proscenium. These features collectively create a theatrical atmosphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the red settee been transformed into a throne-like structure with regal features such as raised back, golden embellishments, or crown motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is seated on a chair that is purposefully designed to resemble a throne: it has an elevated back, golden embellishments, and its overall design implies regality. These elements differentiate it from a conventional settee.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows richly colored curtains on both sides of the scene, which are part of the decoration around the cat. These curtains are in a deep red, contributing to the overall theme of a staged and theatrical setting.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, golden columns are visibly arranged around the cat on the stage-like setup. They are in proportion to the small scene and reinforce the idea of a miniaturized depiction or diorama.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
