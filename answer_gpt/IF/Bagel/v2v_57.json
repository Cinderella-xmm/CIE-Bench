      "question": "Is the art piece oriented vertically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a display case with a LEGO figure standing upright, suggesting a vertical orientation. This implies that the art piece, consisting of the figure within the case, is oriented vertically, as opposed to being laid out horizontally.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figure is clearly visible and prominently positioned within the display case, which is at the center of the image. This arrangement suggests that the LEGO minifigure is intentionally placed at the center for emphasis and balance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a creature next to the LEGO minifigure that has a design combining warm colors like ochre and brown. The attention to detail in its texture, along with its mythical creature-like appearance, suggests a blend of surreal and mythical design elements. This kind of design is common in fantastical or conceptual art.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B transitions from a darker, deep amber color on the left to a lighter, cream tone on the right. This gradient effect creates a visually appealing backdrop that highlights the central items within the glass cube effectively.",
