      "question": "Is the cathedral rendered as a miniature model made of warm-stained wood instead of stone?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest that the cathedral is depicted as a model that appears to be crafted from wood, as seen from its wooden texture and warm colors, which are characteristic of wood material. In contrast, Image A depicts a traditional stone cathedral. This depiction in Image B resembles a crafted wooden structure, different from the stone appearance typically associated with actual cathedrals.",
