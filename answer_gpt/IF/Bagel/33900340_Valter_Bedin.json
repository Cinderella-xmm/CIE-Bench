    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the medieval structure as a colossal stone golem with a humanoid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is transformed into a giant being with a humanoid form, as seen from its two legs, two arms, and facial features. Visual cues, such as symmetry and proportions similar to a humanoid, combined with common knowledge of golems in fantasy, lead to this interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the archways visibly transformed into articulated limbs resembling arms or legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archways are modified to appear as articulated limbs of the stone golem. The arms are positioned lower, suggesting a golem's anatomy in motion, which is different from the stationary archways in Image A, supporting the conclusion of transformation into limbs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the battlements at the top of the structure resemble a crown-like shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the stone golem includes battlements shaped like a crown sitting atop the head-like structure. This transforms the original defensive battlement design into something symbolically evocative of a crown.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are glowing ancient glyphs visible across the surface of the structure, replacing the original wall texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the golem is adorned with ancient glyphs that appear to glow, replacing the original texture of the stone walls from Image A. This is evident from the distinct markings and the appearance of light emanating from them.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stone golem silhouetted against the sky with a mystical aura emanating from its shadowed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem stands out against the sky, but there is no distinct mystical aura around it; instead, it maintains shadowed areas typical of solid structures indicating a lack of effects usually associated with a mystical aura.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the small human figure been replaced by a luminous, ethereal wisp-like entity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original human figure does not appear to be replaced by anything luminous or ethereal. The figure remains a recognizable human form next to a pet, without significant change into a wisp-like entity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible ethereal effects such as soft glows, light particles, or magical ambiance added to the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of glowing glyphs, there are no additional ethereal effects, such as soft glows, light particles, or an all-encompassing magical ambiance that extend beyond these glyphs, suggesting a more static modification.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
