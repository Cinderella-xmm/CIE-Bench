      "question": "Is the perfume bottle constructed entirely out of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is distinctly constructed using Lego bricks, visible from the angular, block-like structure that is characteristic of Lego pieces. This contrasts with the more traditional glass design evident in the original Image A, which uses clear, smooth materials typical of real-life perfume bottles. This Lego construction is evident in the entirety of the bottleâ€™s design, from the base to the cap.",

      "question": "Is the fabric background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a Lego structure with various shapes and colors, displaying a typical blocky and stepped appearance of Lego creations. In contrast, Image A features a smooth, flowing fabric that forms a continuous surface. The use of Lego bricks in Image B changes the texture and visual appearance entirely, indicating the use of block elements instead of smooth fabric.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and positioning of the perfume bottle and fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the composition consists of a perfume bottle on a fabric surface. Image B completely changes both the bottle and background to Lego interpretations, and the chaotic Lego arrangement disrupts the original positioning and composition seen in Image A. Thus, although both images focus on a bottle, the components and their settings differ entirely.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the perfume bottle, including the cap and spray mechanism, accurately represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap and spray mechanism are represented using Lego pieces, mimicking the shapes seen in Image A but in a more simplistic, blocky manner. While the Lego design captures the essence of the shape, the intricacy and smoothness of the original design in Image A are not replicated due to the limitations of Lego bricks, making the representation approximate but not fully detailed.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stop-motion diorama style consistently applied to both the perfume bottle and the fabric background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the perfume bottle and the surrounding environment use Lego blocks, creating a unified, stylized aesthetic reminiscent of a built diorama. This consistency is maintained throughout the image, contrasting with Image A's use of realistic materials like glass and fabric. Thus, the stop-motion Lego style is applied uniformly across all elements in the edited image.",
