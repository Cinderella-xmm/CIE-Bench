      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress has a uniform golden-brown color throughout its structure. The edges appear slightly darker, giving the impression of baked cookie dough. This color scheme and texture are consistent with what is typically seen in baked goods such as cookies. The overall appearance closely mimics a gingerbread castle, which is enhanced by the use of similar colors and textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls and towers in Image B feature a golden-brown color that is characteristic of cookie dough. The edges of these structures appear darker, mimicking the baking effect seen when cookies are baked in an oven. This visual detail supports the impression that the fortress is made from baked cookie dough, emulating a gingerbread-like aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterfalls in Image B are presented as smooth, glossy streams flowing from the fortress structure. The texture and glossiness are indicative of royal icing, a decorating medium used in baking, rather than the appearance of natural water. This suggests that the image aims to portray a dessert-like environment, where elements are crafted from edible decorations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees in the image made from smooth, uniformly green-colored marzipan with no realistic leaf detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are depicted as uniformly green and smooth without any individual leaf details. This simplicity in design and texture is typical of marzipan or a similar confectionery material used in decorative baking, which lacks the complexity of natural foliage.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cookie castle placed on a large, flat, white ceramic platter that is clearly visible beneath and around the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie castle is resting on a large, flat, white ceramic platter. The platter is visible beneath the castle, extending around the base, which is a typical presentation style for decorative, edible items like cakes or gingerbread houses. This setting further emphasizes the edible, dessert-like nature of the fortress structure.",
