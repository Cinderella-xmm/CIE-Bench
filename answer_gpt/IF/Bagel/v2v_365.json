      "question": "Does the character retain the original shell structure and turtle attributes, reimagined in a cute, chibi-style design with long legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with a shell similar to that of a tortoise, maintaining the fundamental turtle attributes. However, it's reimagined in a chibi-style with a pronounced head and body shape, distinct from the realistic proportions seen in Image A. This character's legs are elongated, fitting the chibi design. Thus, the character retains its original elements but is stylized in a chibi form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted wearing stylish clothing, indicative of a modern design with a jacket and shorts. A pair of small glasses rests on its head. The character is seen carrying a sketchbook in its hand rather than having it secured behind the shell. Thus, all elements except the position of the sketchbook match.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character with a chic red and black checked scarf around its neck. Additionally, one of the character's appendages is a small designer bag. These accessories add a fashionable touch to the character's look.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aspect ratio does not appear to be 9:16. Instead, it seems more square-like. The image features the 'OOTD' text at the top, a full-body character taking up the majority of the central space, with clothing and accessory items displayed to its right. However, the layout and ratio do not match the described format.",
