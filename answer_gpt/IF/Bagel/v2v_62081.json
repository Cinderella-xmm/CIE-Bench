      "question": "Has the portrait been reimagined in a dynamic Xieyi style Chinese ink wash painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a portrait that exhibits visual characteristics typical of a Xieyi style Chinese ink wash painting. This style is known for capturing the essence and spirit of the subject with simple, dynamic strokes and washes. The use of flowing lines and soft transitions of ink and color suggests that the portrait was indeed reimagined in this particular style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the texture of the dark hair and the form of the blue coat conveyed using bold, spontaneous black ink strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair and the coat display a boldness and fluidity in their depiction, typical of spontaneous ink strokes. The strong lines and evident variations in thickness imply spontaneous application, which is characteristic of the expressive nature of Xieyi painting. This suggests that the textures and forms are conveyed with bold, spontaneous strokes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features and cravat articulated using softer, graded grey washes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a notable delineation in the hair and clothing, but the less detailed area of the face and cravat seems depicted with more subtlety, which may indicate softer, graded grey washes. However, without definite visible gradation in these mostly lost fine features, the decision is reliant on inference from typical ink wash styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the portrait captured on a subtly textured, antique white paper ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a background that appears to be an antique white with a subtle texture, resembling traditional textured papers often used in ink wash paintings. Such papers provide a tactile ground for ink paintings and are characteristic of traditional Chinese portrait presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the patterned wooden frame been simplified into a series of suggestive, darker ink outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distinct wooden frame present in Image A is entirely absent. Instead of featuring any outline or ink strokes suggestive of a frame, the portrait is isolated within its background. This suggests that any framing has been omitted rather than simplified into ink outlines.",
