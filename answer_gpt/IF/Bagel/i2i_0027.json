      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a chibi-style figurine characterized by an exaggerated large head, small body, and cartoonish features which is common in chibi figures. The simplified facial features and the design resemble the style often used in blind box figures. These visual cues indicate a conversion from a real dog in Image A to a chibi figurine in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dogâ€™s body still in the prone, ball-focused pose after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is standing upright on a base and holding a ball, contrasting with the prone, attentive pose seen in the real dog in Image A, which is focused on a tennis ball in front of it. The change from a realistic pose to a static, standing position on a base is evident.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the dog's head been enlarged slightly compared to its original size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style in Image B displays a disproportionately large head compared to the body, consistent with the design elements of chibi figures, which often feature larger heads for a cute appearance. In Image A, the dog's head size is proportionate to its body, making the head appear enlarged in the chibi figurine from Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball placed so that it touches the dog's nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure is holding the tennis ball, which is not touching the nose. In the original Image A, a tennis ball is placed very near to the dog's nose. The edited image shows no such contact, which means there is a change in the placement of the ball.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base feature a relief tennis ball pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B, which the chibi figure stands on, has lines that resemble the seams of a tennis ball, forming a pattern that looks like a stylized interpretation of a tennis ball. This suggests that the base indeed features a relief pattern inspired by a tennis ball.",
