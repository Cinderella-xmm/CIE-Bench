        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paint splatter texture from Image A has been replaced with a depiction of New York City skyline featuring skyscrapers and iconic buildings.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white electric guitar remains consistent in style and design with what is typically recognized in modern electric guitars.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes bold colors and clear lines that align more with bold modern typography, as seen in the vibrant depiction of cityscapes and overlaying elements. The use of structured lines and the color palette does not lean towards gritty subway art nor sophisticated jazz age graphics, but rather a modern look through its updated visual elements compared to Image A.",
