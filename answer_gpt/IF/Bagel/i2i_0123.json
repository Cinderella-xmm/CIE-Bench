      "question": "Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left parking meter that originally had a timer gauge now features an illustration of a small, cartoonish robotic dog within that space. Recognizing that the robotic character replaces the area where the timer was, it is evident the original timer is no longer visible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robotic dog clearly shown holding a coin in its paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the robotic dog within the parking meter's timer space is depicted holding an object that resembles a coin. The way it is positioned and grasped in the front of the paws makes it evident the robotic dog is holding a coin.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the parking meter still display billing information such as numbers and labels in a legible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the addition of the robotic dog illustration, the parking meter retains its original display of numbers and labels in the billing section. These elements appear unchanged and legible as before.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall shape and structure of the parking meter remained consistent with the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B features an illustration of a robotic dog in place of the timer, the overall shape, structure, and main features of the parking meter, including the body, coin slot, and labels, remain unchanged and consistent with the original design in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the robotic dog designed with features such as metallic textures or mechanical parts, making it identifiable as a robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the dog within the parking meter's timer area is styled in a cartoonish manner but has distinct mechanical features such as a metallic sheen, jointed limbs, and what appears to be mechanical components. These characteristics make it identifiable as a robotic dog.",
