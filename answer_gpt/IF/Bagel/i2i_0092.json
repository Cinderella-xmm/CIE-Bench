      "question": "Is the phone and stand completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a clear wood surface with no electronic objects like a phone or stand visible, indicating they have been removed. Since the question is asking about their removal, and there is no evidence of these items being present in Image B, we conclude they have been completely removed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the scene been replaced with a seaside café tabletop setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a wooden table with a view of the sea and ocean in the background, and there is direct sunlight present on the table. These are typical features of a seaside café setting, which often include such outdoor elements. Thus, the scene has indeed been replaced with a seaside café tabletop setting.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible sunlight and sea wave reflections on the tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, sunlight is clearly visible, causing a bright reflection on the wooden table surface. Additionally, the sparkling effect from the water, indicative of sea waves, is visible in the background. This confirms the presence of sunlight and reflections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, we can see a wooden table, a drink with a slice of lemon (often found in cafés), and a wicker chair on the side, enhancing the imagery of a seaside café. These elements collectively create a typical seaside café atmosphere.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a realistic tabletop perspective and composition in the seaside café setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perspective in Image B appears natural, with linearity in the table slats and consistent lighting that aligns with an outdoor setting. The composition includes precise renderings of the table, glass, and surroundings, all consistent with real life photography at a café by the sea.",
