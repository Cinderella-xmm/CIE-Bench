      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate textures resembling decadent chocolate and shiny sauce in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the main object resembles a chocolate cake with a glossy chocolate sauce drizzled on top, placed next to a bright green lettuce leaf. These elements suggest a design concept with rich, decadent chocolate textures and a glossy appearance akin to sauce. However, since the image depicts a food item rather than a sneaker, it does not directly relate to a sneaker design incorporating such textures.",

      "question": "Are the sneaker's contours in the edited image inspired by the fluid, natural shapes of lettuce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does depict a piece of lettuce on the plate, which has naturally curved and organic shapes typical of lettuce leaves. However, since there is no sneaker present in the image, the concept of contouring inspired by lettuce in sneaker design does not apply directly to the content displayed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image prioritize a visually imaginative concept over practicality in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a dessert item creatively placed with a lettuce leaf, a combination visually intriguing in a culinary context. No sneaker design is visible, so assessing practicality versus visual imagination in sneaker design is not applicable based on the visual information.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elements of the original dish—a chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and a lettuce leaf—are indeed present. However, they are presented as food items rather than being elements of a sneaker design. Thus, they are not represented in a sneaker design context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image showcases a food item, specifically a chocolate cake with sauce and lettuce, rather than a sneaker. Since there is no sneaker to analyze, evaluating its design's innovation and uniqueness based on the dish is not applicable. Therefore, it cannot reflect a creative sneaker interpretation.",
