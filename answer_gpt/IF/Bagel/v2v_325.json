      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars appear in a stylized, cartoonish form with exaggerated features such as animated eyes and facial expressions that resemble chibi-style mascots.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box in Image B features a colorful design with a road-like theme, as indicated by the presence of small car mascots and a name that plays on the theme of roads.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B includes elements that suggest a playful, car-themed environmentâ€”possibly a showroom rather than a pit stop. The setting is vibrant, with visible car toys and design elements related to cars.
