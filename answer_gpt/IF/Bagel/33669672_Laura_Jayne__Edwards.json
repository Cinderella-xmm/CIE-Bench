    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered as a bronze sculpture with a metallic surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be made of a metallic material with a bronze finish. This can be inferred from the surface reflectiveness and the uniform warm tone characteristic of bronze sculptures, as well as the lack of texture variations typical in fabric or flesh.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs visibly elongated compared to natural human proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs appear more elongated than typical human proportions. This is deduced from their length and slenderness relative to the torso and their exaggerated extension, a common technique in stylized sculpture to emphasize grace or dynamic posture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the legs form smooth, curved shapes that suggest dynamic movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B are depicted with sweeping curves, contributing to a sense of motion. This is visually supported by their flowing lines and the way they are posed, which typically indicates movement in artistic representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all floral elements been replaced with geometric patterns consistent with Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral elements seen in Image A have been transformed into stylized geometric forms which are consistent with the angular and ornamental characteristics of the Art Deco design style, replacing floral details with geometric shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rendered in metallic tones while preserving the original color scheme (teal, red, pink)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B portrays a metallic bronze tone rather than the original color scheme found in Image A, losing the individual teal, red, and pink hues to a uniform metal appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background a solid, uniform turquoise color matching the overall aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background maintains a solid and uniform turquoise color which matches the overall aesthetic, providing a consistent backdrop that complements the bronze figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the adornments on the figure composed of symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typical of Art Deco style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The adornments on the figure in Image B feature geometric patterns that are symmetrical and angular, reflecting the repetitive motif typical of the Art Deco style, such as the stylized plant-like forms replacing floral details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
