      "question": "Does the lens mount area feature a large, intricate mechanical eye with glowing amber irises?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens mount area is visually depicted as a large, mechanical eye that is characterized by intricate detailing and glowing amber irises, which are not typical features of a standard camera lens mount area. Using world knowledge, eyes are often symbolic elements in surreal and artistic depictions, suggesting something watchful or sentient. The presence of such a distinct element supports the answer.",
