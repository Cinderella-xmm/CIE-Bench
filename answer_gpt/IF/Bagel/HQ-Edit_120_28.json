      "question": "Is the background of the image now a weathered pirate map with aged parchment texture and sepia-toned colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a background with an aged parchment texture. The colors are predominantly sepia-toned, giving the impression of an old, weathered pirate map. This visual style is reinforced by the classic map elements and motifs, such as illustrated borders and a compass rose, which are typically associated with pirate maps.",

      "question": "Is the treasure chest depicted as a central element in the image using detailed ink sketch style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest is positioned prominently as a central element. The style is consistent with ink sketch techniques, characterized by strong outlines and shading that create a distinct, illustrated look. This method of depiction contrasts with more realistic or photographic styles, aligning with hand-drawn map aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, ropes and other nautical motifs are clearly used to frame the image, creating a decorative border along the edges. This design choice enhances the map-like appearance, as such elements are often employed to embellish the edges of old nautical maps, reinforcing the thematic setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible ship masts or sails integrated into the corners. The focus is on the map design with decorative elements like the chest, coins, and sea motifs, rather than incorporating detailed aspects of a ship's structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does feature sections with typography that resemble a legend, such as symbols and words associated with map features. However, there is no specific evidence of a clearly defined legend with detailed symbols for coins, gems, and pottery using bold, ancient-style typography. The elements present seem more artistic and less categorically organized.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a compass rose in the bottom-right corner. This compass rose is illustrated in earthy hues that match the sepia-toned map theme, rather than metallic tones like the coins in Image A. The stylization aligns with map illustrations, but not specifically in metallic hues.",
      "weight": 1,

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the design of Image B, there are indeed intricate motifs, including a sea monster, visible. Such features are typical of old maps, where artists would integrate mythical sea monsters and other creatures into the illustration, often in the margins or as decorative elements to add visual interest.",
