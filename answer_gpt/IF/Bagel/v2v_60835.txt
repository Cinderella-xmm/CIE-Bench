    "Question": "Q1: Have the cheetahs' leg joints been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' leg joints are clearly depicted as mechanical constructs, featuring polished brass pistons and gears instead of their natural anatomy. This transformation is visually evident through the metallic sheen and structured appearance, typical of mechanical components, such as pistons and gears. The presence of these components suggests a steampunk aesthetic, where organisms are often portrayed as mechanical beings.",

    "Question": "Q2: Has the cheetahs' spotted fur been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs exhibit sections of their bodies covered in what appears to be tooled leather and copper plating, replacing the natural spotted fur. This is indicated by the texture and color differences, where the usual fur pattern is interspersed with leather-like textures and metallic plating. The presence of such materials suggests an artistic integration of natural and mechanical elements.",
