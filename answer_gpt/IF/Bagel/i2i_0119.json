      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, we see an item closely resembling a keychain with a metal clasp attached to the design of the character 'Psyduck,' a recognizable Pok√©mon. The character is depicted in yellow with distinctive features such as a large beak and eyes, holding its head. This suggests the keychain features this character design. World knowledge of commonly available keychains often being in the form of popular character designs supports this conclusion.",

      "question": "Is the keychain placed on a wooden office desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain rests on a surface that visually resembles a wooden texture, which is fairly common for office desks. The grain and color tint suggest a wood material. Such desks are often used in office or study environments, supporting the conclusion that the keychain is on a wooden desk.",

      "question": "Are there books visible next to the keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows part of an object that resembles a book, indicated by what appears to be a spine and the corner of pages next to the keychain. This layout aligns with common office or study settings where books could be present. This leads to the conclusion that a book is indeed visible next to the keychain.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is an object in Image B that looks like glasses to the right of the keychain. The circular shapes and thin frame are typical of eyewear. It is not uncommon to find glasses placed on desks in contexts where reading or work is conducted. Therefore, glasses are present in close proximity to the keychain.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the keychain is placed flat on the desk, with both a book and glasses located nearby. The spatial arrangement seems coherent and organized, as might be expected in a well-arranged workspace or reading area. Thus, the keychain is properly positioned on the desk alongside the books and glasses.",
