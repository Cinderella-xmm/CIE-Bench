      "question": "Is the tall ice tower in the foreground rendered with pixelated textures and visible circuit-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall ice tower is depicted using clear pixelated textures and is designed with patterns that resemble electronic circuits. This indicates a deliberate artistic choice to convey a digital theme. Pixelation and circuit-like designs are visual elements commonly associated with digital or cyber aesthetics, suggesting a futuristic or technical interpretation. Therefore, the appearance of the ice tower in Image B distinctly follows this aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House represented using glowing neon lines instead of solid surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Sydney Opera House depicted with glowing neon lines, forming the iconic shapes but without the solid surfaces seen in a realistic portrayal. The neon outlines stand out against the background and give the structure a digital, futuristic vibe often used in virtual or retro-futuristic representations. This contrasts with a traditional photo where the Opera House would have solid, tangible surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves in the ocean composed of geometric shapes rather than realistic water ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are illustrated using geometric shapes and lines, creating a pattern that conveys the digital or cyberpunk aesthetic. Instead of depicting realistic water movements with organic, flowing forms, the waves are presented in a structured, angular manner, reinforcing the theme of a digital transformation of natural elements.",

      "question": "Does the drink on the left appear as a transparent, floating hologram with visible depth and light distortion effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drink on the left does not give the impression of being a transparent, floating hologram. It retains a solid form with visible details like ice cubes, but it seems to exhibit more texture and coloring more in line with a digital or screen-like texture, rather than an actual holographic projection with depth and light distortion. The drink's presentation maintains a tangible appearance, not matching typical hologram characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a unified futuristic digital aesthetic, with all elements (ice tower, Opera House, ocean, drink) transformed according to their specified styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a consistent application of a futuristic digital aesthetic across all elements. The ice tower has pixelated textures and circuit-like patterns; the Sydney Opera House is outlined in glowing neon lines; the ocean waves are geometric and stylized. Even though the drink on the left doesn't appear holographic, its presentation aligns with the overall cyber theme. This unified transformation suggests a coherent artistic vision aimed at portraying a digital reinterpretation of the scene.",
