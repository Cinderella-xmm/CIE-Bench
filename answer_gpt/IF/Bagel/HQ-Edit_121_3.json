      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the butterfly been transformed into a creature that visually resembles a floral being, with no recognizable insectoid body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original insectoid nature of the butterfly is replaced by elements resembling plant parts. The body appears to be made of floral and leaf structures, which are typically not associated with insects. There are no recognizable features such as the typical segmented body or legs of an insect. Instead, the entire form is reimagined in a floral motif, making it appear more like a plant-based entity than an insect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings appear folded into distinct, vibrant petal-like structures instead of flat, membranous insect wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B resemble large, colorful petal-like forms rather than the usual flat and somewhat transparent insect wings. These petal-like structures add to the impression of a floral creature, differing significantly from the butterfly's typical wing shape and texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the butterfly's body now resemble a thin, upright flower stalk rather than an insectâ€™s segmented torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central part of the creature seems to transition from being an insect's segmented body to something that resembles a slender, upright flower stalk. This visual transformation aligns with the overall floral theme of the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original wing patterns replaced with detailed, naturalistic leaf designs across the entire surface of the wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wings replaced with surfaces resembling naturalistic leaves. These leaf designs have intricate patterns similar to real leaves, moving away from the original monarch butterfly wing patterns seen in the first image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible tendril-like structures extending from the tips of the butterfly's antennae?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the antennae end in curled structures that resemble tendrils, commonly seen in plants. This replaces the original straight and simple antennae of the butterfly, enhancing the floral appearance of the creature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small blossoms visibly attached to the edges of the wings and at the foot/lowest part of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited butterfly in Image B features small blossom-like formations attached to various parts of the body, including the edges of the wings. These floral embellishments contribute to the transformation into a plant-like entity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background identical to the original image, featuring the same meadow with pink coneflowers, golden grasses, and blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B remains consistent with that of Image A. Both depict a meadow landscape with pink coneflowers, golden grasses, and a blue sky, indicating that the changes are focused solely on the butterfly rather than its surroundings.",
