      "question": "Does the geisha's figure appear as a stained glass artwork with distinct lead-like outlines separating colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geisha is depicted with clear, bold outlines surrounding each colored section, characteristic of stained glass artwork. This style typically involves the use of lead or dark lines to separate different colored glass pieces, and Image B exemplifies this with its segmented patterns and vibrant coloring.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the kimono patterns composed of flowing, curvilinear organic designs such as vines or flowers, rendered in vivid jewel tones (e.g., deep reds, blues, greens)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono patterns in Image B are composed of geometric shapes with bold, contrasting colors rather than flowing, organic designs. The colors are vivid, but they do not form curvilinear organic patterns like vines or flowers; instead, they appear more abstract, mimicking stained glass forms.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted as glass-like elements with segmented petals, dark outlines, and translucent coloring typical of stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include cherry blossoms; instead, the background features abstract and geometric representations typical of stained glass art. There isn't a depiction involving cherry blossoms with dark outlines or translucent coloring as seen in stained glass work.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan held by the geisha is distinctly themed with peacock designs, including eye-patterned feathers. These feathers have iridescent, multi-colored surfaces, replacing the simpler traditional style seen in stained glass-like art.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background composed of curving, interwoven lines and shaded areas forming an abstract mosaic pattern consistent with Art Nouveau design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B displays curving lines and interwoven patterns reminiscent of mosaic art, which aligns with Art Nouveau's emphasis on organic and flowing forms. The stained glass elements further support this design style through abstract shading and coloration.",
