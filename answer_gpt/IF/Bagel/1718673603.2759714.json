      "question": "Are all structural elements of the Japanese house rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black lead lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Japanese house is depicted in a style reminiscent of stained glass, where each structural element is visually divided into sections bound by black lines, imitating traditional lead lines in stained glass art. These segments are filled with various colors, capturing the distinct characteristics of window panes in stained glass. The characteristic grid pattern and use of vibrant colors support the interpretation that this was done intentionally to represent stained glass.",

      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized floral motifs made of red and green segmented glass pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the areas that correspond to trees in the original Image A are now represented by stylized red and green shapes that closely resemble floral motifs. These are constructed from segmented glass pieces, which is typical of stained glass artwork where organic forms like florals are common. This deliberate choice and design create a floral appearance rather than the original tree structure.",

      "question": "Is the large red moon rendered using multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the moon is simplified into a circular form with a gradient that transitions from deep red to orange and yellow, suggesting a sunset rather than a solid full moon. However, there are no overlapping or concentric circles that would reflect the appearance of a gradient in traditional stained glass. Instead, it maintains a single, solid circular representation typical in stained glass design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all major elements (house, trees, moon) clearly outlined with thick, black, continuous lines resembling lead came in stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all prominent elements including the house, floral motifs (originally trees), and the sun (originally moon) are delineated with thick, continuous black lines that are characteristic of lead came used in stained glass. This technique is employed throughout the image, ensuring a coherent stained glass appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene maintain the original composition (house centered, trees flanking, moon above, water in foreground) while all elements are styled as stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition remains consistent with Image A, where the house is centrally located, flanked by floral motifs (formerly trees), with the sun (formerly a moon) positioned above. The inclusion of aquatic elements is suggested by the use of blue tones near the base, similar to water in the foreground. This spatial arrangement is preserved, but the transformation into a stained glass style unifies the visual theme.",
