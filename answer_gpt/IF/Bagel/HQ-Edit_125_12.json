      "question": "Has the wooden surface been replaced with an elegant marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface on which the teapot sits has a smooth and polished appearance with distinct veining patterns typical of marble. This is consistent with how marble surfaces are generally depicted. Thus, the surface in Image B has been replaced with an elegant marble texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a transparent label overlaid on the teapot with visible text including \"Earl Grey Elegance\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the body of the teapot, there is a distinct section where text is clearly visible. The text 'Earl Grey Elegance' is prominently displayed within a label-like area that looks integrated onto the teapot. This suggests that a label with text has been added to the teapot in Image B.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a finely embossed gold monogram logo visible on the lid of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's lid does not feature a distinct gold monogram logo. Instead, the lid appears to have intricate engravings that are part of the design but not specifically a monogram logo. Given that the logo is not visibly distinct, it indicates the absence of a gold monogram on the lid.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a box present in the image with engravings similar in style to those on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no box visible in the image. The image prominently features a teapot, which is situated on a marble surface, and no additional objects like a box are present in the composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition reflect a luxury tea brand packaging design with cohesive branding elements such as elegant textures, consistent engravings, and premium presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several elements that suggest a luxury tea brand's packaging design: the marble texture on the surface exudes elegance, the distinct label with 'Earl Grey Elegance' on the teapot adds a branding aspect, and the teapot's uniform design with detailed engravings gives a premium feel. Collectively, these elements align with characteristics typical of a high-end brand presentation.",
