    "Question": "Q1: Has the giraffe been turned into an adorable collection of Russian nesting dolls with a chibi giraffe theme?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue clearly shows a series of Russian nesting dolls, each painted with a giraffe-like pattern and characteristics. The largest doll has the appearance of a giraffe with a long neck and adorned with giraffe spots, which transforms the image of a giraffe into a chibi style art form commonly associated with nesting dolls. This indicates a transition from an actual giraffe to a stylized, cute representation of one in the form of nesting dolls.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are there exactly five nesting dolls arranged in descending sizes?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays five distinct nesting dolls placed side by side. The dolls are clearly arranged in descending order of size, starting with the largest giraffe-themed doll on the left and becoming progressively smaller towards the right. This arrangement reflects the typical nesting doll structure where each one fits inside the next size up.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the nesting dolls arranged neatly on a classy wooden table?",
    "explanation": "The image reveals that the nesting dolls are positioned on a flat, wooden surface, suggesting a table or a shelf. The grain and sheen of the wood, along with its smooth finish, give it a classy appearance, reinforcing the idea that the surface is indeed a table meant for display.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image have a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
    "explanation": "The horizontal aspect ratio refers to the proportion of width to height in an image. Visually, Image B is wider than it is tall, and through estimation, it appears to fit the common 3:2 aspect ratio often used in photography. This typical photographic proportion supports the conclusion that the edited image likely follows that ratio.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the nesting dolls maintain a chibi style with large heads, small bodies, and simplified features?",
    "explanation": "Chibi style is characterized by exaggerated features, particularly large heads and small bodies, emphasizing a cute and endearing aesthetic. The nesting dolls in Image B clearly exhibit these qualities, with disproportionately large heads compared to their bodies and facial features that are simplified and cartoonish, fitting the chibi art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
