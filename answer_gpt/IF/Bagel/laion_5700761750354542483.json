      "question": "Is the butterfly now made of soft fabric instead of metallic or gemstone materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly exhibits characteristics typical of soft fabric, as opposed to hard metallic or gemstone materials which are usually reflective and rigid. The visual texture and folding suggest fabric usage, as the color is evenly distributed and lacks the shininess that metals or gemstones have. Common sense tells us that the presence of embroidered patterns also indicates that the material is likely fabric. Therefore, based on the analysis of texture, color distribution, and surface characteristics, the butterfly is indeed made of soft fabric.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements on the butterflyâ€™s wings replaced with embroidered patterns in vibrant blue and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the butterfly show various designs made with thread, creating patterns. These designs feature vibrant blue and gold colors, common in embroidery practices. This contrasts with gemstone settings where light typically reflects off the facets. Reasoning from the appearance, the butterfly's decorations in Image B are indeed embroidered patterns.",

      "question": "Do the wings of the butterfly appear to be made of a velvety material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the butterfly's wings in Image B shows a smooth, luxurious appearance that is characteristic of velvety material. Velvet often has a soft sheen and a delicate pile, which is visually represented in the butterfly wing's fabric-like surface. The enhanced softness and richness seen in the texture indicate it is velvety.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there fluffy or fuzzy textures visible along the edges of the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the butterfly's wings in Image B feature a distinct, soft and fluffy texture. This texture is characterized by protruding fiber strands that are visually similar to fur or fuzz, often created by materials such as faux fur. The visual cues clearly demonstrate a fluffy edge not present in hard materials like those used in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original shape and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B maintains the fundamental shape of the wings and body similar to Image A. Familiarity with butterfly shapes supports the observation that wing curvature, body size, and general proportions remain consistent. Although the material change affects the texture, the overall shape is retained.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned atop a plain pearl-white cushion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the butterfly resting against a background typical of a cushion, evident by its rounded and soft form consistent with fabric cushions. The color is pearl-white, which is deduced through the uniform opacity and shade similarity to a typical white pillow or cushion.",
