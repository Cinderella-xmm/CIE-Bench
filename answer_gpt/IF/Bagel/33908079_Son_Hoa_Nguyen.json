      "question": "Has the worker been cartoonized with slightly exaggerated or simplified features compared to the original photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker is depicted as a cartoon with exaggerated and simplified facial features. Characteristics typical of cartoon imagery, such as clear outlines and flat colors, are used to simplify the complexity of human features seen in Image A. The overall form is recognizable but stylized in a more playful and abstract way compared to the realistic depiction in the original photo.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the worker’s hands visibly enlarged in proportion to the rest of the body to emphasize the tea-picking action?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the worker’s hands are drawn noticeably larger than the rest of the body. This artistic choice is common in cartoons to emphasize specific actions or traits; in this case, it underscores the tea-picking activity. Normally, hands wouldn't be as prominent in realistic proportions, as shown in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the tea plantation fields display vibrant green and earthy tones as the dominant color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea plantation is represented with vibrant green tones, which dominate the color palette, akin to Image A. This use of color helps convey the lushness of the tea fields in both the realistic and cartoon contexts, though Image B tends towards more uniform and bright colors characteristic of stylized art.",

      "question": "Does the logo on the sack feature a gold foil effect, making it appear shiny and metallic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the sack does not exhibit a gold foil effect. Instead, it is rendered in a flat, illustrative style typical of cartoons. Unlike a metallic effect which would involve gradients and reflections, the logo here uses solid colors without any shine.",

      "question": "Are there decorative vine-patterned borders surrounding the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains decorative vine-patterned borders which frame the picture, creating an ornamental effect. This border is an added element not present in Image A, enhancing the designed and artistic appearance of the cartoon image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image displayed within a textured, recycled paper-style album background or frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon is set against a background that has the appearance of textured paper, mimicking a recycled or natural paper look. This is further emphasized with the stylized frame, which is different from the natural setting of Image A, providing a more crafted aesthetic.",
