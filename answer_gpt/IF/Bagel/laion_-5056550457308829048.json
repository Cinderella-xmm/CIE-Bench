      "question": "Is the image formatted as a cereal box design with visible box-like structure or paneling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visual cues indicating a rectangular shape with a red border and a glossy surface that suggests it's a product box similar to cereal packaging. Additionally, the text 'Basketball Breskanst Blitz!' closely resembles branding suitable for product presentation similar to cereals. By applying world knowledge of common cereal box designs, which often display characters, logos, and branding on a box-like structure, it's reasonable to conclude that Image B is designed to resemble a cereal box.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an urban sports scene featuring graffiti-style elements such as spray paint art, street markings, or urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to contain artistic and colorful design elements that mimic graffiti, similar to spray paint art one might find on urban streets. These elements provide a distinctive urban sports theme, deviating from the clearer and outdoor scenery typified by Image A. Using world knowledge about urban art and graffiti, it is reasoned that Image B integrates these elements to convey an urban sports ambiance.",

      "question": "Is the text “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” displayed in bold font across the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is text situated prominently across the top section that reads ‘Basketball Breskanst Blitz!’, but the text is not ‘Basketball Breakfast Blitz!’. It is written in a bold font for emphasis and visibility, aligning with the typical placement and styling used on product boxes such as breakfast cereals to catch consumer attention. The discrepancy in phrasing makes the answer to this query specific to the exact wording.",

      "question": "Does Patrick’s shirt now feature printed basketball-themed motifs (e.g., basketballs, hoops, or court designs)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Patrick's attire prominently showcases a printed design that features the character SpongeBob rather than basketball-themed motifs. The design remains character-driven without visible basketballs or other sports imagery, which are the elements typical of a basketball theme. By comparing with the more straightforward sports shirt in Image A, it's evident there's a lack of basketball motifs.",

      "question": "Are SpongeBob’s shoes replaced with sneakers that visibly feature cereal loop patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows SpongeBob wearing shoes characterized by vivid designs with colorful loops or circular patterns, suggesting a playful or cereal-related motif. These designs differ from the plain shoes in Image A, where no such patterns are evident. Utilizing knowledge of cereal loops often used as motifs in food-related marketing, Image B effectively integrates them into the character's footwear, indicating a thematic transformation.",

      "question": "Are there illustrated cereal hoops (ring-shaped cereal pieces) depicted flying around SpongeBob and Patrick?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of Image B reveals no presence of flying ring-shaped cereal pieces or hoops around SpongeBob and Patrick, as might be expected in a cereal-themed layout. The visible objects resemble basketballs, matching the sports theme rather than cereal. Comparing both images, there are no hoop changes or additions, indicating that cereal motifs have not been utilized in this manner.",
