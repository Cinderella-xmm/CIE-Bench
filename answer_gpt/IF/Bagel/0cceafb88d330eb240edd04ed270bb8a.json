      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As we avoid discussing the blurred face, however, based on the chibi style and in conjunction with the body's exaggerated proportions and simple design, it's logical to infer that the facial features likely follow the same minimalistic style with possible small, simplistic eyes and soft contours typical of chibi interpretations.",
