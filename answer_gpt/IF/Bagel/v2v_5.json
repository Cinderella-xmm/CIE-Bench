      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is shown as a small, cartoonish character with exaggerated features typical of chibi style such as a large head and small body. This stylized representation often aims to be cute, which aligns with the 3D rendering in the edited image. The analysis is guided by recognizing these features which are characteristic of chibi forms.",

      "question": "Are the zebra’s stripes and distinctive pattern accurately depicted as in the original photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the zebra has realistic patterns and stripes which are nature-accurate. In Image B, while the stripes are present, they follow a more simplified, stylized version consistent with the chibi depiction. Instead of aiming for realistic accuracy, the focus in Image B is on maintaining a playful and cartoonish feel. Thus, while there is recognition of the zebra pattern, it is not accurate as in the original photo.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows the zebra interacting with a small cake that mirrors the design of the cake in Image A, but in a more playful manner due to the chibi style. The zebra is shown close to the cake, which suggests engagement. Comparing both images, the cake serves as a common theme, but in Image B the interaction has a playful artistic twist due to the overall chibi theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is shown within a social media-themed frame, suggesting a design reminiscent of an Instagram frame. The zebra's posture and facial expression indicate curiosity, and it appears to be leaning in towards the cake. The presence of the frame and the position of the zebra support the idea that it is sitting or positioned at the edge of this frame.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the frame around the zebra has text at the top which reads 'ZebraLover'. This username placement is akin to a social media profile header, which is common in Instagram and similar platforms. This design cue is straightforward in depicting the intended choice of username.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several distinct icons are visible surrounding the zebra and the frame, each representative of common social media functionalities such as like, comment, and share. These icons are designed to signify interaction elements typical in social media, floating around to emphasize the theme. This context is consistent with the question.",
