    "Question": "Q1: Is the warrior statue composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with visible brick-like elements forming its body, limbs, and head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a LEGO minifigure with characteristic blocky features such as the arms, legs, and torso, and has clear joints and lines typically associated with LEGO construction. The visual details, such as the arms and torso, are simplified with smooth finishes, consistent with LEGO design, indicating that the figure is made of LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the primary colors used in the statue limited to shades of brown and tan?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO minifigure in brown and tan shades, which align with the typical color palette used in creating wood-like appearances or certain characters in LEGO sets. The consistent brown shades on the figure suggest a limited color scheme focused on brown and tan.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the armor sections (such as chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards) made of smooth LEGO bricks without surface texture?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the armor sections of the LEGO minifigure do not show detailed surface textures typical of carved or engraved materials. Instead, they depict simplistic line patterns, a common approach in LEGO figures, which are generally smooth due to the nature of the bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental details such as the headdress, necklace, and carvings on the torso created using textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, any visible patterns on the torso or body are printed or painted onto smooth surfaces typical of LEGO minifigures rather than being made of textured bricks. These details, such as the headdress and torso designs, appear flat rather than embossed, characteristic of LEGO's design approach.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue positioned on a plain white pedestal with no decorative elements, located in a gallery environment with framed artworks on the walls and track lighting overhead?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO minifigure on a plain pedestal in what appears to be a gallery setting, indicated by the visible walls and artworks hung on them and the track lighting overhead. These elements suggest the minifigure is displayed in an exhibition-like environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the LEGO statue retain the same standing posture, facial expression, and proportional dimensions as the original wooden warrior?",
    "explanation": "Without comparing to Image A directly, Image B shows a standard LEGO minifigure posture, which is quite static and blocky. LEGO figures typically have limited articulation and fixed expressions, distinct from life-sized statues with more realistic dimensions and expressions. The proportions are inherently different due to the nature of LEGO figures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the statue visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, with no continuous surfaces resembling carved wood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of the minifigure is indicative of interlocking LEGO bricks due to the visible seams, distinct modules, and block-like construction typical of LEGO toys. There are no continuous woody textures present, aligning with the characteristic LEGO aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
