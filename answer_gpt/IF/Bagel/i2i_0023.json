      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the photo been converted into a minimalist flat illustration-style sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements like the boy and birds are simplified into a cartoonish, flat-style drawing, which is typical for a minimalist illustration. This style involves reducing details and using bold colors and outlines to convey the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the boy and all bird outlines clearly present in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the boy and all birds are clear and bold, which is characteristic of a sticker design. Each element is distinct and easily differentiated by its contour",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have block colors been used for the boy's skin tones and the birds' feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses solid, flat colors with no gradients or textures for skin tones and feather colors, which is a hallmark of block color usage in illustrations. This style simplifies the image for clarity and visual appeal in stickers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no background detail present, only the main subjects are visible against a plain base, showing that the background has been removed. This helps focus attention on the main subjects, a common practice in sticker design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the boyâ€™s head been slightly enlarged and the birds shrunk to achieve a neatly arranged composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions appear altered compared to typical human and bird sizes to fit neatly into the composition, with the boy's head seemingly more prominent. This is a stylistic choice in illustrations to emphasize certain subjects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has a thick white outline been added around the boy and birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a distinct, thick white border surrounding the illustration of the boy and birds, which is common in sticker designs to make the image stand out against various backgrounds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image have a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B has no visible detailed background, the presence of a plain backdrop or bounding line typical in stickers suggests that the background is likely designed to be transparent or easily separated for sticker use.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
