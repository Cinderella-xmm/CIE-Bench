    "Question": "Q1: Is there a top view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows four different views of the baseball and glove. The second quadrant of the edited image clearly displays a top-down view of a baseball inside a glove, indicating a top view is present. This is derived from the orientation of the glove and baseball, where the open part of the glove faces upwards with the baseball resting inside.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a side view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image includes multiple views of the baseball and glove arrangement. A side view would typically show the glove and baseball from a lateral perspective, revealing the thickness and depth. The edited image lacks such a view entirely showing the side perspective of both the glove and baseball.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a sectional view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors and textures of the baseball and glove accurately preserved in all views?",
