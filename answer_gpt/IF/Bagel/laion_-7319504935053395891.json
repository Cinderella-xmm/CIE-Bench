      "question": "Is the chocolate tower redesigned into a box-shaped structure resembling a festive tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape is distinctly a triangular form, resembling a typical Christmas tree shape, unlike the circular and layered form of a chocolate tower. This box-shaped design is common for festive-themed packaging. Thus, the structure in Image B resembles a festive tree box.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible cutout sections in the triangular tree shape, which allows you to see the chocolate that is nestled within these cutouts. This aligns with the idea of a festive tree box where internal contents might be showcased.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
