        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text on the top of the refrigerator is visible and reads 'Xu's Fresh Zone', indicating a change in the brand logo area. By observing that replaced text on what is typically the location for a brand logo on a refrigerator, we conclude this change was made.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
