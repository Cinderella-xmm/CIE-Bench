      "question": "Does the edited image combine the front and right-side views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cat is illustrated in a three-quarters view, which is a common artistic representation combining both frontal and slight side views. The face is turned slightly to the side, which suggests a blend of front and right-side views, albeit simplified. The depicted stance allows viewers to see parts of the face, including the nose and both eyes dynamically. Based on visual arts context, this is a technique often used to give a flat image more dimension and depth, simulating multiple viewpoints.",

      "question": "Are the cat's facial features clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays a cat with distinct facial features, including almond-shaped eyes, a small nose, and whiskers. These elements are illustrated with sharp lines and clear definition. The clarity of these features is typical of line art illustrations, where simplicity and high contrast are used to highlight details in the absence of color gradients or textures.",

      "question": "Is the cat's body structure properly showcased in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the body structure of the cat is simplified but remains recognizable. The posture is standard for a sitting or slightly crouched position, with all four limbs visible and proportionate to the animal's body. However, fine anatomical details are not as prominent as in a realistic photograph; the focus is on the primary outline to ensure the viewer easily recognizes the subject as a cat.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original color, size, and position of the cat been preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not preserve the original photo's detailed color and texture, as it is a line drawing primarily in black and white with a few accent colors. The size and position are interpreted rather than direct replicas, as it depicts an artistic expression. The original's realism is replaced by illustrative style, altering colors, size, and detailed photorealistic positioning.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition free from distortion and inconsistency in integrating both views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the edited image's illustrative nature, the drawn representation creates a proportional and coherent composition of the cat. The visual style maintains consistency without evident distortions; the integration of views allows the cat to appear naturally positioned in its stylized form. The use of coherent line art ensures there's uniformity throughout the composition.",
