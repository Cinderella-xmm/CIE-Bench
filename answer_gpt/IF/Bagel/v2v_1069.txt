    "Question": "Q3: Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, there is no visible evidence of intricate shimmering patterns cast on nearby surfaces, which could be attributed to light refracting through the globe. Such effects, typically seen when light interacts with rounded glass objects, are not apparent in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
