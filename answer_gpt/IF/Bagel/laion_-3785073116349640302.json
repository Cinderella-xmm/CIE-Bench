      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are inside a transparent spherical enclosure commonly known as a snow globe. The visual cues include the curved appearance of the enclosing surface and the optical distortions typical of glass globes. The globe's transparency allows for viewing the figures within from all angles, indicating that the scene is entirely enclosed within this structure.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures resemble the chibi art style, which is known for its exaggerated features, such as larger heads and simplified, cute bodies.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B appear to reflect light, giving them a somewhat shiny and glossy appearance. This indicates a smooth and possibly glossy material, as evidenced by the way light interacts with the surfaces of the figures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small, sparkling particles visible within the transparent globe, resembling snow or glitter. These particles are shown swirling around the figures, a common characteristic of snow globes where bits are suspended in liquid to create a sparkling effect when shaken.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the globe in Image B is stylized but does not display rugged terrain or metallic debris. Instead, it features a rocky and cartoonish appearance without intricate detailing that would suggest a more realistic or complex landscape.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer surface of the globe in Image B does not appear to have any etched cosmic patterns. The visible designs are mainly from the particles within and the visual distortion through the glass rather than any external decorations.",
