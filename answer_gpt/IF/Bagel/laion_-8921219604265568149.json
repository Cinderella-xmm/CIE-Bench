      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a small representation of a cathedral surrounded by tiny human figurines, indicating it is designed as a miniature model. The visual cues, such as the scale of the cathedral compared to the size of the figurines, suggest it is not life-sized but rather a model. Common sense tells us that this disproportionate scale reflects the characteristics of miniature scene design.",
