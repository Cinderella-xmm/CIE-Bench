        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate that the couple's backs have been altered to resemble a crystal-like silhouette, characterized by a dotted, illuminated pattern that suggests a more decorative and artistic interpretation.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts altered silhouettes characterized by a dotted, illuminated pattern, hinting at transparency and reflective qualities commonly associated with crystal materials. This gives a sense of a translucent and light-reflecting surface, which is typical in designs mimicking crystal.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation affects more than just the silhouettes of the couple.
