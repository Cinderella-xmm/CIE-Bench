      "question": "Are the vegetables in the dish visibly smaller than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables appear significantly smaller compared to their counterparts in Image A. This conclusion is based on the comparative size of each broccoli floret, which seems reduced in Image B. By understanding that Image B is an edited version, this shrinkage can be identified as a deliberate change, contrasting with the more robust appearance of the florets in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the space between the vegetables increased due to their shrinkage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is more visible space between the individual broccoli pieces, which indicates that the space has increased. This is likely a consequence of the reduction in vegetable size, leading to a less densely packed arrangement. By comparing Image B to Image A, where the broccoli florets are more closely packed, this distinction becomes apparent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vegetables maintain their original shapes and colors despite being smaller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli maintains its original shape and color, resembling the typical green hue and floret structure. Despite the size reduction, these characteristics persist. A comparison to Image A shows that while the size differs, the shape and color remain unchanged, demonstrating consistency in appearance beyond the size change.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the size of the dish holding the vegetables unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the size of the dish seems to remain the same as in Image A. This conclusion is drawn by observing that the dimensions and proportions of the dish compared to the broccoli and the visible space does not suggest any difference from Image A, where the dish originally appeared.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Have any new elements been added or existing elements removed besides shrinking the vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no new elements are apparent, nor have any existing features besides the size of the broccoli florets been modified or removed. Both the dishes and the broccoli itself exist as they were in Image A, with the only distinguishable transformation being the reduction in the size of the florets.",
