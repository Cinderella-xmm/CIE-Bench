    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire cat composed of crystal materials with no visible fur?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat appears to be made entirely of crystal materials, characterized by its faceted edges and transparent appearance. There is no indication of fur; the entire figure demonstrates the reflective and translucent properties typical of crystals. By combining world knowledge about crystal art and evaluating Image B's attributes, it's reasonable to conclude that the cat figure is composed solely of crystal materials.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the body parts of the cat constructed primarily from clear and smoky quartz crystals?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cat constructed with clear crystalline materials combined with darker accents. These visual cues align with the appearance of clear and smoky quartz, which are often used in crystal figurines for their transparent and varied coloring properties. Thus, based on the appearance and common use of these types of crystals, it appears that the cat's body is made from clear and smoky quartz crystals.",

The pattern mimics the distribution of colors in a calico cat effectively. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of obsidian properties, it is likely that obsidian accents are used for this purpose.",
