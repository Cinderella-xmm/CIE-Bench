      "question": "Has the vase and bouquet been transformed into a 3D printed display model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase and bouquet appear as a monochromatic, uniformly colored structure with smooth surfaces and precise detailing typical of a 3D printed model. The arrangement of the flowers and vase style seems to be retained from a potentially original design, now rendered in a manner characteristic of 3D printing technology, indicating such a transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D printed model appear to be made of matte material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase and bouquet in Image B do not exhibit any glossy or reflective qualities in their surface finish. They appear smooth and even in texture, commonly associated with a matte finish. This deduction is made based on the uniformity of color and shading which lacks any sheen.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a display plaque added at the base of the 3D printed model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small plaque or card placed at the base of the model. This feature is indicative of a display setup, typically used in exhibitions or product presentations to provide information about the model or artwork.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a setting with blurred figures in formal attire and exhibit-style panels in the background, which is commonly seen in tech expos or trade shows. This ambiance indicates an environment that aligns with such events where new models or technologies, like 3D printed objects, might be showcased.",

      "question": "Does the 3D printed model maintain the design of the original vase and bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without direct reference to an unaltered version of the vase and bouquet in Image A, the model in Image B seems to carry a thematic design representative of a vase and bouquet. The preservation of key features like the vase shape and flower arrangement suggests that the original design concept has been maintained, albeit transformed into a 3D printed form.",
