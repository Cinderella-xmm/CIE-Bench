    "Question": "Q1: Does the oatmeal blend visibly include robust whole grains, nuts, tropical fruits, and natural sweeteners?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see a bowl of oatmeal next to the cereal box, accompanied by a few pieces of fruit such as strawberries and what appears to be an orange slice and possibly an apple or lime. The visible oatmeal flakes are consistent with whole grains, but there are no visible signs of nuts or explicit indicators of tropical fruits like pineapple or mangoes, or natural sweeteners like honey or syrup. Thus, while there are some whole grains and fruits, nuts and explicit natural sweeteners are not visibly part of the blend.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the elephant mascot depicted as a whimsical, stylized 3D chibi-style character with a C4D-level render?",
    "explanation": "The depiction of the elephant on the cereal box in Image B is more stylized and cartoon-like, rather than realistic. However, it does not show characteristics typical of chibi-style, which often exaggerate features for cuteness, such as very large eyes or disproportionately small bodies. The rendering quality is clean, but it lacks the detailed and polished finish that a C4D-level (Cinema 4D) render would typically have.",
