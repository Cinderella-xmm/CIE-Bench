    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dagger now rendered as a soft, plush toy rather than a rigid weapon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a dagger but appears to be crafted from soft, plush materials, suggesting it is a toy rather than a functional weapon. This is inferred from the fabric-like appearance and its voluminous, stuffed nature, typical of plush toys. No metallic or rigid parts are visible, reinforcing this interpretation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blade made of soft, silver-gray fabric with black embroidered patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade appears to be crafted from a silver-gray fabric adorned with black embroidered patterns. This is discerned from the texture, which reflects a textile rather than metal, and the design, which mimics embroidery rather than etching. Such details imply the item is a plush toy with soft materials.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hilt made of a soft, faux ivory-like fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hilt is rendered in light colors similar to ivory but exhibits a plush, fabric-like texture. This suggests it's made from a soft material designed to mimic the appearance of ivory, often seen in plush or fabric-based representations of objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all edges of the plush dagger, including the hilt and blade, appear rounded and smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the entire object, comprising the hilt and blade, appear rounded and smooth without any sharp points, consistent with the design of plush toys. This smoothness differentiates it from a real dagger, which has defined, sharp edges.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the plush dagger appear stuffed and voluminous, with softened contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dagger in Image B looks stuffed, exhibiting an expanded, voluminous form consistent with plush items. Its contours are visibly smoothed and lack the precise, defined edges typical of real weapons, indicating it is a soft toy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the plush dagger placed against a solid-colored backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop is a consistent, solid light blue color. This is typical for product photography where the focus is on the object, and the background is made simple to not distract from the item being showcased.",
