    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Blue Jay rendered as a miniature sculpture made of a solid material such as ceramic or metal, rather than a live bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Blue Jay in Image B appears stylized, with clear material properties that suggest it is solid and not a live bird. The texture of the object, along with its smooth, shiny, and reflective surface, indicates it is made from a solid material like ceramic or a painted metal. The rigid appearance and lack of organic detail typically seen in a live bird further support this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the Blue Jay sculpture enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Blue Jay sculpture is encased in a clear, transparent structure that surrounds it, effectively separating it from the environment. This structure bears the classic characteristics of a glass dome, such as the rounded, smooth edges and high transparency that allows clear visibility of the sculpture inside.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a wooden perch beneath the sculpture with ivy vines visibly winding upward along it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a perch that resembles a wooden stump, and there are green vine-like elements seemingly winding upwards along it. These are likely representations of ivy vines, as they follow a typical upward growing pattern associated with such plants.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, stylized, crafted leaves placed around the base or near the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Around the base of the sculpture, there are small, stylized leaves that appear to be crafted from a material consistent with the rest of the mini terrarium elements, suggesting they are intentionally placed decorative objects and not naturally occurring leaves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a miniature, stylized tree stump present in the scene, positioned near the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A miniature tree stump that the sculpture is associated with is visible in the scene. This stump is stylized and appears to be an integral part of the sculptureâ€™s setting inside the dome, designed to enhance the garden or nature theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the base of the terrarium covered in a textured, earthy, moss-like material that contrasts with the blue and white colors of the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base inside the glass dome has a green, textured, and earthy appearance which resembles moss. This material contrasts with the blue and white sculpture, providing a naturistic base that adds to the visual aesthetic of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the entire scene, including the dome, perch, ivy, leaves, stump, and base, collectively evoke a garden-themed terrarium environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combined elements of the transparent glass dome, the wooden perch with ivy, crafted leaves, a tree stump, and mossy base all contribute to a miniature garden-themed display. These items, when arranged together, create a scene typical of a terrarium environment designed to evoke the imagery of a contained garden or natural setting.",
