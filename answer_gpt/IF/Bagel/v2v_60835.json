      "question": "Have the cheetahs' leg joints been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' leg joints are clearly depicted as mechanical constructs, featuring polished brass pistons and gears instead of their natural anatomy. This transformation is visually evident through the metallic sheen and structured appearance, typical of mechanical components, such as pistons and gears. The presence of these components suggests a steampunk aesthetic, where organisms are often portrayed as mechanical beings.",

      "question": "Has the cheetahs' spotted fur been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs exhibit sections of their bodies covered in what appears to be tooled leather and copper plating, replacing the natural spotted fur. This is indicated by the texture and color differences, where the usual fur pattern is interspersed with leather-like textures and metallic plating. The presence of such materials suggests an artistic integration of natural and mechanical elements.",

      "question": "Have the cheetahs' eyes been replaced with glowing amber lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' eyes do not appear to be replaced with glowing amber lenses; instead, their eyes retain their natural appearance, which is consistent with realistic animal portrayal rather than mechanical modification. The lack of any glowing or amber lens effect suggests that the eyes have not been altered in this way.",

      "question": "Are there towering, fantastical clockwork structures visible in the distant savanna horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct, towering structures in the background that resemble fantastical clockwork designs. These structures stand out due to their intricate, mechanical architecture, characteristic of steampunk or clockwork themes, contrasting starkly with the natural savanna environment typically seen in such landscapes.",

      "question": "Is the sky streaked with coppery clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted with clouds that have a coppery hue, differing from the more natural sky colors typically seen. This coppery appearance could be due to artistic editing aimed at enhancing the image's steampunk aesthetic by incorporating metallic colors into natural elements.",
