      "question": "Have all five ingredients—banana, chocolate chips, butter, eggs, and flour—been converted into chibi-style illustration stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple small, cartoon-like figures resembling bananas, a block of butter, and what could be interpreted as flour. However, there is no clear representation of chocolate chips or eggs. In Image B, the focus seems to be on only a few specific ingredients with a chibi-style rendering. Image A does not play a role in this question analysis as it focuses solely on what is present in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does each chibi-style sticker of the ingredients include both an expression and an action?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By observing Image B, many of the chibi-style stickers show fruits or food items with facial expressions like winking or smiling. However, not all of them exhibit an 'action.' For example, the bananas have facial features but lack actions like dancing or jumping, except for the central character. World knowledge tells us an action would typically involve some form of movement or gesture, which is not present in most of these stickers.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style illustration stickers exhibit cute design traits suitable for decorating a recipe notebook?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B show cute facial expressions, simple lines, and vibrant colors typical of styles suitable for decorative or playful contexts, like a recipe notebook. Drawing from world knowledge about chibi-style art, with its emphasis on cuteness and expressiveness, these traits align well with those expected in decorative items for personal notebooks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are examples of the required expressions and actions (like butter doing a peace sign, banana winking) present in their respective chibi-style illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure appears to be showing a peace sign, and one banana has a winking expression among the chibi-style stickers. These elements fit the classic 'chibi' features of exaggerated expressions and playful actions. The actual execution involves a wink and a peace sign, which are expressive gestures suitable for this art style.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style stickers maintain a cohesive and decorative style appropriate for a recipe notebook?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B follow a consistent style with similar cartoonish outlines, facial expressions, and color use, giving them a unified aesthetic appropriate for a themed collection in a recipe notebook. The cohesive design is suggested by similar artistic elements, such as the exaggerated facial features typical in chibi designs, which are widely recognized as 'cute' and appealing for decoration.",
