        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a humanoid figure with glowing eyes, a technological, intricate design with what looks like digital lines across its body, and a flowing cape-like structure, depicting a character with a sentient and magical appearance, different from the inanimate structure of the Eiffel Tower in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the figure has a glowing circular crown-like structure which resembles an energy crown rather than the pointed metallic spire of the original Eiffel Tower seen in Image A. This gives the figure a more mystical or futuristic aura.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible ring of energy at the base of the character with pixel and line-like projections, suggesting a pixelated energy barrier, contrasting with the grassy and clear base of the Eiffel Tower seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the structure retain the iron lattice design, now styled as a flowing cloak-like covering over the sorceress form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
