      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), we see six separate illustrations that resemble chibi-style figures. Each illustration includes the blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, and bangles, not just one element per figure. Therefore, not each magnet depicts only one specified element; instead, each showcases the entire outfit and accessories together.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all six magnets exhibit a vibrant, glossy surface with visible reflections or shine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi-style illustrations appear colorful and vibrant, typical of magnets designed to be visually appealing. The surface appearance does not distinctly exhibit reflections or shine characteristic of a glossy finish, which suggests that while they are colorful, they do not particularly have a shiny surface as described.",

    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all six magnets have clearly rounded edges instead of sharp corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the chibi illustrations in Image B, each has distinctly rounded edges characteristic of chibi designs. These designs often feature soft, rounded shapes rather than sharp corners, emphasizing a pleasing and child-like aesthetic, typical in chibi art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the six magnets accurately depict one of the following: the embellished purple blouse, the intricate lehenga with floral patterns, the red dupatta, the traditional jewelry, the silver bangles, or the ornate background wall pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each magnet in the edited image displays a whole figure dressed in the complete outfit with all accessories, rather than depicting just one of these individual elements per magnet. Thus, each magnet does not solely represent a single item from the list but the whole dressed figure.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all six magnets rendered in a chibi art style, featuring exaggerated proportions such as large heads and simplified facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts figures with large heads and combined simplified features, which are characteristics of the chibi art style. This art style is known for its cute and exaggerated proportions. All six illustrations follow this style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows six individual figures, each distinct and not overlapping, presented in a format that implies they could be separate collectible items. This arrangement is typical for collectible sets where each piece stands as a potential part of a larger collection, not a single unified image.",
