      "question": "Are all the original woodworking tools replaced with intricately detailed enamel replicas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools appear to be shiny and polished, suggesting a non-traditional material like enamel. The vibrant colors and smooth texture contrast with the original tools, which are metallic with a traditional appearance. This difference indicates that the tools in Image B are replicas made of a different material, likely enamel, consistent with the question's description of intricately detailed enamel replicas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer handle has a glossy, deep blue appearance, which is characteristic of enamel. The material and color noticeably stand out compared to a typical wooden handle. This observation aligns with the description of the hammer handle being rendered in deep blue enamel.",

      "question": "Do the hammer heads have a glossy metallic finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hammer head in Image B has a glossy, reflective finish similar to polished metal. This glossy finish is common in enamel or metallic materials, confirming that the hammer head indeed has a glossy metallic finish.",

      "question": "Have the wood shavings been replaced with delicate enamel curls in shades of amber and ivory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects resembling wood shavings are glossy and appear more ornamental, with shades of amber and ivory. Unlike typical wood shavings, these objects have a smoother, more polished look characteristic of enamel items. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the wood shavings have been replaced with enamel curls.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has a soft, woven appearance that resembles linen fabric. The texture is consistent with what is typically seen in linen fabric, suggesting that the tools are indeed placed on a textured linen fabric surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soft, textured appearance of the linen fabric in Image B provides a neutral and understated backdrop to the vibrant and glossy enamel tools. This combination of soft and shiny textures can create a visually pleasing contrast, helping to highlight the polished appearance of the enamel tools effectively.",
