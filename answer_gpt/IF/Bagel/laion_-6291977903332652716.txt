    "Question": "Q2: Are the timber-framed houses rendered with enhanced texture detail and colored in muted autumnal tones (e.g., browns, oranges, soft reds)?",
    "explanation": "The timber-framed houses in Image B appear to be miniatures with detailed texturing. They display colors in muted autumnal tones like browns, oranges, and soft reds, which align with typical autumn palette.
