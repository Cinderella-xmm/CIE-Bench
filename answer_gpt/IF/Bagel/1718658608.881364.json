      "question": "Is the octopus replaced by a series of curved ceramic sculptures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles an octopus with its multiple tentacles, but it appears to be crafted from a material that looks like glazed ceramic. The structure is smooth, uniform, and reflective, typical of ceramic sculptures. This indicates that the octopus has been replaced by a sculpture rather than being represented naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sculptures exhibit a glossy, reflective surface consistent with glazed ceramic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the sculptures in Image B is shiny and smooth, reflecting light in a way that is characteristic of glazed ceramic materials. This glossy finish is indicative of ceramic sculptural work.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sculptures colored in deep oceanic blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures in Image B display a deep blue color that closely resembles the tones often associated with oceanic themes. This hue is consistent throughout the sculpture, lending it an oceanic aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sculptures feature textured scales that resemble the original octopus skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures in Image B exhibit a pattern that includes scale-like textures, particularly visible on the tentacles. While the texture is not identical to a real octopus, it mimics the idea of a textured surface similar to octopus skin, but stylized for sculptural effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is plain, with a smooth, sandy-colored appearance. It does not show any particular natural textures or features, creating a clean backdrop for the sculptures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a harmonious wave pattern that reflects the motion of ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the sculptures in Image B suggests a flowing, curved form that resembles the natural motion of ocean waves. The tentacles are positioned in a manner that implies movement and harmony, typical of such an arrangement.",
