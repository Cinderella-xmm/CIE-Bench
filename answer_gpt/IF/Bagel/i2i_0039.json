      "question": "Does the edited version retain the original photo subjects (polar bear and cubs in an icy setting)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we still see the polar bear and two cubs standing on ice. The background and context of the subjects have not been altered, indicating they remain in an icy setting. Image A, which also shows polar bears on ice, confirms that the subjects have been retained. Therefore, the edited version retains the original subjects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the color tone of the image been slightly cooled to include more blue and white hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, compared to a neutral or warm tone, there's a predominance of blue and white hues, giving a cooler appearance overall. This signifies a cooling effect applied in the editing process. Without comparing it directly to Image A, we can conclude from the current tones and hues in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bold headline reading “Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.” located in the top right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is prominent text visible at the top that initially appears to say 'Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.' upon first glance, though some letters are stylized. Without analyzing Image A, which lacks such text due to being the original, we establish from these visible letters that a headline has been added.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features logos and text at the bottom, which typically represent organizations or websites. These elements are absent in Image A, indicating that they were added during editing to form part of a possible promotional or awareness campaign.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features added text and logos but still portrays a realistic and serious depiction of the polar bears in an icy setting. The style does not include elements typical of cartoons or exaggerated graphics, maintaining the photograph's original serious tone.",
