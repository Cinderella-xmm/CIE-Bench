      "question": "Have the individuals waiting at the train station been converted into 3D chibi-style characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals at the train station display characteristics that are typical of 3D chibi-style characters. These include large heads, small bodies, and simplified facial features which are typical for this style. Such features are a departure from realistic human proportions and appearances seen in the original image, where the individuals are depicted with realistic anatomy and proportions. This transformation indicates a stylistic change to a chibi format.",

      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style characters in the same positions as the original individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the 3D chibi-style characters roughly corresponds to where the individuals are standing in Image A. The characters are located along the train platform, reflecting a similar spatial arrangement to the original image where the individuals were depicted. Although distinct style changes occurred, the relative positions along the platform remain consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style characters retain the original outfits and postures of the individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the clothing style of the chibi characters reflects the general style of modest, early 20th-century attire, it is simplified in line with the chibi aesthetic. Similarly, while postures are retained, they are less detailed due to the simplified, exaggerated features typical of chibi characters. The overall impression of clothing and posture is consistent, but simplification in the chibi style results in a less detailed representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the train and station backdrop remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the train and station backdrop in a 3D cartoon style, which simplifies and stylizes the elements seen in Image A. The train and station structures match the physical arrangement and design seen in the original but are rendered with simplified lines and colors. Thus, while the core elements are retained, the style has significantly changed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters display 3D qualities like depth and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters exhibit characteristics typical of 3D rendering, such as depth and shading. The characters are not flat; rather, they have volumetric attributes, and the shading enhances the perception of three-dimensionality. These features are consistent with 3D rendering, differentiating them from flat or 2D styles.",
