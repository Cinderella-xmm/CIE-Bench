    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pie depicted with human-like features such as a face and limbs, resembling a fussy old librarian?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie is anthropomorphized with human-like features including eyes, eyebrows, and a nose, which are positioned on the pie itself. It also has limbs and is dressed in clothing resembling a librarian's attire, giving it human characteristics and a resemblance to a fussy old librarian. This depiction is achieved through a cartoonish style that exaggerates human traits on an inanimate object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the knife been visually altered to resemble a feather pen, and is it being held by the pie character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object held by the pie character is indeed a knife, consistent with the handle and blade shape typical of a knife. There are no alterations that make it resemble a feather pen. The pie character holds the knife in one hand as if pointing or directing with it, but there are no features that suggest a transformation into a feather pen.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lattice crust pattern visible on the pie character as a patterned apron, draped over its lower half?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie character is wearing an apron, and while there is a patterned element to it, it is not explicitly the lattice pattern of pie crust. The pattern on the apron does have squares, but doesn't mimic the exact lattice design commonly found on pies. This representation merges the aspects of a pie with additional elements like clothing.",

      "question": "Does Scene 1 display the text “Hush! Respect the quiet crust.” and feature other pastry characters appearing to chatter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text in Scene 1 reads “HHDL......! RECTSCT PRUTES.” This wording does not exactly match “Hush! Respect the quiet crust.” Furthermore, there are no other pastry characters depicted as chattering in the scene; it solely features the anthropomorphic pie character holding a knife.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does Scene 2 contain the text “You’ll get a slice of silence!” and show the feather pen positioned above the pie in a stern, hovering manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Scene 2 contains the text “YOU'LL GET GA SIINNEE SIIUES!” which is a different phrasing from “You’ll get a slice of silence!” Additionally, the object is a knife and not a feather pen. The knife is raised, indicating a stern gesture by the character, but it is not positioned in a hovering manner as described.",

      "question": "Is the image composed as a two-panel comic strip with distinct scene divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is composed of four distinct panels rather than two. Each panel contains a separate scene or part of the story, characterized by its own text and actions. This layout indicates a multi-panel comic strip rather than just two scenes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rendered in a cartoonish and illustrative style. The presence of exaggerated features, bold outlines, and colorful stylization all contribute to a comic-like appearance, distinguishing it from photorealism which focuses on detailed, lifelike representation.",
