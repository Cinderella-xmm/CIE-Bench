    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the motorcycle composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a motorcycle constructed from LEGO bricks. The visible bricks on the model primarily appear in black and blue colors. This suggests that the motorcycle in Image B is almost entirely composed of these two colors, which are commonly used for LEGO constructions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the angular design features of the original motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model of the motorcycle exhibits distinct angular features, typical of block-based constructions like LEGO, which align with the design seen in the original motorcycle from Image A. LEGO's inherent design constraints naturally result in an angular appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wheel rims replaced with intricate cog patterns typical of LEGO mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheel rims of the LEGO model feature cog-like patterns, which are characteristic of detailed LEGO mechanical parts. This differs from the more standard, smooth rims usually found on actual motorcycles like in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original decals represented as colorful printed tiles on the LEGO model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no colorful printed tiles are visible that would represent the decals found on the original motorcycle in Image A. The LEGO model seems to focus on the color scheme using standard LEGO bricks without specific decals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model placed on a smooth gray baseplate with directional arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model is positioned on a gray baseplate that features directional arrows. This detail provides a display-like presentation which enhances the aesthetic of the construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the blue and black stripes follow the same dynamic flow and positioning as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue and black color scheme exists, but due to the nature of LEGO bricks, the stripes do not follow the identical flow or positioning found on the original motorcycle in Image A, where decals create precise lines and patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model displayed within a clean, enclosed display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO model encased in a clear, enclosed display, contributing to an organized and presentable appearance that showcases the modelâ€™s design.",
