      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug displays characteristics typical of a wooden sculpture, such as rigid, carved features indicative of woodwork rather than the softness of a living dog's fur and skin. The representation has deliberate, smooth lines that define its form, resembling a sculpture. This makes it clear that the subject is a wooden carving instead of a living animal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the fur been replaced with smooth, polished wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual appearance of the pug in Image B shows smooth, continuous surfaces with a texture that resembles wood grain, lacking the definition and individual strands typically associated with fur. This strong visual cue, combined with the common characteristic of polished wood sculptures, indicates that the fur has been replaced by a wood grain texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B displays warm brown tones commonly associated with walnut wood, whereas Image A has the natural coloring of a pug with fawn and black patterns. While Image B maintains a monochrome wooden color scheme typical in walnut, it doesn't follow the pug's original color pattern as seen in Image A, where multiple colors represent different parts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pug's facial features in Image B are defined by precise, etched lines, characteristic of carvings. This contrasts with the relaxed, soft folds of skin seen in Image A. The crafted approach seen in Image B replaces natural skin textures with intentional carvings that outline the distinctive features of the pug's face.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden pug placed on a simple black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the bottom of the sculpture resting on a simple, stark black platform. This base serves as a typical display stand often used to highlight sculptures, distinguishing them from their surroundings and serving almost like a pedestal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the black base provide a stark contrast to the rich wood texture of the sculpture, emphasizing its craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dark, minimalist black base in Image B effectively offsets the warm, rich tones of the woodwork, creating a distinct visual contrast that serves to highlight and emphasize the intricacies of the carving. This stark contrast is a common technique to draw attention to the artistry and detail of sculptures.",
