      "question": "Is the horse sculpture enclosed in a transparent box that allows full visibility of its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse sculpture is enclosed in a glass or transparent box, which provides full visibility from all angles.

      "question": "Are there visible gold-colored decorative elements or trim on the transparent showcase box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays gold-colored trim around the edges of the transparent box. This trim serves a decorative purpose, adding elegance and a touch of luxury to the display case.

      "question": "Is a modern and elegantly designed brand logo visible on the black base stand beneath the showcase box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Though Image B does feature design elements related to branding, these are located on the transparent box rather than the black base of the stand. The base itself lacks a visible brand logo, focusing instead on supporting the showcased sculpture. In modern product design, logos are often placed in visible areas such as the backdrop or sides, not necessarily the base unless intended solely for brand reinforcement.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a backdrop with a pattern resembling traditional Chinese art motifs, an element often employed in designs aiming to evoke cultural heritage and authenticity. These motifs can serve both an aesthetic purpose and underline the cultural significance of the item displayed as part of a cohesive visual narrative.",

      "question": "Does the showcase box have a seamless, flush closure suggesting a magnetic mechanism rather than a hinge or latch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the transparent box features a clean design with no visible hinge or latch, which might suggest the use of a magnetic closure. This style is commonly used in modern display cases to maintain streamlined aesthetics and ensure easy access without disrupting the viewer's focus on the item within.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B reveals that they depict different sculptures. Image A shows an antique terracotta horse, while Image B showcases a modern, pristine sculpture made of a different material. The enclosure in Image B provides clear visibility but is not displaying the original horse from Image A, indicating a difference in presentation or curation.",
