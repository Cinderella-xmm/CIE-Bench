      "question": "Is the elephant enclosed within a visible glass display case with ornate framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the elephant enclosed within a glass display case. The case itself features a circular, transparent glass exterior, topped with a wooden frame. The framing appears ornate with its detailed design and golden accents, indicating it is not just a plain glass case but one that adds aesthetic and decorative value to the display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the elephant been scaled down to a miniature size relative to the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the elephant is placed inside a glass display case and surrounded by small bonsai trees. The visual proportions suggest that the elephant has been miniaturized to fit the enclosed space comfortably, making it appear smaller relative to the case's overall height and the accompanying bonsai trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible golden inlays integrated into the surface of the elephant sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an intricately designed elephant sculpture. However, upon close examination, there are no visible golden inlays on the elephant itself. The patterning and texture suggest a more uniform wooden or bronze-like material without distinct golden highlights.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple tiny bonsai trees positioned around the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observation reveals that several small bonsai trees are positioned around the elephant within the glass display case. These trees are miniature by nature, accentuating the size of the elephant, which is also miniaturized, thus supporting the idea of a delicately crafted display.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the scene surrounding the elephant filled with a dense, miniature jungle rendered in vibrant, earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant surrounded primarily by bonsai trees, which are spaced to balance the composition rather than form a dense jungle. The color palette is warm and earthy, harmonizing with the elephant and display case, but it is not indicative of a dense jungle setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the base resemble a smooth, polished stone with visible engraved floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is clearly discernible as being intricately decorated, with visible floral patterns engraved. The appearance of the base is more akin to a polished wood or crafted metal, featuring these fine details rather than looking like natural stone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all elements in the scene—glass case, bonsai, jungle, base, and elephant—harmonize in style and color to create a cohesive, elegant natural theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a composed display where all elements—the glass case, bonsai trees, base, and elephant—are designed with a cohesive style. The color scheme involves earthy and warm tones, giving the scene a harmonious and elegant appearance, aligning with a natural theme.",
