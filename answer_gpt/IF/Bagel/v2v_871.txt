    "Question": "Q1: Is the image vertically oriented?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation can be judged by examining the aspect ratio and positioning of the elements within the frame. The LEGO minifigure and the pear-inspired animal seem to be standing next to each other inside a transparent glass cube. Their vertical arrangement suggests that the image is more vertically oriented since both figures fit comfortably within the frame in a standing position, indicating more height than width.",
