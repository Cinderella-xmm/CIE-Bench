        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the core visual elements from Image A, such as the swirling night sky, stars, and cypress tree, have been replicated in the wall sticker design.

      "question": "Is the glow-in-the-dark effect visible on the wall sticker depiction, indicating that it would illuminate in dark conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows parts of the wall sticker depicting a greenish glow, typically associated with glow-in-the-dark materials. This hue is more vibrant in areas like the stars and the swirling patterns, suggesting these sections would illuminate in the dark, replicating a glow-in-the-dark effect.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bed with pillows and a duvet is visible, indicating a bedroom setting. The wall behind the bed features the wall sticker, consistent with the idea of applying a decorative element to a feature wall commonly found in bedrooms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall sticker is placed on the wall directly behind the bed, which is a logical and typical choice for a feature wall in a bedroom. This placement allows for the wall sticker to serve both as a decorative element and a potential source of ambient glow-in-the-dark lighting, making it an appropriate and consistent choice for the bedroom setting.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic style characterized by swirling patterns, bold brushstrokes, and vibrant colors is evident in Image B, mirroring the original painting's style in Image A. This preservation of style maintains the aesthetic integrity of the artwork despite the adaptation into a wall sticker format.",
