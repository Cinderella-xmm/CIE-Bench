      "question": "Does the image feature a gradient background with pastel colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background primarily exhibits vivid neon pink, purple, and blue hues rather than soft, muted pastel colors. These colors are characteristic of a bold, vibrant style rather than the softer tones typically associated with pastels. The use of these colors suggests a more intense visual impact, which is common in designs aimed at creating eye-catching aesthetics rather than the gentle, soothing effect of pastels.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is surrounded by bright and colorful neon lighting, evident in the luminous pink and purple lights outlining its frame.

      "question": "Has the overall bathroom scene been transformed into a retro-futuristic style characteristic of vaporwave?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly exhibits elements typical of vaporwave, a style known for its use of neon colors, retro-futuristic themes, and digital aesthetic. The neon lighting around the mirror, the vibrant color palette, and the overall ambiance make it visually aligned with the vaporwave aesthetic, which often combines elements of the past with futuristic digital culture.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is filled with vivid and consistent neon colors, primarily pink and purple, which spread across the entire scene. The application is uniform, creating a coherent aesthetic across the different surfaces and elements within the scene, including walls and reflections. This consistency is key in maintaining the visual coherence typical of certain stylistic approaches.",

      "question": "Do the original objects like the mirror, sink, and cabinet retain their form but now reflect a vaporwave design influence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects such as the mirror, sink, and cabinet retain their original physical forms as seen in Image A, but they have been visually enhanced to reflect a vaporwave influence. This primarily occurs through the addition of neon lighting effects and the vibrant color scheme. The edit transforms these elements to fit within a new aesthetic without altering their fundamental shapes or structures from Image A.",
