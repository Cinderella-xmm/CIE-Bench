    "Question": "Q5: Is the robotic dog designed with features such as metallic textures or mechanical parts, making it identifiable as a robot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration of the dog within the parking meter's timer area is styled in a cartoonish manner but has distinct mechanical features such as a metallic sheen, jointed limbs, and what appears to be mechanical components.
