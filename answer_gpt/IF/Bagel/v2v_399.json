      "question": "Has the vase been replaced with a structure composed entirely of flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is visibly transformed into a structure composed entirely of flowers and floral elements. This is evident through visual cues that show the form typically occupied by a vase now covered in flower petals and buds, suggesting a complete conversion from the original material, which was a metal vase. The floral structure creates a new design, indicating that the vase's conventional material has been substituted with floral elements.",

      "question": "Do the floral details follow and blend with the contours of the vase's original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows that the floral details are arranged in a way that follows and complements the contours of the vase's shape as seen in Image A. Although the materials and design have changed, the floral structure conforms to the general outline of a vase, suggesting a continuity in shape despite the transformation in material and surface detail.",

      "question": "Does the design prioritize artistic and imaginative expression over functional realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B emphasizes an artistic and imaginative approach by converting a realistic vase into a floral representation. This expression focuses on creativity rather than practicality, as a vase composed entirely of flowers is impractical for its usual function of holding items but visually striking and imaginative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a vase entirely transformed into an arrangement of flowers, differing from the conventional appearance of a vase as seen in Image A. By replacing the traditional material with floral elements, the transformation displays an innovative interpretation that ventures beyond typical vase designs.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the general shape and structure of the original vase seen in Image A, although with a transformed surface made of flowers. The resemblance in silhouette implies retention of original basic shape, despite a complete change in material and style.",
