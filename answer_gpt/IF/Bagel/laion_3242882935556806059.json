      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the lily flowers now composed of transparent, amber-tinted crystal-like material with visible jagged facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers have been transformed from the original organic appearance to a material that resembles crystal. The petals show a translucent and reflective quality, similar to how crystal can appear, with facets that catch the light. The amber tint is present in some petals, giving them a warm hue while maintaining the overall transparent quality. This visual transformation suggests they are now crafted from crystal-like materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the petals retain their original lily shape but appear constructed from layered, sharp-edged crystal facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral structure maintains the outlines of a flower but each petal is now rendered with sharp edges and a faceted appearance typical of cut crystal. This change indicates that while the general shape of the flowers (similar to lilies) is preserved, they are composed of crystal, displaying layered and sharply defined facets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the green stems and leaves been completely replaced with delicate, transparent glass rods extending from the vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stems appear as thin and transparent rods that associate more with glass in terms of their clarity and delicacy, differing from the organic green stems of the lily in Image A. These rods extend smoothly from the vase, suggesting that they are not natural plant material but crafted from a glass-like substance, completing the transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bouquet placed on a smooth, dark black surface with visible marble veining, indicating a black marble tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the vase has a consistent black color with distinct, lighter veining patterns which are characteristic of marble. Such visual cues indicate that the surface is indeed a black marble tabletop. The veins add to the luxurious and smooth appearance typical of marble, contrasting the bright crystal flowers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire composition—crystal flowers, glass stems, and black marble base—create a cohesive, elegant, and crafted aesthetic consistent with fine art objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B combines the intricately faceted, crystal-like flowers and the clear glass stems, all set on a sophisticated black marble surface. These elements together evoke an artistic and crafted appearance, characteristic of fine art objects, with attention to detail and harmony in materials and design, creating a visually cohesive and elegant piece.",
