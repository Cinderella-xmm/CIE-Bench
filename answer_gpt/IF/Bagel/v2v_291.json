      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central characters are a hippo and a rabbit, which appear to be standing closely and facing forward. They are stylized in a 3D cartoon form, suggesting a chibi-style depiction that emphasizes cuteness. The characters are placed prominently in the center of the card design. Comparatively, Image A shows a real-life hippo and rabbit, but their positioning and realistic portrayal are distinct from the cartoon representation in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the image rendered in a 3D cartoon style with gentle lighting and cozy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a clear 3D cartoon style that gives it a chibi aesthetic, with smooth textures and exaggerated features that are characteristic of such a style. The lighting is soft, creating a cozy atmosphere that aligns with the warm tones visible in the image. This is different from Image A, which depicts a realistic setting with natural lighting.",

      "question": "Are there visible stats or skill bars included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is text beneath the characters with numerical values and abbreviations that resemble stats or skill indicators. This format is common in card games, where characters have attributes shown as numbers and symbols. Contrarily, Image A doesn't incorporate such elements because it's a real-life photograph.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a title banner at the top with some text, which likely represents a name or title, and a design element at the bottom resembling a nameplate. Such features are typical in card design, providing a structured layout for information. This differs from Image A, which is a standard photo without added text or graphics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B shows a blurred setting with earthy green and warm tones, simulating a nature-inspired environment. The backdrop complements the cartoonish style while maintaining coherence with the theme. In contrast, Image A has a more realistic background of natural terrain and subdued colors.",
