      "question": "Has the overall scene been resized and framed vertically to resemble a bookmark format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears to have been resized and framed to fit a narrow, vertical format, which is characteristic of a bookmark. The layout is linear and tall, emphasizing verticality in contrast to Image A's wider aspect, where the focus is on a horizontal line of sight. The change in format can be attributed to the longer frame and positioning of the elements such as the man and decorative flourishes within these dimensions.",

      "question": "Does the man's robe feature abstract geometric patterns rendered in muted earth tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's robe is depicted with abstract geometric patterns in shades of brown, black, and white, which are typical of earth tones. These patterns contrast with Image A, where the man's robe is a solid color typical of traditional robes without such patterns. This transformation contributes to the illustration style and makes the robe visually distinct in Image B.",

      "question": "Have the lamps been transformed into decorative corner flourishes with intricate design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what were functional lamps in Image A have been reimagined into stylized decorative elements. These corner flourishes incorporate ornate and intricate design motifs, serving a purely aesthetic purpose compared to the practical lighting function in the original image. This transition enhances the overall decorative and artistic appearance of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the bookcase extended into a textured background that includes subtle script elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookcase from Image A is no longer present. Instead, the background features a textured surface with intricate script or calligraphic details. This change creates a flat yet visually rich background that does not replicate the structured arrangement of books seen in Image A. The use of script elements adds depth and complexity to the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there clearly defined blank spaces or margins in the image suitable for placing inspirational quotes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes defined spaces or margins that stand out against the decorative and textual background. Specifically, the areas around the man and the top section within the border are less visually dense, providing potential space for additional text or quotes without overwhelming the existing visual elements. This intentional use of space is typical in designs intended for personalizing with text.",
