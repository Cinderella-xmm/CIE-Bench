      "question": "Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and the banana remain distinct entities placed adjacent to each other without any signs of blending or merging into a single form. The visual separation between the two objects is clear, as the dog and banana do not overlap or show any modification to suggest they have been combined into a unified shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the dog and banana are not actually blended into a single form in Image B, the question of a realistic appearance of a blended form does not apply. Both objects maintain their individual appearance without any signs of manipulation intended to combine them into one form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no transition between the dog and the banana because they are not merged or blended. They appear as separate entities without any connective manipulation or alteration that would require a seamless transition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and banana are separate objects with clearly different proportions. The banana is disproportionately large compared to the dog, which gives a humorous effect but is not realistic in terms of their natural sizes relative to each other. As such, since there is no blended form, the proportions and scale are not consistent with reality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows in Image B appear consistent across both the dog and banana, suggesting that they were captured under the same lighting conditions. The light source, shadow direction, and intensity align correctly with the original conditions seen in Image A, preserving a natural look despite the exaggerated scale difference.",
