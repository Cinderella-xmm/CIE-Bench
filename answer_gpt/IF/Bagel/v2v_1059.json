      "question": "Do the zebras appear as charming chibi-style 3D figures with oversized, adorable traits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras have exaggerated, cute features characteristic of chibi style, such as large eyes and small bodies, which are common in stylized and cartoon-like designs. This interpretation is based on recognizing the intentional artistic style used to make the zebras look more adorable and toy-like.",

      "question": "Do the zebras retain their signature striped coats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are depicted with their characteristic black and white striped patterns, which are iconic to zebras regardless of the art style used. This shows a maintenance of key identifying features while applying a stylized approach.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the zebras shown in realistic grazing stances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows zebras in poses that suggest grazing, the stances are stylized rather than realistic. The chibi art style tends to exaggerate and simplify forms, which can affect the natural appearance of positions and movements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding elements like the field and fencing are depicted in a more animated and less detailed manner, maintaining a cohesive artistic style consistent with the chibi zebras. The setting lacks photorealistic texture and detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a visible ornate decorative frame surrounding the scene, suggesting a presentation style akin to a framed picture or artwork. This addition is not present in Image A and adds a distinction to the edited image.",
