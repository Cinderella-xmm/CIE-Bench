      "question": "Does the edited image include the front, left side, and top views of both refrigerators?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts two refrigerators from the front with a slight angle, giving a partial side view but not a full left side view, and there is no visibility of the top view. Typically, for a full top view, the image would need to be captured from above, and for a full left side view, the refrigerators would need to be oriented completely sideways, neither of which are present in the edited image. Thus, it only shows the front with a slight perspective of the left side, not fulfilling the requirement for all three views.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, the proportions and design details such as the handles, water dispensers, and overall dimensions appear consistent and natural, without any evident distortion.

      "explanation": "The edited image of the refrigerators is free from extraneous objects or elements that could distract from the main subjects.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image demonstrates a high level of resolution and clarity, evident by the sharpness of details like the stainless steel finish, handles, and control panels.
