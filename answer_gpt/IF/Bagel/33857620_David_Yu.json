    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the entire alpine scene transformed into a unified, creature-like form rather than separate landscape elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an enormous, fantastical creature occupies the majority of the foreground, suggesting a transformation from the prior landscape elements observed in Image A. The head and limbs of the creature blend with elements like rock and snow, creating a cohesive entity rather than distinct natural elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chalet's roof visibly transformed into a shell-like structure with intricate, icy etching patterns covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an ice-like shell with intricate patterns, which appears to cover the top of the creature-like structure. If we consider the location of the chalet from Image A, this shell could represent a transformation of the chalet's roof, accentuated with the described patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the former snow patches now shaped like wings and rendered with a shimmering, translucent appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not depict the snow patches as wings. Instead, the creature's appendages are more tentacle-like, glowing with a blue hue, and are distinct from any wing-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rocky areas at the base of the scene appear as thick, leg-like structures covered in mossy textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's legs or appendages appear to be glowing limbs rather than rocky or mossy textures. Therefore, the rocky areas are not transformed into thick, moss-covered leg-like structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stream depicted as glowing, luminous lines resembling veins embedded within the creatureâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stream in Image A was a natural water flow through rocks, whereas in Image B, there's a significant transformation where the creature has luminous, vein-like structures especially in its limbs, but these aren't a direct transformation of the stream itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall atmosphere of the image misty, hazy, and dreamlike, with soft lighting and a sense of otherworldliness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains a misty and hazy atmosphere, with soft lighting that gives it a surreal, dreamlike quality, enhanced by the presence of the fantastical creature.",
