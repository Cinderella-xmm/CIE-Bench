    "Question": "Q1: Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are six illustrations depicting a sequence of movements related to tennis. Each illustration represents a distinct stage of a tennis stroke, often including preparation, swing, hit, and follow-through. However, since there are more than four frames depicted, the question about specifically only four frames is not accurate.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the illustration drawn in clean line art style?",
    "explanation": "Image B features illustrations that are created using clear, bold lines with no additional shading, details, or colors, typical of a clean line art style. This approach emphasizes the outline and form of the figures without any extra textures or colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the illustration use monochrome color fill?",
    "explanation": "The image is composed entirely of simple black lines on a white background, with no use of any additional colors or shading within the figures or the background. This strict use of black and white is consistent with a monochrome color fill.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the background been completely removed from the illustration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely white with no additional elements or visual distractions, allowing the line art figures to stand out clearly. This indicates that any background has been entirely removed or not included in the illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Is the 4-frame illustration arranged in a horizontal format as an instructional strip?",
    "explanation": "The images in Image B are arranged in two rows of three frames each, meaning they are not aligned horizontally as one continuous strip. Rather than being a straightforward horizontal instructional strip, this arrangement is more of a grid layout.",
    "answer": "No"
