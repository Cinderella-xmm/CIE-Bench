      "question": "Is the cactus transformed into a creature-like form with distinct features such as a face, body, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a creature rather than a simple cactus. The creature has distinct features, including a face with eyes, a body covered in scales, and limbs, which are indicative of a creature-like form. This transformation is quite evident due to the presence of these anatomical features, contrasting with a typical cactus appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the creature’s scales feature patterns and colors matching those on the sombrero’s brim, such as floral and geometric designs in vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sombrero in Image B does have intricate designs, but the scales on the creature itself are distinct in texture and color. The scales appear in gold and blue without directly replicating the vibrant floral or geometric designs present on the sombrero’s brim. Therefore, the patterns and colors of the sombrero and the scales do not match in this manner.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the terracotta pot been replaced with a stone-like base that serves as the creature’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base where the creature stands appears to be a stone-like platform, different from the Image A's terracotta pot. This stone base seems to naturally integrate with the creature’s feet, suggesting it has taken on a more creature-oriented stance as opposed to being potted.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spines replaced with golden, shimmering quills that appear reflective or luminous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has golden, shimmering features that resemble quills projecting outward. These are reflective and contrast significantly with the red spines on the cactus seen in Image A. The reflective nature suggests a transformation into something more extraordinary and ornamental.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible, flowing sandy aura surrounding the creature, composed of particle-like textures resembling drifting sand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible sandy aura or particle-like texture in Image B surrounding the creature. The background appears plain and does not include elements that convey a drifting sand effect. The emphasis is primarily on the creature itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the creature’s eyes appear as bright, gem-like orbs with topaz-like coloration and reflective highlights, conveying a serene and watchful gaze?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B does have large, gem-like eyes. These eyes exhibit a bright, reflective quality with a coloration that could be associated with topaz. The highlights and expression do give off a serene and watchful gaze, aligning with the description.",
