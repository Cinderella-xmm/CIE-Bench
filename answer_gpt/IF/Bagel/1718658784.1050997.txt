    "Question": "Q1: Does the cake feature bold, graphic icing patterns such as geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs instead of realistic frosting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cake on the pedestal is depicted with simplified, stylized patterns that appear as bold horizontal stripes. These stripes are characteristic of graphic, repetitive motifs rather than the intricate, realistic frosting texture seen in natural images. This conclusion is drawn from recognizing the pop-art style known for bold patterns and flat colors.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the balloons composed of vivid monochrome dots rather than solid colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are shown in solid, bold colors typical of pop-art style, rather than being made up of dots. These balloons are consistent with the flat color aesthetic commonly seen in pop art. By contrasting the solid color balloons seen here with dotted patterns, it is clear the image chooses solid color representation.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the candle flame have exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow?",
    "explanation": "The candle flame in Image B is shown with sharp, defined edges and bright, saturated colors, deviating from the soft, flickering natural flame typically seen. This representation aligns with the exaggerated and stylized approach found in pop art, where natural elements are often rendered in vivid, unnatural colors and distinct outlines.",

    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a pop-art style throughout the composition, characterized by the use of flat, vibrant colors, bold outlines, and simplified graphical representations of objects such as the cake, balloons, table, and vase. This consistent application of flatness, bright colors, and outlined forms is central to pop art, aiming for simplicity and high visual impact.",
