        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been dramatically altered from its original earthy setting to include elements that visually resemble snow and icebergs. The shades of blue and white in the background of Image B are characteristic of icy environments, which is clearly different from the earthy backdrop seen in Image A. The editing gives the impression of an arctic or cold setting due to the color scheme and textures representing ice formations.",

      "question": "Are the carrots still rooted in soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the carrots appear to be embedded in soil. Their bases are surrounded by dark, gritty material that is recognizable as soil in both images. Despite the change in background elements in Image B, the carrots remain partially submerged in soil, which indicates they are still rooted in it.",

      "question": "Do the carrots retain their original appearance in terms of color and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots in Image B maintain the same visual appearance as those in Image A. They have the same vibrant orange color and typical carrot shape, with distinct greens sprouting from the top. There are no apparent alterations to the color or the basic form of the carrots themselves when comparing both images.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image show a clear contrast between the Arctic background and the soil around the carrots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a notable contrast between the dark soil in which the carrots are rooted and the bright, icy background. This contrast is enhanced by the colors and textures that highlight the difference between the two distinct environments, with the soil being dark brown and the background being predominantly white and blue, resembling ice and snow.",

      "question": "Is the overall setting of the image consistent with an Arctic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is altered to include icy blue and white elements that suggest an Arctic landscape, including snow and iceberg-like formations. However, the presence of soil and carrot growth contradicts what is typically found in an actual Arctic environment. While the background simulates Arctic conditions, the incongruity with the foreground elements like soil and carrots makes the overall setting inconsistent with a true Arctic environment.",
