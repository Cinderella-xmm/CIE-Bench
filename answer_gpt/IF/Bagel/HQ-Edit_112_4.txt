    "Question": "Q1: Is the Blue Jay rendered as a miniature sculpture made of a solid material such as ceramic or metal, rather than a live bird?",
    "explanation": "The Blue Jay in Image B appears stylized, with clear material properties that suggest it is solid and not a live bird. The texture of the object, along with its smooth, shiny, and reflective surface, indicates it is made from a solid material like ceramic or a painted metal. The rigid appearance and lack of organic detail typically seen in a live bird further support this observation.",
