      "question": "Does the edited image contain two distinct panels depicting different scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly four distinct sections divided by borders, showcasing different visual scenes and events. This segmentation into four sections inherently indicates multiple panels, though the question asked about two, suggesting there might be some confusion. Given that these are distinct, separate panels telling parts of a narrative, the two-panel form might be part of simplifying the description, but ultimately, Image B does indeed have more than two distinct panels.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the largest tortilla chip depicted as an anthropomorphic character with a monocle and a curious expression, peeking around a corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chip depicted in Image B as an anthropomorphic character does not have a monocle or exhibit a curious expression; rather, it has eyes with expressive features. The character is drawn in a cartoonish, friendly manner suggesting emotional expressions. Therefore, there is no indication of a monocle or specifically curious behavior in peeking around a corner.",

      "question": "Is the guacamole mound depicted as an anthropomorphic character holding a tiny avocado cup and showing an excited expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic character representing the guacamole is indeed drawn with facial features, a smile suggesting excitement, and it appears to hold something green, resembling a tiny avocado cup, fitting the description. The expression of enthusiasm is evident from its wide-open, friendly eyes and mouth.",

      "question": "Does Panel 1 feature a rustic kitchen setting with a visible spice rack near the tortilla chip character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's first panel does show a backdrop that includes shelves with what seem to be containers, possibly spices or ingredients, establishing a kitchen-like setting. Therefore, the description of a rustic kitchen with a visible spice rack aligns with what is seen in the panel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does Panel 2 show a festive kitchen table with mini flag banners and at least one other dip character being invited by the guacamole character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's panels, there is one that includes a festive table setup with mini flag banners. However, a direct invitation from the guacamole character to another dip character is not explicitly depicted; rather, we see the guacamole character seeming to participate in a festivity. The understanding of invitation might come from contextual reading more than visual cues directly suggesting another dip character. Thus, this interpretation is somewhat speculative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is indeed soft and muted, using light pastel shades for backgrounds and character elements. This choice of palette gives the comic a gentle and pleasant visual mood.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dialogue bubbles are evident, containing text that aims to be humorous with intentionally garbled words, suggesting a playful tone. This choice aligns with common comedic tropes in comics where characters engage in light-hearted, funny exchanges.",
