        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the Funko Pop-style box is depicted at an angle that allows viewers to see both the front and one of the sides. This perspective is characteristic of an isometric view, which provides a three-dimensional appearance without using perspective distortion. The front and the side of the box are visible, clearly supporting the idea that it's presented in an isometric view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing the edited image, the chibi-style figure indeed holds a bat in its hand and wears a helmet on its head. This portrayal is typical for a baseball player figure, as a bat and helmet are standard elements associated with baseball. Thus, the observation confirms the presence of both the bat and helmet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi-style figure is accompanied by a glove, which can be seen on one of its hands, while two small baseballs are placed next to it. These elements are iconic for a baseball player, demonstrating key elements that represent the sport. The presence of both a glove and baseballs confirms that these signature items are included.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure placed outside of the box in the edited image is designed in a highly stylized, chibi form with smooth textures typical of Funko Pop figures, rather than realistic textures and lighting. The design focuses on exaggerated proportions and a simplistic aesthetic instead of realism, indicating that it is not a realistic depiction.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text on the front of the packaging in the edited image prominently reads 'BASEBALL LEGEND.' This title is consistent with the theme of the product, which is a chibi-style figure of a baseball player. The clear and legible text confirms that the packaging is indeed titled 'BASEBALL LEGEND.'",
