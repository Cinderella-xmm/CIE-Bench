      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, there is no visible glass or transparent structure enclosing the entire scene. The scene appears to be set in an open environment without any boundaries or enclosing perimeters. Common characteristics of a glass terrarium, such as a transparent dome or enclosure, are not present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-capped peaks made of visibly textured and glittering materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-capped peaks have a distinct textured appearance, and they exhibit a visual quality that suggests glittering, likely produced by a sparkling effect or material. This can be perceived from the way the peaks reflect light and appear to have a synthetic texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the landscape feature intricately detailed, fine-brushed foliage instead of natural-looking vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases foliage that resembles miniature, stylized models rather than natural, organic vegetation. The trees appear to be crafted with precision, similar to those found in model train or diorama landscapes, suggesting a fine-brushed or artificially detailed look rather than a realistic depiction of trees.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lake represented by a reflective, translucent resin-like surface with a synthetic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the lake has a highly reflective and smooth quality, akin to resin or acrylic with a glossy finish. This appearance differs from natural water bodies, which usually have varying textures and less uniform reflections, suggesting a synthetic sheen.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts small, detailed structures resembling chalets or cabins along the shoreline. These figurines have precise, miniature design elements characteristic of model buildings, indicating that they are artificial and intentionally detailed for aesthetic emphasis in a model-like landscape setting.",
