      "question": "Does the image feature warm tones and soft lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background color is a warm golden hue which typically evokes a warm tone feeling. The lighting on the character is soft, as evidenced by the absence of harsh shadows and the smooth gradients. Warm tones and soft lighting are often used to create a welcoming and gentle atmosphere.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image is presented as a card-like design with information about 'Coding Ceadny'. However, no programmer-related tools such as code fragments or keyboards are visibly integrated into the artwork. The image focuses more on the character depiction and personal statistics rather than showing such tools.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has sections under 'Creatiny: Aant/T' which show metrics possibly relating to some form of skills or abilities. However, the exact details like 'Coding +10' and 'Creativity +8' aren't seen. The format suggests some form of statistical representation, but they don't align precisely with those specific increments.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a title banner at the top that says 'Coding Ceadny' and the style is polished with clear borders. However, there is no nameplate at the bottom, only some textual information regarding skills or stats.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B predominantly uses warm, neutral tones that contrast with but also complement the character's vivid purple hair and black clothing. Complimentary schemes often involve contrasting yet harmonious tones to highlight features, which this image achieves.",
