      "question": "Is the edited image a two-panel comic strip with the title “Cake Conundrum!” displayed at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image is divided into four panels, and it appears to include illustrations with speech bubbles depicting a narrative involving a cake character. There is no evidence of a title 'Cake Conundrum!' displayed above the comic. Often in comic strips, titles or headers are presented at the beginning, but based solely on the visual cues, none is visible here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cake have expressive eyes added to its surface, positioned where the face would be, and is there a strawberry placed on top resembling a hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cake character is illustrated, notably with large, expressive eyes on its surface, indicative of a facial expression. A strawberry is placed atop the character, likely meant to mimic a hat or adornment. Such creative enhancements in edited images are common to anthropomorphize objects for storytelling or humor purposes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "In the first panel, are the cake creature’s eyes wide open, showing surprise, and is the dialogue “Who ate my delicious corner?!” present in a speech bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, the cake creature's eyes are wide open, typically signaling surprise or shock. This is a common visual cue used in illustrations to suggest an emotional reaction. However, the dialogue in the panel reads 'Who ged lueks doonundndrurm!!' rather than 'Who ate my delicious corner?!' suggesting a different narrative or intentionally altered text.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In Panel 1, are there faint silhouettes of utensils (such as spoons or forks) visible in the background, suggesting a party setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the background of the first panel in Image B, there are no faint silhouettes of utensils indicative of a party or dining setting. Such visuals, if present, usually play a role in setting context or scene elements in narrative illustrations, but they are not visible here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "In Panel 2, does the cake creature appear to be shaking its head, has the dialogue “No more free bites, time for dessert defense!” been added, and are strawberries and garnishes arranged as bodyguards and a shield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second panel of Image B, the cake character appears to be exhibiting a gesture that might suggest head movement, such as shaking. The text in the dialogue bubble does not match 'No more free bites, time for dessert defense!' but instead contains altered or nonsensical text. Additionally, while there are strawberries near the cake character, they don't explicitly come across as bodyguards or a shield. Such arrangements often require clear visual cues to support that interpretation.",
