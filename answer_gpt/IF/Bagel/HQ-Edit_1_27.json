      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible decorative glass dome that surrounds the entire diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can clearly see that the entire scene, including the miniature Eiffel Tower, trees, and figures, is enclosed within a glass dome. This dome has a base and a top knob, typical of cloche-style decorative domes often used to encase delicate displays or miniature scenes. This visual cue, combined with the knowledge of how such domes are used decoratively, supports the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the snow in the scene have a delicate, powdery texture, appearing soft and lightly settled rather than dense or icy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow in Image B appears finely textured and evenly distributed across the base of the dome and on the branches of the trees, which visually suggests a soft, powdery quality. This assessment is based on the visual softness and lightness seen in the distribution and appearance of the snow, typically associated with powdery snow conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures in the scene noticeably smaller in scale and dressed in vintage-style clothing consistent with early 20th-century Parisian fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B are small in scale, consistent with the miniaturized environment of the dome, and they appear to be dressed in clothing styles that are typical of early 20th-century fashion. This includes long coats, hats, and other attire that aligns with historical dress codes of that era, inferred from the visual design style that gives an old-world feel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the streetlamps in the scene significantly smaller than normal scale and do they emit a soft, subtle glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlamps are miniaturized, consistent with the scale of the other elements within the dome. They emit a soft, warm glow, contributing to the cozy and romantic atmosphere typical of such dioramas and indicating a reduced scale with decorative lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, leafless trees in the scene with only a light dusting of snow on their branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features miniaturized trees that are leafless, which aligns with the typical look of winter trees. The branches are lightly dusted with snow, indicating a gentle, freshly fallen snow appearance, which enhances the delicate beauty of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible cobblestone pathways, partially exposed and winding through the snow-covered ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cobblestone pathway that is partially visible amidst the snow, winding through the miniaturized scene. This feature is indicated by a textured path leading toward the Eiffel Tower, suggesting a quaint Parisian street scene consistent with snowy conditions where cobblestones would be only partly covered by snow.",
