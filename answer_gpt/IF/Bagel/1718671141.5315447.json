      "question": "Does the building now feature visible brass gears integrated into its exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building displays several large brass gears integrated into its exterior, which stands out with their metallic sheen. This contrasts with Image A, where the building's exterior features smooth glass and modern lines without any gears. The presence of the gears in Image B gives the structure a steampunk aesthetic that is not present in the typical architectural style of the original.",

      "question": "Are there copper-colored funnel-shaped structures present on the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several copper-colored funnel-shaped structures that are part of the building's exterior. This is in stark contrast to Image A, where the building is free from such structures and follows a more contemporary design devoid of such industrial elements. These funnels contribute to the image's overall steampunk style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the original glass dome been replaced with a dome featuring intricate metalwork patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original glass dome does not appear to be replaced; instead, it is integrated into a larger complex structure that includes many gears and industrial elements. The dome itself, however, does not feature intricate metalwork patterns and is not the central focus of the new design. Therefore, the choice in the question indicates this feature has not been replaced in the expected manner.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the moon in the sky replaced by one or more giant clock faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the moon replaced by clock faces. Instead, the large clocks and other elements are integrated directly into the building's facade. The sky itself has no clock faces replacing the celestial bodies visible in Image A. Therefore, the clock faces are associated with the building, not the sky.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are rivets visibly present on the clock faces and/or the building's exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rivets are visibly present on both the large clock faces and the building's exterior, contributing to the steampunk aesthetic. These details are consistent with the industrial design elements portrayed in the edited image, contrasting with Image A's smooth, rivet-free surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there visible steam or vapor emitting from parts of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clouds of steam or vapor visibly emitting from various parts of the building, including some funnel-shaped structures. This detail enhances the steampunk style, indicating processes or machinery operating within the structure. Such steam emissions are absent in Image A, which suggests a more passive and modern structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the transformed building clearly visible in the water below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection of the transformed building in Image B is not clearly visible in the water below. The second image conceals any such reflection due to the altered design focus and presentation, which differs from Image A, where the original structure's reflection is an integral visual element.",
