    "Question": "Q2: Are the cliff faces covered with crystalline textures that resemble sharp, purple-hued amethyst shards?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings of the creature include textures that are highly crystalline and purple, which bear a resemblance to sharp amethyst shards.

    "Question": "Q3: Are there glowing blue (azure) patterns visible on the cliff faces that resemble ancient magical symbols or designs?",
