        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island is distinctly depicted as floating in the sky above pastel-colored clouds, entirely suspended and disconnected from any land or water surface, suggesting a fantastical scenery compared to Image A, where the village is situated on land surrounded by water.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment does not include a lake or water reflections as seen in Image A. Image B depicts a floating island in the sky with clouds below and no body of water present, making the reflection question inapplicable in this scenario.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
