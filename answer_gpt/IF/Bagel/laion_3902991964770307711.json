      "question": "Are the three top portions of the candelabra replaced with transparent, tapered glass perfume caps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts a single perfume bottle with a cap, and there is no sign of three separate top portions. The bottle cap is not transparent, nor is it tapered like a glass perfume cap. There is an absence of any segments resembling a candelabra. Based on this observation and world knowledge of objects like perfume bottles, the top portion does not resemble glass caps. Hence, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Have the curved arms connecting the top portions been replaced with sleek, seamless gold-finish tubing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, no curved arms are present. The perfume bottle does not exhibit any characteristics resembling those of a candelabra, such as curved connecting arms. The absence of these features means the question on replacing them with gold-finish tubing does not apply. Thus, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Is there a minimalist brand logo embossed on the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a perfume bottle standing upright with no visible logo or embossing at its base. Perfume bottles typically show branding or logos on the label or packaging surface. The lack of an embossed logo at the base means the answer is no.",

      "question": "Are intricate floral-engraved patterns visible across the surface of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a perfume bottle with floral designs printed on its label, not the surface of the bottle itself. The engraving would imply three-dimensional patterns on the material of the object, which is not visible in this case. The floral design appears as part of the label, not an engraving on the surface. Therefore, the answer is no.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a perfume bottle with an elegant script font printed on its label running vertically along the bottle. The label is positioned at the front, almost central on the bottle, typically where labels are placed. Therefore, based on world knowledge about label placement on perfume bottles and considering where script font is present, the answer is yes.",
