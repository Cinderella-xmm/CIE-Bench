        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the musician's attire is not indicative of a famous 1920s jazz artist. He is depicted wearing a casual modern jacket rather than a vintage style typical of the era. Additionally, there is no evidence of iconic jewelry or clothing accessories linked with famous jazz artists of the time, such as sharp suits or distinctive musical elements. The atmosphere, while dimly lit, lacks any other direct indications of a 1920s jazz scene or celebrity status.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background does not suggest the lively environment of a speakeasy. It lacks essential elements such as crowded bar scenes or clandestine gatherings typical of speakeasies. Instead, it features stylized art deco design elements with cutouts of figures, focusing more on graphic representations than an authentic scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
