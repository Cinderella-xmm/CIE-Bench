      "question": "Does the edited image depict the camera with intricate gears and mechanical components characteristic of steampunk design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is stylized with artistic elements that evoke a steampunk aesthetic, including complex mechanical detailing and structural embellishments around the camera body. These visual cues are typical of steampunk design, which often features machinery and engineering motifs reminiscent of the Victorian era. The presence of these details suggests that the camera is rendered with such a design in mind.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the camera and tripod in the edited image rendered with a metallic finish resembling brass, iron, or similar materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a stylized depiction where both the camera and tripod appear to have a polished, metallic-like finish. The coloring and textural cues give the impression of materials such as brass or iron, often used to enhance the aesthetic in steampunk representations. This metallic rendering contrasts with a more traditional appearance, implying a deliberate choice to emulate metallic surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image include visible rivets, bolts, or pipe-like structures as part of the camera and tripod design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, one can observe artistic additions typical to steampunk elements, such as visible constructs resembling rivets and potential pipe-like designs integrated into the camera and tripod. These components are not part of a typical camera design but are characteristic features of a steampunk motif, which often includes exaggerated mechanical detailing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image emphasize the metallic textures through strong contrasts and reflections, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lighting has been used effectively to highlight and create a sense of depth and dimension, particularly on the surfaces that appear metallic. This is achieved through strong contrast in color and what appears to be reflective highlights, which are designed to accentuate the metallic finish and give a more robust three-dimensional look.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate signs of aging or weathering, such as rust or scratches, on the metallic surfaces of the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, despite the stylization, there appears to be no overt signs of aging like rust or scratches. While the design includes mechanical features, the surfaces seem clean and polished without the typical visual cues of wear and tear. Thus, the image does not incorporate such aging effects.",
