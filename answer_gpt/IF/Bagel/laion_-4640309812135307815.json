    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the dress been transformed into a translucent red-tinted glass flacon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress maintains the appearance of a dress with red petal motifs and does not exhibit characteristics typical of glass such as reflection, transparency, or a flacon-like form. The material still looks like fabric rather than glass, as supported by the analysis according to common dress material knowledge in fashion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are petal motifs embossed across the surface of the flacon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clearly visible petal motifs on the surface of the dress, which appear to be part of the fabric design rather than embossed on a flacon surface. The dress retains its textile appearance with recognizable petal decorations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the bottle have an elegant cap resembling a stylized red flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An elegant cap resembling a stylized flower would suggest a distinct, separate component that caps the top of a bottle. In Image B, there is no visible object or structure on the dress that resembles a capâ€”it remains consistent with a dress design. No such bottle cap feature is indicated on the dress.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a metallic label with a cursive brand signature on the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a noticeable addition is a small rectangular object resembling a label held in the model's hand, containing cursive writing, which gives the appearance of a label with a cursive brand signature. This is a reasonable deduction when comparing the presence of the object and the common characteristics of brand labeling in perfumes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bottle maintain a sleek, elongated shape that mirrors the silhouette of the original dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show a dress with a sleek, elongated silhouette. While the concept of a bottle having this shape is imaginary, the existing analysis of the dress's form in Image B maintains that sleek and elongated appearance, consistent with the imagery of a bottle but recognized as a dress from a visual analysis perspective.",
