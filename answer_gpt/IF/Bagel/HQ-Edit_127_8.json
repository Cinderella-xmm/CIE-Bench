      "question": "Is the entire castle scene enclosed within a transparent glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle scene, including the knight and the gate, is clearly encapsulated within a transparent glass orb. This is evidenced by the spherical shape that encloses the entire scene and the base on which it is mounted, typical of snow globe-like structures. This structure is absent in Image A where the castle scene is part of an open landscape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stone textures on the castle walls visibly smaller and more detailed, consistent with a minified appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone textures are smaller and appear to be more intricate, adapting to the scale of a miniature model typically found within a snow globe. This contrasts Image A, where the stones are part of a life-sized castle structure, appearing larger due to the natural scale of the depicted scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knightâ€™s armor and the gate structure rendered in an antique bronze color with visible aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the knight's armor and the gate structure in a consistent antique bronze hue, suggesting a patina effect, often used to give objects an aged appearance. World knowledge about miniature figures often includes such color schemes to enhance aesthetic and perceived value. In comparison, Image A depicts the knight's armor as metallic with a realistic sheen, and the gates in more natural wooden tones without the aged bronze effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, fluttering heraldic flags visible on the battlements of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small flag held by a figurine on the battlements. This is a common addition in miniature sets to add detail and character. The flag is present in Image A as well, but since it is a life-size representation, it appears as a larger, more prominent feature, fitting the context of an actual castle setting.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small turrets and crenellated walls arranged in a circular pattern around the base of the glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any turrets or crenellated walls arranged in a circular pattern around the base of the glass orb. The focus is primarily on the central castle scene contained within the orb. This feature is absent in both images, indicating a different style of mounting or design element than what the question suggests.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are golden light rays visibly sculpted into the glass of the orb, emanating from behind the castle to simulate a rising sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden light rays in Image B are depicted as emanating from behind the castle scene within the glass orb, giving the appearance of a radiant sunburst effect. This sculpture of light rays is typical of artistic renderings within snow globes to enhance the visual dynamics of the scene. In Image A, the background uses natural sunlight to create the effect of a sunrise.",
