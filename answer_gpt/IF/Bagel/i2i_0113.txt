    "Question": "Q3: Are weapons included as interchangeable accessories?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with a small, simplistic firearm held in its hand, characteristic of soft vinyl figure accessories that could be interchangeable. However, without direct visual evidence of additional accessories or known interchangeable parts, there's insufficient information to conclude definitively whether the weapon is interchangeable. Without more detail indicating multiple accessories, the most reasonable judgment is that the weapon is part of the figure's fixed design, not interchangeable.",
