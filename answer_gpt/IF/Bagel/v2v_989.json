      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is illustrated in a simplified and stylized manner, with features that are characteristic of the 'chibi' style, such as rounded shapes, simplified lines, and an overall cute appearance. This style often involves exaggeration of certain features to enhance cuteness. The dog's face and body are rendered with minimal details, which aligns with the chibi aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag are drawn with clean lines and solid fills of color, lacking any gradients or shading that could give a 3D appearance. This design choice indicates a minimalist and flat design style, characterized by simplicity and avoidance of complicated textures or dimensions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog is one of the main elements, but it does not stand out as the most prominent feature. It blends with the overall design of the illustration, which includes the bench and other objects, rather than highlighting the dog's distinct characteristics. The simplification of features reduces its prominence compared to a more detailed depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the illustration incorporate a bold white outline around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bold white outline surrounding the entire illustration, which is clearly visible against the neutral background. This outline accentuates the various elements and provides a sticker-like appearance, typical of designs meant to stand out as individual pieces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog and bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame of the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no circular frame apparent; instead, the illustration is framed with a white outline that follows the contour of the objects. There is no overlapping or extension beyond a circular boundary as no such boundary exists in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the illustration transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a neutral, likely beige background surrounding the illustration, suggesting that the background is not transparent. Transparent backgrounds are typically indicated by a lack of color or any visible surface behind the main elements, which is not the case here.",
