    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image have a horizontal 3:2 aspect ratio?",
    "explanation": "Image B appears to have a more square-like orientation rather than the elongated appearance characteristic of a 3:2 ratio. A 3:2 aspect ratio is commonly more rectangular, typically found in traditional photographic dimensions. The balance and proportion in Image B do not match this ratio, suggesting it is closer to a 1:1 aspect ratio.",
