    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image show a left-side 90-degree view of the sofa alongside the front view?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the edited image displays only the front view of the sofa positioned beneath the artwork on the wall. There are no visual indications of a side view, let alone a 90-degree angle view of the sofa. This observation is based on the straightforward frontal presentation of the sofa and its alignment directly underneath the painting, showing no angled transition.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the dimensions of the sofa consistent between the front and left-side views?",
    "explanation": "Since Image B exclusively shows the front view of the sofa without a left-side view, it is impossible to compare dimensions between two views that aren't present together. The sofa's dimensions appear consistent within this singular perspective.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition between the front and side views of the sofa smooth and coherent?",
    "explanation": "Given that the edited image features solely the front view, there is no transition depicted between front and side views of the sofa. Thus, the question of smooth and coherent transition doesn't arise with the lack of a visible side angle.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the lighting and shadows on the sofa consistent in both the front and side views?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image B, lighting sources are from the left-hand side, casting shadows prominently on the right side of the sofa. No side view is shown to assess the consistency across different angles. With the single front view presented, the lighting and shadows are consistent, but there's no basis for comparison between views.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do objects around the sofa (e.g., wall art) appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the combined view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall art is directly aligned above the sofa, and its dimensions seem appropriately scaled in relation to the sofa's size and the room's layout. With only the frontal view provided, the positioning appears reasonable, maintaining proper scaling visually according to common decorating conventions without any apparent distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
