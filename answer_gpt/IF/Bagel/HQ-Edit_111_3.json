      "question": "Is the image formatted as an educational infographic with structured layout elements such as titles, labels, and text boxes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents elements that are common in educational infographics, such as a structured layout including a prominent title, labels with arrows pointing to different parts of the butterfly, and extra text explanations. These characteristics indicate an intention to educate about the butterfly's anatomy, which is typical of infographics.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase 'Butterfly Biology Basics' is positioned at the top center, which is a common location for titles in educational materials as it is one of the first places a viewer will look.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax) labeled with monochrome line-drawing overlays on the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows labels with arrows pointing to the butterfly's different anatomical parts, overlaying the image of the butterfly. This suggests a monochrome line drawing that marks specific areas for educational purposes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are pink flower petals included in the image to represent the butterfly’s feeding preference?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) includes an illustration of a pink flower alongside the butterfly, which could represent the butterfly's association with feeding, as butterflies are often depicted near flowers due to their role in pollination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are text elements present under the title and near the flower, though they seem incoherent. While they are part of the infographic setup, they do not clearly indicate or explain the butterfly's role in pollination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall visual style delicate, with the butterfly’s vibrant blue color clearly emphasized as the central focal point?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) emphasizes the butterfly by using a vibrant blue color against a relatively simple and uncluttered background, which highlights its central importance in the composition. However, the presence of educational overlays might diminish the visual style's delicacy compared to purely aesthetic imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
