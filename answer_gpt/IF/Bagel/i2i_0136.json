      "question": "Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a small, spherical item that visually resembles a stylized version of an orange. It has decorative grooves and patterns that are typically associated with toy or novelty items rather than the organic texture of a real fruit. Moreover, the presence of a keyring further suggests it is a keychain. Thus, visual cues combined with world knowledge about common designs for novelty keychains lead to the conclusion that the object is indeed a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit.",

      "question": "Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a small green protrusion on top, which emulates the look of a stem. Despite being made of plastic, the design intentionally mimics the feature of a natural orange's stem. This indicates an effort to retain the stylistic element of an orange stem, though it is not the actual organic stem. When compared to Image A, where a real stem is present, Image B successfully imitates this characteristic.",

      "question": "Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the texture of the orange is glossy and natural, reflecting light in a way that's typical for citrus fruits. In contrast, Image B lacks a genuine glossy sheen that would mimic the natural texture of a fresh orange. The keychain appears to be made of a matte or semi-matte plastic material, which doesn't reflect light to the same degree. Therefore, its texture is notably different from the glossy sheen of the original orange.",

      "question": "Is the keychain visually recognizable as a citrus fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, although a stylized representation, includes features such as a spherical shape, a color resembling that of citrus fruits, and a green protrusion suggesting a stem. These are typical features used to symbolize oranges or other citrus fruits in a stylized manner. Despite being a keychain, these visual cues make it recognizable as a representation of a citrus fruit.",

      "question": "Does the keychain include a visible attachment point like a ring or clip for keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a metallic ring is clearly visible attached to the object, which is a typical design feature for keychains, allowing them to be attached to keys. This ring serves as an attachment point, confirming the object's functionality as a keychain.",
