      "question": "Has the snowboarder's helmet been enlarged proportionally compared to their head and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's helmet appears to fit proportionally with the character's head and body design, considering the chibi art style. The helmet is part of the cartoony aesthetic, where features are often exaggerated but fit within the overall design proportions. Comparing to realistic proportions, such as in Image A, the helmet does not appear overly large for the illustration style.",

      "question": "Have the snowboarder's hands been visibly enlarged compared to their arms and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's hands are portrayed in a chibi or cartoon style, where features like hands are often exaggerated. However, within the context of the stylized art, they appear proportionate to the rest of the body and fit the art style's exaggerated aesthetic. Thus, they are not visibly enlarged in a way that seems disproportionate to the art style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red elements of the snowboarderâ€™s outfit vivid and highly saturated, contrasting sharply with the deep blue tones of the snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's outfit indeed displays vivid and highly saturated reds which stand out against the cooler blue tones of the snowy environment. This color contrast creates a sharp visual distinction, consistent with vibrant and eye-catching designs often seen in illustrations and cartoons.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the snowdrifts and pine trees exhibit a paper-cut style with clean, angular edges and layered textures resembling cut paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowdrifts and pine trees demonstrate a simplified, stylized depiction with clean lines and a flat illustrative style. This can give the effect of a paper-cut appearance, which is characterized by layered textures and fine lines, and it is more simplified and angular than realistic renderings.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are multiple snowboarding poses or trick variations visible or indicated in the image as interchangeable action presets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon image depicts a single static snowboarding pose. There are no visible indicators of different poses or tricks, nor are there additional action presets depicted or implied. The image focuses solely on one illustration of a snowboarder.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a matte-finish collector's album layout that includes bold typography and winter sports-related decorative motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image has a border and includes bold typography with the letters 'CIF' and 'MLLJX,' and has an overall design that suggests a collector's card or badge. However, there is no clear signifier of a matte-finish, and the decorative motifs do not strongly indicate a winter sports theme beyond the immediate snowboarding illustration.",
