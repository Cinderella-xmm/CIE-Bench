        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures appear to have a smooth and glossy surface, which reflects light in a manner typical of fine porcelain or similar polished materials.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom front of the grotto does feature a branding plate that suggests elegance. However, there is no visible indication of velvet lining as the scene is open and not shown inside a box. Given the information that is visible, it's reasonable to infer the elegant branding but incorrect to assume velvet lining or box presence.",
