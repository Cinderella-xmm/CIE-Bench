      "question": "Has a person been added to the image near the zebra's tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a person visible in the foreground. They are positioned in the area where the zebra is located, but they are not specifically near the zebra's tail. The person is closer to the zebra's torso and head, rather than the tail region.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the zebra have its head partially turned toward the person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra appears to be keeping its head in a downward position towards the water, similar to its posture in Image A, and is not turned towards the person added to the image. Therefore, it is deduced that the zebra's head is not turned toward the person.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the person's foot positioned near or on the zebra's tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon assessing Image B, the person's foot is positioned away from the zebra's tail, specifically closer to the zebra's front leg region, and does not appear to be near or on the zebra's tail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements such as the watering hole, rocks, and background environment seem unchanged from Image A apart from the addition of the person. This indicates that the original environment has been preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the zebra's expression and posture indicate it is startled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra maintains a posture similar to that in Image A, with its head down. There are no visible signs such as muscle tension or alert posture like erect ears that would typically indicate it is startled.",
