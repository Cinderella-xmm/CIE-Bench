      "question": "Has the cactus been transformed into a surreal, non-naturalistic creature with a distinct sentient appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a creature with multiple legs, large colorful eyes, and a crystal-like spine. These elements give it a surreal and non-naturalistic appearance, distinct from a typical cactus. Unlike natural cacti, which are plants with rigid, spiny arms, this creature has a more organic, alien-like form suggesting sentience due to its eyes and limbs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cactus arms now appear as segmented, flexible appendages terminating in glowing orbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B features segmented appendages that resemble flexible arms commonly seen in fictional or surreal illustrations of alien creatures. These appendages terminate in glowing orbs, which are visually distinctive and unlike the rigid and spiny arms of a real cactus, suggesting a transformation from the natural appearance of a cactus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the surface of the cactus fully covered with iridescent scales that display a blend of desert-colored hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature's surface in Image B appears to be textured, giving an iridescent quality due to the vivid, colorful appearance. However, it does not fully emulate the appearance of desert-colored hues or scales typical of a natural cactus surface, which is usually more muted and uniform.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the central column of the cactus been replaced with a tall, faceted, crystal-like spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the creature from Image B, there is a tall, pointed structure that resembles a faceted crystal emerging from its center, replacing what would naturally be the central column of a cactus. This feature is distinctly different from a natural cactus structure and adds to the surrealistic transformation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there thorn-like, glowing tendrils present that follow the shape and contours of the cactus structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's creature features prickly, thorn-like structures along its limbs but they do not glow or produce tendrils that follow the traditional shape of a cactus. While there is a glowing element to part of its anatomy, these features do not exhibit the nature of following or outlining the former cactus structure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the surreal creature firmly anchored in sandy terrain, casting a realistic shadow, and positioned upright like a vigilant sentinel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is positioned on a sandy surface with an upright stance. Its shadow is visible and cast realistically on the ground, reminiscent of a sentinel standing watchfully. This anchoring in the terrain is similar to how a cactus might stand, although the creature's form is far more fantastical.",
