      "question": "Is the sandwich depicted in a thick-painted cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandwich in Image B has bold outlines and flat areas of color, typical of a cartoon illustration style. The details are not photo-realistic; instead, they are exaggerated or simplified, which is characteristic of thick-painted cartoon imagery.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich cross-section clearly emphasized with distinct textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich layers are outlined and colored but lack intricate textures. The emphasis is more on the differentiation between sections using color rather than detailed textures. Compared to Image A, where textures are more naturally depicted, Image B simplifies these into less distinct areas.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the lettuce been simplified into smeared green shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce is represented by simple green shapes without detailed texture or variation, appearing almost abstract. This contrasts with Image A, where the lettuce shows more realistic detail and variety. The simplification in Image B resembles smeared shapes rather than detailed depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there sauce decorations added around the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows green shapes around the plate that appear to be artistic or decorative, which could be interpreted as sauce decorations. These are absent in Image A, suggesting they have been added in the edit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the final image style fit a modern Western restaurant menu visual aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Modern Western restaurant menus often use high-quality, realistic images to entice customers. Image B's cartoon style, with its simplified and bold depiction, does not align with the typical photo-realistic aesthetics expected on such menus. Instead, it more closely resembles illustrative art.",
