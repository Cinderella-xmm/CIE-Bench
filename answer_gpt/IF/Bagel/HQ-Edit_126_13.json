    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a diagram composed of annotated lines and minimalist icons surrounding the tea set, illustrating the four steps of \"The Journey of Tea\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a diagram with lines and simplified icons around the tea set, illustrating some steps like harvested leaves and sipping tea related to 'The Journey of Tea.' The presence of arrows and text labels also suggest a procedural illustration concerning tea preparation or consumption.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there four distinct minimalist icons visible in the image, each corresponding to one of the following: tea leaves harvested, boiling water poured, sipping for mindfulness, and blossoms symbolizing tranquility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only two minimalist icons are visible that can be assumed to denote tea-related activities: one might symbolize leaves or a cup for tea and the other depicting sipping. However, there are no distinct icons representing all four mentioned activities. This is concluded by analyzing available icons and their assumed representations based on visual simplicity and the theme.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the labels or captions accompanying the diagram written in a handwritten calligraphy style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textual elements in Image B have a handwritten quality which can be perceived as a calligraphy-like style with its flowing, cursive appearance, typical of handwritten fonts making them visually distinct.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are soft pastel green hues present in the diagram elements (e.g., lines, icons, or text) to complement the overall color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The diagram in Image B uses a soft pastel green for the lines and circles, which resources around the tea set indicating the steps. This aligns with the overall muted color scheme in the image, providing subtle contrast while maintaining harmony.",

      "question": "Are all original objects—the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with cherry blossoms, and patterned mats—present and unchanged in their positions and appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A (original) and Image B (edited), all original objects such as the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with blossoms, and mats seem to be present in their original state without any positional or appearance alterations. The added diagram does not alter or remove these objects.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the added diagram avoid overlapping or obscuring any of the original table elements and instead flow naturally around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diagram is placed around the objects, and it does not interfere or overlap with the original table elements like the teapot, cup, or cherry blossoms. The design flows naturally around these objects, suggesting a deliberate placement that prevents obstruction.",
