      "question": "Are there exactly six chibi-style stickers in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinctly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each positioned apart from one another. Visual cues indicate these are individually drawn entities, not combined into a single sticker. By counting the distinct entities, it is clear there are six chibi-style stickers in total.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi characters in the stickers have oversized, expressive eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style stickers depict characters with significantly larger-than-normal eyes, a characteristic commonly associated with chibi art. The expressions are exaggerated, which is typical for chibi styles, particularly through the eyes. This visual cue aligns with the description of 'oversized, expressive eyes.'",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background of the stickers feature warm, earthy tones along with subtle stars or confetti?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the background behind the stickers primarily features a soft pink color. Scattered among the stickers, there are small graphical elements like stars which resemble confetti, effectively giving the appearance of decoration or embellishment. However, the main background tone does not strongly resemble typical 'warm, earthy tones,' like browns or beiges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the aspect ratio of the edited image 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, it appears more square in shape rather than a rectangle typical of a 9:16 aspect ratio, which is often taller. This conclusion is drawn from the symmetrical, balanced distribution of elements in both horizontal and vertical directions, indicating a more equal-sided shape.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the riderâ€™s shirt depicted in a chibi style and retains the beige color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi depiction of the person riding the horse with a shirt that appears chibi-styled, much like the rest of the character's features. The color of the shirt is clearly beige, matching the original color seen in traditional styles for continuity in representation.",
