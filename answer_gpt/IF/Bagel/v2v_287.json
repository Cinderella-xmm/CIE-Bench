      "question": "Is the train depicted as a 3D voxel model with a blocky, pixelated appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is characterized by a blocky, simplified appearance reminiscent of voxel art, which resembles 3D pixels. The train has distinct, square-like shapes and edges that are typical of voxel models. This approach often conveys a stylized, minimalistic look, deviating from the smooth and realistic textures of traditional 3D models.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train's 3D voxel model use a similar color palette and design simplicity as the icons shown in the left image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train features a simplified design with distinct block segments and a basic color palette primarily consisting of white, blue, and red. This simplicity can be likened to the design approach seen in icons or minimalist graphics, where emphasis is placed on essential shapes and colors without detailed textures or gradients, similar to simplified icons which use basic colors and shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in high enough detail to suggest an 8k resolution, with no visible pixelation or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a simplified, stylized aesthetic typical of voxel or low-poly art, which deliberately omits fine detail and often resembles lower-resolution graphics. This art style does not prioritize achieving high realism or extreme detail, as seen in high-resolution images like 8k, but rather focuses on a simplified representation with clear blocky features.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train's 3D voxel model exhibit clean, precise shading and lighting effects consistent with those produced by Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shading and lighting serve to enhance the blocky, simplified 3D appearance, but they do not reflect the highly detailed, realistic, and precise quality typically achieved with rendering software like Octane. Octane produces sophisticated lighting and shading effects that emphasize photorealism, whereas the voxel style in Image B maintains a basic and stylized light and shadow effect.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the 3D voxel model of the train retain the original train's proportions and overall shape, making it recognizable despite the stylistic change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylized voxel representation in Image B, the train retains key elements of the original train's outline, such as the iconic streamlined shape and features like the large windows and prominent front, albeit in a more abstract, blocky format. This allows it to be recognizable as a train, maintaining the fundamental proportions and layout seen in Image A, even though specific details are minimized or altered due to the stylistic change.",
