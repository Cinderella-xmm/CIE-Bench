      "question": "Has the spiral staircase been fully replaced by a serpent-shaped form that follows the same helical path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject, which is in a helical shape, has been visually transformed into a serpent. The serpent's body follows the same spiral or helical path that the staircase in the original image would follow, suggesting it is replacing the staircase's shape. Based on these visual cues, the answer can be inferred.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body feature detailed lattice-like scales across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the serpent has a surface with a series of repeated patterns resembling scales that form a lattice-like or grid pattern along its length, commonly seen on the skin of reptiles. These visual patterns enable us to conclude the presence of detailed lattice-like scales on the serpent's body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s body extended downward in a way that visually replicates the step-like descent of the original staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body is depicted as a continuous, coiled form vertically descending from top to bottom, yet it does not exhibit a step-like character similar to stairs. Instead, it presents as a smooth, flowing form rather than discrete levels. Therefore, it doesn't replicate the step-like descent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ornate, filigree-like patterns present on the serpent’s body, matching the style of the original railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent's body in Image B is characterized by scales, but there are no ornate, intricate, or filigree-like patterns on its surface that mirror the original ornate railing design seen in Image A. The visual inspection confirms the absence of these specific decorative details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the banister been replaced with a series of delicate, translucent fins along the serpent’s side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body is smooth and predominantly covered with scales. There is no presence of fins or fin-like structures along the serpent’s sides that would replace the function or aesthetic of a banister.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a serpent’s head positioned at the uppermost point of the spiral, featuring two distinct luminescent gem-like eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the spiral in Image B is crowned with a distinctly formed serpent's head featuring two striking, luminescent eyes, resembling gems in their brightness and clarity. These attributes clearly confirm the presence of a serpent’s head with gem-like eyes at the highest point of the spiral.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body display a marble-like texture with visible veining and polished surface characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the serpent's body in Image B exhibits a polished look with a pattern reminiscent of marble veining throughout, contributing to a marble-like texture. This observation is based on the smooth, reflective quality and the veining visible on the snake's scales.",
