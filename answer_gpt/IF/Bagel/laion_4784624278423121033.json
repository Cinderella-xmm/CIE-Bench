      "question": "Has the circular dough been replaced with a realistic atom illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main focus is on colorful illustrations representing atomic structures, with elements like colorful loops and spheres that symbolize atoms. The central area of the illustration contains a stylized depiction of a molecule, instead of the circular dough seen in Image A. Image A displays a simple circular dough with a cutter impression, without any detailed or colorful atom illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple atom-shaped cookie designs centered in the image, each in a different color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features colorful atom-themed illustrations, with each having a different design and color scheme, which are centered in the layout. These designs depict atoms with various color loops and spheres. Image A, however, includes only a neutral-toned cookie design with no colorful variations. Therefore, the edited image does have multiple designs with distinct colors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there arrows pointing to and labeling electrons, protons, and neutrons on the atom illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are arrows and labels such as 'Sweakiiies-' and 'Isnect', which visually link different parts of the atomic illustrations. However, these arrows do not explicitly label electrons, protons, and neutrons, as one would expect in an educational scientific illustration. The text appears more playful rather than technical. Therefore, while there are arrows, they do not serve the purpose of identifying these atomic particles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text in the image displayed using a playful, whimsical font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B uses a colorful, decorative style that incorporates multi-colored letters and curved, irregular shapes, consistent with a playful and whimsical aesthetic. It contrasts with traditional and formal typographic designs. From the visual style, we can conclude that the font is indeed playful and whimsical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the illustrations separated by dotted lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, we see a border composed of dotted lines, which segments different sections of the illustration. This separation method is explicitly visible around the main illustrations, clearly delineating the different parts of the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the color scheme of the image harmonize with the natural tones of the dough and cutter (beige, brown, white)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme includes bright and vivid colors associated with the atom illustrations, which involve shades not primarily found in the natural tones of dough and cutter from Image A. The vibrant blues, reds, greens, and oranges do not harmonize with the subdued beige, brown, and white hues of the natural materials seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the text 'Atoms & Cookoies: A Sweet Chestects' at the top in a stylized font. The words intended to resemble 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry,' contain spelling errors and are creatively altered. However, due to the misspellings and changes, the exact title 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry' is not clearly displayed.",
