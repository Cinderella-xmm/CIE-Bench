    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image rendered in a stylized, graphic manner consistent with Art Deco design principles, rather than a photorealistic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach scene is depicted using bold geometric shapes, reduced detail, and strong lines, typical of Art Deco and graphic design. This style is more representational and abstract, moving away from photorealistic depiction which would include fine detail, varied textures, and gradual shading. Based on these visual cues and the stylized approach, this representation matches the Art Deco style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ocean waves represented using bold, simplified geometric curves instead of naturalistic wave forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are depicted with bold, flowing lines and simplified curves that highlight movement without embracing natural form details. Such geometric interpretation is typical in graphic and stylized art, focusing on shape and direction, different from naturalistic waves that would feature irregular patterns and detailed foam. This abstraction of wave forms indicates a move towards bold, simplified curves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted as stylized vertical lines without detailed fronds or natural tree structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, palm trees are represented as vertical lines with minimal detail, stripped down to their essential silhouette. This stylization reduces the complexity of the fronds and trunk to simple, consistent lines, aligning with a graphic design aesthetic rather than the detailed, textured depiction found in realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky rendered as symmetrical, geometric shapes rather than natural cloud forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, clouds are transformed into abstract shapes with a focus on symmetry and geometric design, forgoing the irregular and fluffy appearance typical of real clouds. This involves using repeated patterns and clean lines, indicative of stylized graphic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use a color palette dominated by muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, avoiding bright or highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a color palette with muted tones, incorporating earthy greens, soft blues, and warm oranges. These colors are subdued compared to high saturation, creating a calming and cohesive visual effect consistent with Art Deco palettes which often favor subtlety over vibrancy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the essential elements of the beach scene—sand, ocean, horizon, and sky—still present and recognizable despite the stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the heavy stylization and abstraction, Image B maintains the core components of the beach scene. The sand, ocean, horizon line, and sky are all represented, showcasing the integrity of these elements through abstract shapes and lines that maintain their essential recognition.",
