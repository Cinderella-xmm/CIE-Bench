      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the weightlifter's arms significantly larger and more exaggerated in proportion compared to a realistic human figure, consistent with cartoon styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the weightlifter's arms are depicted in a cartoonish style, with exaggerated muscle size and shape, which is characteristic of cartoon representations meant to emphasize strength or power. Such depictions often deviate from realistic human proportions to create a more dramatic effect. Therefore, the arms are indeed significantly larger and exaggerated compared to those of a realistic human figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible gym-themed motifs (such as barbells, dumbbells, muscle symbols, or fitness-related graphics) incorporated into the design of the weightlifterâ€™s clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the shorts of the weightlifter include designs such as a pizza slice and other abstract symbols that don't directly relate to fitness. Though the scene includes gym elements, the clothing itself doesn't have notable gym-themed motifs like barbells or dumbbells within the designs of the clothing.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the mirror display abstract or creative shadow illustrations rather than a realistic depiction of the weightlifter and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a cartoon illustration on a background resembling wood and doesn't explicitly have a mirror with reflections, unlike a typical gym setting depicted in Image A. It opts for a flat, 2D design with abstract representations. There are no mirror reflections shown in this cartoon style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the black weight plates on the barbell been replaced with colorful, stylized icons (e.g., stars, dumbbells, flames, etc.)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barbell has black weight plates similar to traditional dumbbells or gym weights, maintaining a consistent design with a basic, non-colorful look, unlike the colorful, stylized icons described. Therefore, the weights remain traditional in appearance without replacement by colorful, stylized icons.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal strip at the bottom of the image that resembles a calendar layout (with numbers, days, or month labels) and appears detachable (e.g., with perforated edges or a tab)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom, there is a horizontal strip that features numbers corresponding to days, laid out in a grid format. This layout closely resembles a calendar and suggests a possibility for detachment, as calendar pages often have perforated edges or tabs for tearing off.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the image rendered to resemble a wooden panel with visible wood grain texture and natural coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B has a visual appearance resembling a wooden panel with a wood grain texture. The use of a natural wood coloring further supports this resemblance, as wood panels typically have such an appearance, providing a warm and textured backdrop to the cartoon illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the weightlifter maintained the same standing posture and orientation (facing right, barbell held at waist level) as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the weightlifter is depicted standing upright, holding a barbell at waist level. The orientation in Image B of the weightlifter is facing the viewer, unlike Image A where the weightlifter is facing to the right. Thus, the general posture is maintained, but the orientation has changed.",
