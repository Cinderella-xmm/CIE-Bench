        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several sections that can be interpreted as postcards.

Therefore, there are more than three distinct postcards.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a postcard section that has a blue gradient background with floral designs, which significantly emphasizes an outfit or dress featuring elaborate embroidery. This suggests that the blue gradient is used to highlight the embroidered dress design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a section that prominently displays bamboo stalks as a visual element, resembling a stylized or artistic rendering of bamboo. This indicates the presence of a postcard with bamboo patterns serving as the dominant design element.",
