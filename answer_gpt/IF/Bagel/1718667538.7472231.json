      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger figure is presented in a distinctly flat, cut-paper style. This is evident from its well-defined edges and the absence of realistic shading. The visual impression is one of a crafted paper art piece, emphasizing a two-dimensional appearance typical of cut-paper artworks. This observation aligns with the aesthetic of paper art where shadows and depth are minimal or non-existent, focusing on clear outlines and color contrasts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiger's stripes visibly wider and more stylized than natural tiger markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the tiger are noticeably wider and take on a more stylized form compared to the natural, thin, and irregular pattern found on real tigers. The design is consistent with artistic interpretations where natural elements are exaggerated or simplified to enhance visual impact. This style choice often involves bold, clear lines that distinguish the artistic representation from nature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiger's whiskers noticeably longer and thicker than natural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's whiskers are drawn to be long and prominent, significantly thicker than what would be observed in natural tiger anatomy. This is a common feature in stylized artwork where elements are exaggerated for dramatic effect or emphasis on certain characteristics, fitting well within a paper art motif where details are simplified and exaggerated.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kimono appear as if composed of multiple overlapping paper layers with distinct edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B appears to be composed of multiple layers of paper, with each layer clearly defined by distinct edges. This effect is achieved through the art style that simulates the look of cut-out and glued paper layers, a common method in paper crafting that provides a tactile, layered look despite being a flat image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there shiny, metallic gold accents on the cherry blossom patterns of the kimono?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the cherry blossom patterns are prominent on the kimono, there is no evidence of shiny, metallic gold accents. The decorations and the kimono's patterns maintain a consistent paper art style, which typically does not include metallic elements unless specifically part of a mixed media approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible perforations, tabs, or fold lines indicating detachable sections of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cohesive and flat paper style without visible perforations, tabs, or fold lines that would suggest sections can be detached. In paper art, especially in static images presented in two dimensions, such features are typically absent unless the purpose is to indicate interactivity or assembly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible fold lines or structural elements suggesting the image can be physically folded or interacted with?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design is streamlined and complete, with no visible fold lines or structural elements that would indicate the image is meant to be physically folded or interacted with. This aligns with a typical art piece made to resemble paper craft but is not functionally interactive.",
