    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tree appear as a fantastical, sentient entity with an otherworldly presence rather than a natural tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question resembles a surreal, sentient being with intricate details, such as a humanoid form covered in decorative patterns, standing upright with arms akin to wings. This depiction is radically different from the typical appearance of a natural tree, which has a consistent trunk and canopy without humanoid features. Thus, the tree in Image B has been transformed into a fantastical, otherworldly entity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree's leaves replaced with glowing, fern-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B features fern-like structures on top, which appear to be glowing. This differs from the natural red leaves seen in Image A's tree, indicating an intentional alteration to create a more fantastical appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tree’s bark display detailed silver-colored tribal or ornamental patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a humanoid figure with its body covered in intricate, silver-colored tribal or ornamental patterns. These patterns don't reflect the rough, consistent texture of a traditional tree bark found in Image A, highlighting a distinct transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object possesses wing-like, translucent structures that shimmer, resembling a fairy or mythical winged creature rather than a tree canopy like in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B does not have a consistent, solid trunk like that of a traditional tree seen in Image A. Instead, it features twisted strands resembling glass fibers, giving it an ethereal aesthetic.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vine-shaped tendrils emerging from the base of the tree and extending into the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features vine-shaped tendrils glowing at the base, extending downward, a characteristic not present in Image A. These luminous tendrils contribute to the fantastical transformation of the object.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the glowing tendrils visually blend or harmonize with the surrounding field through color, light, or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing tendrils emerging from the fantastical being appear to harmonize with the field through their color and the way light interacts with them, contrasting with the natural, uniform grass in Image A.",
