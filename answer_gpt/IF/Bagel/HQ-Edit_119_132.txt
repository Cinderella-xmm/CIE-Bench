    "Question": "Q1: Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a plush toy. The visual cues like the soft, velvety brown and cream fabric, the sewn-on eyes, and the overall simplistic and symmetrical features indicate that it is a plush representation of a husky, unlike a live animal that would show detailed fur texture, natural eyes, and more complex anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the paws of the plush toy are rounded and oversized, a common characteristic in plush toys to give a cute and cuddly appearance. This differs from the realistic proportions of a live husky's paws seen in Image A, where they are more proportional to the body size.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a plush toy where the entire surface is made of a velvety fabric which is smooth and uniform. This contrasts with the detailed and complex fur texture seen in live animals like the husky in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the plush toy, including the eyes, are stylized and appear to be embroidered or sewn, giving them a simple, cartoon-like appearance. This is distinctly different from the realistic eyes of the live husky in Image A, which show depth and natural reflection.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the plush toy standing on a flat surface that visually resembles a clean wooden shelf, as indicated by its smooth, light-colored texture and straight edges. This contrasts with the snowy ground seen beneath the live husky in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
