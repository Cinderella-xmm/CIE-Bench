      "question": "Has the backpack's fabric been replaced with a visible rugged leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack's surface has a leathery appearance, which is indicated by the smooth, brown color with visible stitching commonly seen in leather goods. This contrasts with Image A, which shows a fabric material commonly used in cloth backpacks. Observing these visual cues, Image B's material resembles rugged leather compared to Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the buckles been updated to feature an antique brass finish instead of the original metallic silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buckles in Image B appear to have a golden tone that aligns with the visual characteristics of antique brass, whereas the buckles in Image A are silver-colored, which matches standard metallic finishes. The color and style of buckles in Image B suggest an antique brass finish compared to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible vintage-style travel patches attached along the side panels of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows various elements like stamps and compasses embedded into the design around the central focus of the backpack flap, giving a vintage travel theme. Image A lacks these additional elements on its side panels, remaining plain. Thus, Image B contains vintage-style patches that are absent in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" clearly visible and overlaid on the front flap of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large, bold text saying 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' is prominently displayed on the backpack flap, creating a clear branding statement. There is no corresponding text on Image A's backpack. Therefore, Image B clearly displays the text 'EXPLORE VINTAGE.'",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a subtle sketch-style compass graphic embossed near the bottom of the backpack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features a compass graphic at the bottom part of the design, consisting of a circular depiction with directional arrows typical of a compass. This feature is not present in Image A's design, which is simpler and devoid of additional graphics. Thus, Image B does include a compass graphic.",
