      "question": "Are the surfaces of the castle composed of visible wooden puzzle pieces with natural oak and mahogany coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle is clearly made up of wooden blocks that resemble puzzle pieces. These blocks exhibit natural wood colors, such as oak and mahogany, which are typically warm, brown tones. This can be concluded from the visible texture and color variations seen in the pieces, typical of natural wood materials.",

      "question": "Does the castle retain its original architectural structure, including two towers, arched entrance, multiple windows, and connecting walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The castle in Image B maintains its structure from Image A, featuring two prominent towers, an arched entrance, several marked window spaces, and connecting walls that form a cohesive castle design. This structural coherence is clear from the visible arrangement of the wooden blocks which emulate the architectural elements present in a castle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers display detailed interlocking puzzle piece patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the towers show clear interlocking patterns that are characteristic of puzzle pieces. These patterns are achieved through the design of the wooden blocks, which have cutouts and notches specifically designed to interlock with adjacent pieces, reflecting the typical appearance of a 3D puzzle.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the castle placed on a smooth, flat wooden tabletop that serves as the new base of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the castle built upon a flat wooden base, which is indicative of a tabletop. This base is smooth and extends across the bottom of the image, serving as the foundation for the wooden puzzle castle, replacing any other prior elements that could have been present.",

      "question": "Are the wooden components of the castle visibly segmented into individual puzzle-like pieces with defined edges and joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The castle in Image B is visibly composed of distinct wooden blocks, each with clear edges and cutouts that suggest puzzle-like segments. These interlocking features indicate the pieces are designed to fit together, representing a puzzle structure with clearly defined joints between individual pieces.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the castle is surrounded by reflective water. However, in Image B, there is no visible water. Instead, the wooden tabletop serves as the base, replacing the natural landscape and water reflection with a more controlled, indoor setting, typical of showcasing a puzzle or model.",
