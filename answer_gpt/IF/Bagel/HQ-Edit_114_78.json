      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly housed within a case that resembles a vintage-style box.

This portrayal emphasizes an imaginative connection, as is common in fantasy dioramas.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a river-like feature is visible, flowing from what is implied as the tip or base of the key. The material used for this river mimics a resin-like quality, with smoothness and reflectivity that are often used to depict water in model displays, creating an illusion of movement and adding to the scene's narrative.",
