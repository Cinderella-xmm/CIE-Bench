      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of ukiyo-e art such as flat color areas, strong outlines, and stylized forms instead of realistic 3D rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by flat color areas, predominantly featuring indigo and gold, and the forms are highly stylized rather than three-dimensional. The strong, smooth outlines delineate various elements, which are typical of ukiyo-e art known for its illustrative quality. The stylization and lack of realistic shading contribute to its two-dimensional look.",

      "question": "Are the robes flattened into a two-dimensional, flowing pattern with visible indigo and gold coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe is shown in a two-dimensional pattern with visible indigo and gold colors. The patterns on the robe flow in an artistic manner that emphasizes decorative elements rather than realistic contours or shadow areas, reflecting the ukiyo-e style that tends to focus on graphic quality and theme.",

      "question": "Are the arms accentuated with dynamic, brushstroke-like calligraphic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are depicted with smooth, flowing lines that resemble dynamic brushstrokes. These lines add a calligraphic quality to the image, emphasizing motion and fluidity, which are common stylistic elements in traditional Japanese art forms like sumi-e rather than ukiyo-e art.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the face depicted with soft, minimalistic, and serene outlines rather than detailed anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the blurred face, the potential style of the face in Image B could be inferred to be minimalistic and serene consistent with the overall ukiyo-e theme. Such art typically employs soft outlines and minimizes detailed anatomical features to convey expression through simplicity instead.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background filled with stylized, wave-like cloud patterns that contribute to an ethereal, decorative atmosphere. These patterns are typical in traditional Japanese art, which often uses nature motifs and exaggerated clouds to create a sense of harmony and aesthetics in line with the ukiyo-e style.",
