      "question": "Is the overall scene rendered in a pop art style with bright, flat colors and comic book-like aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of bright and vivid colors along with flat, graphic representation of elements is evident. The image resembles a comic book aesthetic with clear lines and high contrast, typical of pop art. The scene does not attempt to realistically depict colors and textures, instead opting for simplified and exaggerated hues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train feature bold primary colors (such as red, blue, or yellow) and halftone dot patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is prominently displayed in red, a bold primary color. The surface incorporates halftone dot patterns, which are characteristic of the pop art style and comic book aesthetics. This style resembles typical comic illustrations where shading and textures are often created using dots.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the barnâ€™s wooden texture been replaced with stylized geometric shapes instead of realistic wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the barn with a stylized depiction that lacks realistic wood grain. Instead of showing the natural texture of wood, the barn is rendered with flat colors and simple geometric shapes, deviating from the intricate details of wood, which is consistent with pop art's preference for abstraction and simplification over realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the trees and grass been converted into vibrant, abstract, graphic bursts rather than realistic vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and grass are represented in vibrant colors like pink and green, appearing as abstract shapes rather than realistic foliage. This abstraction aligns with the pop art style, focusing more on the visual impact of color and form rather than a faithful rendition of natural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image (train, barn, tracks, foliage) outlined with sharp, black lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, major elements like the train, barn, and tracks are distinctly outlined with sharp black lines. This is a hallmark of comic book art and pop art, where clear outlines are used to define shapes and create contrast between different areas of color, emphasizing the graphic quality of the image.",
