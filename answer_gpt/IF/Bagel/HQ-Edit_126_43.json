      "question": "Has the antique clock been transformed into a sentient, mechanical creature resembling a steampunk sentinel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mechanical figure with typical steampunk characteristics, such as metallic surfaces, mechanical parts, and intricate designs, combined with limb-like appendages and a central eye. This contrasts Image A, which displays a traditional, ornate antique clock. The transformation is clear from the visual differences, making it appear as a steampunk sentinel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there gear-based limb-like appendages extending from the clock’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a mechanical creature with arms and legs resembling those of a robot, constructed from gears and mechanical parts. Image A depicts a stationary antique clock with no limb-like extensions. The presence of these appendages in Image B suggests a transformation from the original clock structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has one of the clock faces been replaced with a monocled eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of a monocled eye serving as the central feature on the creature's body, where a clock face might typically be. Image A shows traditional clock faces. The eye replacement is evident, symbolizing a transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the pendulum been transformed into a swinging tail-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a mechanical creature with a tail-like appendage featuring a looped end, emulating a pendulum in motion. Image A contains the clock's pendulum, but it is not tail-like. This analogy indicates that the pendulum is reimagined as a tail structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature’s body feature brass and copper-colored metallic surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B reveals the body of the mechanical creature is coated in brass and copper-colored hues, characteristic of steampunk aesthetics, whereas Image A contains a wooden and glass antique clock without such metallic surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there steam valves visibly protruding from the corners or joints of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts various mechanical parts protruding from the creature's body that resemble steam valves, aligning with the steampunk theme. Image A lacks such elements entirely. This comparison confirms the presence of steam valve-like structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate engravings or decorative patterns along the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases fine engravings and detailed patterns along the mechanical surfaces of the creature, indicative of steampunk or elaborate mechanical design. Image A has ornate designs consistent with antique craftsmanship but not on brass or copper surfaces. The presence of such engravings adds detail and character to the creature's body.",
