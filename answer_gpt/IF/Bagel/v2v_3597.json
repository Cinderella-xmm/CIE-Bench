      "question": "Has the contemporary shed been replaced with a vintage wooden washtub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a vintage-style washtub is portrayed, characterized by wood-textured detailing and a manual wringer typical of older laundry methods. This contrasts with a modern shed, which would possess a more contemporary appearance and structure. The visual elements in Image B indicate a focus on historical laundry practices.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surrounding plants and lighting unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are noticeable plants positioned to the left side behind the washtub, which are not present in Image A. The lighting appears consistent in both images, with no substantial deviation in brightness or shadows, suggesting that changes primarily relate to added plants rather than lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the washtub depicted as vintage and made of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the washtub exhibits a vintage design with characteristics typical of wooden structures used historically, such as the round, slatted design inexplicably associated with wood. This style contrasts with more recent materials and designs commonly used in modern laundry equipment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B includes plants above the washtub on the left side, not present in Image A, indicating that new plants have been introduced to the scene, altering the composition of the surroundings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears consistent with Image A, as shadows and highlights fall similarly across both images. This indicates that while the scene elements like plants have changed, the lighting itself remains largely unchanged.",
