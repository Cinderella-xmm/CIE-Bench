      "question": "Does the cat’s head extend slightly beyond the frame edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head does not cross the boundary of the image frame. It is positioned within the constraints of the frame, similarly to common image compositions where subjects are completely captured within the frame edges. This placement ensures that the focus remains on the subject without cropping essential details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curled tongue show clear spatial depth, giving a 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat's tongue curled up in a unique position that could suggest some depth, as it appears to be folded over itself, which can visually imply a three-dimensional shape. The curve and twisting of the tongue provide cues of spatial depth which are consistent with how 3D shapes manifest visually. Although artificially altered, the tongue exhibits these characteristics due to the shadows and highlights present.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the position and angle of the cat’s head create a visual illusion of peeking out from the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head positioning does not suggest an illusion of peeking out of the frame. Most of the head is centrally located and fully visible within the boundaries, resembling a typical portrait placement without suggesting emergent or protruding effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a natural appearance for the cat, aside from the instructed modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's edits, particularly the tongue modification, diverge from a natural look because a cat typically does not have such an exaggerated tongue structure. Despite other aspects like lighting and fur appearing natural, the tongue alteration disrupts the overall natural appearance, deviating from expected biological presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edits seamlessly integrated with the rest of the image, with no noticeable artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, apart from the noticeable tongue modification, the rest of the image seems consistent with the original seamless texture and lighting. The modifications concerning the tongue appear deliberately pronounced, but do not present visible artifacts indicating a poor integration with the original image elements.",
