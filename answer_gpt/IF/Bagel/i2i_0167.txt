    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image include the apple's current front view as originally shown?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, it is divided into four segments: two whole apples and two halves. The whole apple in the top left corner represents its current front view. In Image A, there is an apple set in a front position. Both images feature a similar front view of the apple where the stem is visible. Therefore, Image B includes the apple's current front view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a cross-section view of the apple that shows its inner flesh texture and seeds?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, among the four sections, there are two segments showing sliced apples. These cross-sections reveal the internal texture and seeds of the apple. The visual cues include the apple's flesh color and the placement of the seeds, indicating a detailed cross-section view that shows this information.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image contain a top view that clearly displays the apple's stem structure and calyx area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two whole apples are viewed from different angles, including one in the bottom right corner where the stem is prominently visible. This image segment offers an overhead perspective, showing the apple's stem and the calyx area at its top effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the current front view of the apple remained unchanged compared to the original image?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image A shows the front view of a single apple under soft lighting, emphasizing its smooth texture. Image B displays a similar apple in the top left segment with comparable lighting and compositional elements. Hence, the front view positioning remains unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cross-section of the apple reveal both the flesh texture and seeds accurately?",
    "explanation": "Image B provides a detailed look at the apple's sliced halves where the flesh's texture and the seeds are distinctively visible, displaying the apple's inner details accurately. The sections all show the expected inner attributes of an apple.",
    "answer": "Yes"
