      "question": "Is the character depicted in a cute chibi-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is portrayed with exaggerated features typical of chibi design, such as a larger head and a smaller body, giving it a cute and stylized appearance. The 3D quality suggests depth and dimension, which aligns with a 3D model interpretation. This is a common representation in chibi-style characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chibi character placed in front of the same wall and drainpipe as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a wall and drainpipe setup that closely resembles that in Image A. Despite the stylistic differences, the point where the pipe emerges and the water flow are consistent with those in the original image. This suggests that the chibi character is placed in a similar setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi character hold an oversized and brightly colored umbrella?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the umbrella held by the character maintains a vibrant, multicolored appearance consistent with the one in Image A. The umbrella appears larger in proportion to the chibi character due to the character's smaller, chibi-style size, which is typical in these types of designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there playful raindrops surrounding the chibi character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes visible raindrop elements around the chibi character, which are stylized and exaggerated in size, consistent with a playful design. These droplets appear separate from the water flowing from the drainpipe, suggesting an intentional decorative effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the environment been subtly enhanced to make the rain and reflections appear more vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment appears more stylized, characteristic of 3D modeling with vivid reflective surfaces and rain effects. The reflections and the flow of water are exaggerated, potentially making the scene appear more vivid than a standard photographic depiction.",
