      "question": "Is the entire elephant and savannah scene enclosed within a visible vintage travel case structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the scene with the elephant and a small tree placed within what appears to be a case. The visual structure includes hinges and corners with metallic reinforcements, suggesting a classic or vintage design. This inference is rooted in the appearance of cases commonly used to display miniature models or dioramas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant and landscape elements appear as detailed miniature 3D models with realistic scaling and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the elephant and the surrounding landscape, including a tree and grassy texture, give the impression of being scaled-down, three-dimensional models. The details on the elephant are carefully rendered, and the miniature tree adds to the illusion of depth, a common characteristic in diorama displays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ground covered with a material that resembles grass but has a textured, resin-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground covering has the appearance of grass but, upon closer inspection, may have a uniform and slightly shiny finish suggesting a synthetic material like resin often used in model-making for durability and a clean look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small-scale acacia tree placed in the diorama to indicate scale balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small tree next to the elephant that resembles an acacia, a common tree type in savannah representations. This tree serves as a scale indicator, enhancing the appearance of a miniaturized landscape scene balanced with the size of the elephant model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky depicted as painted elements on the inner surface of a backdrop lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds appear to be part of the background within the case. They seem to be painted or molded onto the inner surface of the lid, giving a stylized and enclosed feeling to the scene as seen in many dioramas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a brass-colored compass placed on the base of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible circular device at the base of the scene which resembles a compass. It appears to be brass-colored, aligning with typical travel themes associated with vintage or exploration-inspired displays.",
