      "question": "Is there a cartoon-style enamel pin representing the hair that features glossy, gold wavy hair with visible pearl embellishments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several enamel pins visible. The one in the upper left corner features glossy, gold wavy hair and a visible pearl embellishment near the ear. This pin's coloring and the pearl detail are consistent with decorative features commonly found in enamel pins. By understanding visual cues like the distinctive gold color, wavy hair shape, and pearl, we can conclude that there indeed is a pin meeting the description.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a cartoon-style enamel pin representing the fur that has a soft pink color and a silky texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the pins feature a texture or color that resembles soft pink fur. While there is a pin with pink hair, it is styled with solid colors typical of enamel work and does not represent fur or a silky texture. Enamel pins usually have a polished, hard surface, not a textured feel akin to fur.",

      "question": "Is there a third cartoon-style enamel pin that features only minimalist outlines, without detailed textures or full coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the enamel pin in the top right corner represents hair and is monochrome with a single color (white) and outlines that are minimalist, and lacks detailed textures or multicolored elements. This style aligns with the description of minimalism where the focus is on simple form over detailed textures.",

      "question": "Do all three enamel pins exhibit a vibrant, polished finish consistent with high-quality enamel pins (e.g., glossy surface, sharp edges, bright colors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All pins in Image B display characteristics of high-quality enamel pins, including vibrant colors, a polished glossy finish, and defined edges. The visual cues such as the shine and the bright color palette suggest a quality consistent with professional enamel pin manufacturing.",

      "question": "Have the original hair and fur been completely replaced by the three distinct cartoon-style enamel pins, with no visible remnants of the original elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the areas occupied by the enamel pins replace the original elements (hair and fur) from Image A with distinct cartoon representations. The pins cover these features fully, and there are no visible remnants or traces of the original hair or fur in Image B. This replacement is complete.",
