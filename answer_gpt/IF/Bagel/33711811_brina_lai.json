      "question": "Are the snowy mountain peaks visibly reshaped into jagged, wing-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains in the background don't have their peaks reshaped into jagged or wing-like structures. The peaks remain consistent with natural mountain formations, not resembling wings or jagged structures typically associated with a mythical creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the foreground lake display a pattern of reflective, scale-like textures across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the lake does appear to have a unique pattern resembling scales. The edited image shows these textures prominently, suggesting a deliberate effect to mimic the scales of a creature, made clear with the surrounding fantastical elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the winding peninsula reshaped into a long, curving, sinewy tail structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peninsula area retains its natural geographical form. It doesn't visually transform into a sinewy tail structure. The peninsula retains a natural, landform appearance without resembling any part of a creature.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant houses reconfigured into a continuous, segmented metallic spine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant houses are still visible as separate structures and aren't reconfigured into a continuous spine-like structure. They maintain their appearance as individual homes, signifying no change to a metallic spine structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are there distinct, swirling cloud formations in the sky that resemble eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no distinct swirling cloud formations in the sky that resemble eyes. The sky appears normal without patterns that suggest eyes or additional fantastical elements beyond what's on the water.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassland area does not exhibit textures resembling fur. The area continues to resemble natural grassland without showing textures indicative of fur on a creature’s body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all modified elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, eyes, fur) integrate seamlessly into a single, coherent mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while certain elements like the scale-like textures on the lake contribute to a fantastical theme, all other described modifications (wings, tail, spine, eyes, fur) are not present. Thus, the elements do not integrate into a single coherent mythical beast as many elements are absent.",
