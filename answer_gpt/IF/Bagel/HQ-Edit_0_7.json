      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene with the parrot and the tiny human figure is clearly placed inside a transparent glass dome, as evidenced by the curved reflective surface and refraction effects depicted at the top of the image. The edges of the dome are visible, indicating it fully encloses the scene, typical of a diorama or display piece. This conclusion is derived from visual indicators such as the curving of light and the circular shape of the dome.",

      "question": "Is the parrot depicted in a chibi style with a large head and simplified body proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parrot is indeed depicted in a chibi style. The head is exaggeratedly large in relation to the body, and the overall form is simplified compared to realistic proportions. Chibi style is characterized by these features, often used to create a cute and whimsical effect. The analysis is based on the difference in proportions compared to typically realistic depictions of parrots.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaves surrounding the parrot significantly larger than normal scale and vibrant in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves that are part of the diorama appear proportionally smaller relative to the chibi-style parrot, and while colorful, they do not appear overly vibrant or larger than normal scale for a miniature scene. This is based on the context that in a diorama, miniature elements maintain a scale consistent with the scene. Thus, by realistic scale considerations of the diorama, the leaves are not unusually large or vivid.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, shiny, crystal-like beads visible on the surface of the leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appear to be crystal-like beads positioned on the surface of the ground within the dome rather than directly on the leaves. These small beads mimic the appearance of dew or decorative elements commonly used in dioramas to add visual interest. Visual cues suggest they are not on the leaves given the positioning shown.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a tiny human figure on a different branch, holding a sketchbook or drawing tool and facing the parrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a tiny human figure can be seen on the ground inside the dome next to the parrot, visually represented holding what seems to be a drawing tool, and facing the parrot. The small scale and detailed props suggest an artistic scene. This visual detail indicates the figure's intent to engage interactively with the parrot, often typical in a diorama storytelling composition.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the base of the glass dome feature a wooden texture with carved or etched tribal patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the glass dome indeed features a wooden texture, marked by its color and grain pattern. Furthermore, it contains carved patterns that could be interpreted as tribal or ornamental etchings, lending a handcrafted or stylized appearance to the display. This conclusion is based on visual indicators such as the texture and patterns apparent in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the diorama include visual elements such as dense foliage, mist, or warm ambient lighting that suggest a rainforest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the greenery and presence of the parrot hint at a natural setting, the diorama itself is enclosed, limiting visual elements like dense foliage, mist, or varied lighting that are typically expansive and found in an actual environment. The simplified and contained scene indicates an indoor or miniature setup rather than a realistic rainforest environment, though it might symbolically represent such a setting.",
