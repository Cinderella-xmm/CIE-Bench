      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow appears to be designed in an exaggerated, cute, and cartoonish style, consistent with the chibi art style. This is characterized by the cow's oversized features, such as its large eyes and a disproportionately large head relative to its body, giving it an adorable and playful appearance. Given these characteristics, the design aligns well with what is commonly recognized as a stylized 3D chibi art style.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is depicted with a stylized fur pattern that features prominent black and white patches, closely resembling the typical coat pattern of a Holstein cow.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is shown with both of its front hooves prominently placed on top of the television, giving the appearance that the cow is leaning against it.
