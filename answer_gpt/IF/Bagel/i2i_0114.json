      "question": "Has the original desk and character structure remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess whether the desk and character structure remains unchanged, we focus on the visual elements like the positioning and appearance of objects and people. In Image B, we observe the same arrangement of characters sitting around the table with consistent clothing and posture as in Image A. This implies that the original setting is preserved except for the additional presence of a modern man.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, a figure dressed in modern formal attire appears on the right side of the composition, suggesting a different attire style that does not belong to the historical context of 'The Last Supper.' This indicates the addition of a modern man to the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the additional figure is seen wearing a black suit, white shirt, and tie, which are characteristic elements of modern formal attire. Thus, the modern man's attire is undoubtedly formal.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the modern man holds a glass in one hand with an elevated arm, suggesting a gesture of raising the glass. This implies that the modern man is indeed raising a glass in the image.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man is situated at the rightmost end of the table, occupying space not originally filled in Image A. This suggests that the modern man is placed at the far right in what was previously unused space in the composition.",
