        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi tech mascot is depicted wearing a rose-colored hoodie, which is similar to the color of the phone case in Image A. This suggests that there might be an intentional incorporation of the phone's color scheme. As for design elements, Image B doesn't show any distinctive features of the phone's design like the camera layout or button placement being part of the mascot's design.",
