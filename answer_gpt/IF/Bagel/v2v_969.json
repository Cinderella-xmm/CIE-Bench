      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a glass sphere resembling a snow globe, placed on a wooden surface that has a rustic appearance.

      "question": "Are the surroundings faded into a vintage baseball clubhouse backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside Image B's snow globe, the background visible through the glass is that of a baseball field, identifiable by the green grass and what appears to be a baseball diamond. The term 'vintage baseball clubhouse' implies a scene with an interior clubhouse feel, which is not visible inside the globe. Instead, the backdrop is clearly an outdoor baseball field rather than any clubhouse setting.",

      "question": "Does soft sunlight filter through the globe, creating warm, golden reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the image has a clear glass sphere, there is no evident indication of light filtering through in a way that creates distinct golden reflections. The lighting appears neutral within the snow globe, and the surroundings do not show specific sunny highlights or golden reflections typical of sunlight filtering.",

      "question": "Are the characters inside the globe depicted as cheerful chibi-style 3D figures in baseball uniforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures inside the snow globe are small and have exaggerated features typical of 'chibi' style, such as larger heads and simpler facial features. They are dressed in baseball uniforms and modeled in a 3D manner. Their stance and attire suggest they are meant to be cheerful, typical of 'chibi' representations.",

      "question": "Does the interior scene include a tiny baseball field with bats propped against the fence and a light layer of snow on the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the snow globe features a miniature representation of a baseball field, evidenced by the green base and baseball diamond setup visible within the globe. While bats are visible with the figures, there aren't any specific signs of bats propped against a fence. There is a layer of faux snow visible around the chibi figures, typical of snow globe decorations, giving the appearance of snow on the grass.",
