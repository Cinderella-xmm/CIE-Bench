      "question": "Is the entire image composed of small, distinct mosaic tiles with visible grout lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the entire image consists of small, rectangular pieces that fit together, and the separation between them is marked by visible lines that resemble grout lines commonly seen in mosaic tile work. This is a characteristic feature of mosaics, which use these lines to separate individual tiles. By observing the pattern and texture, it is clear that the image is crafted to give a mosaic tile appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vivid and saturated, particularly the red heart balloon and the child's features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors appear to be very bright and vibrant. The red used in both the heart balloon and the child's hair is particularly striking, demonstrating a high level of saturation that is common in digital representations of colored tiles. Mosaic works often use bold colors to enhance visibility and impact, which is reflected here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the heart balloon and the child clearly defined and emphasized in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lines outlining the heart balloon and the child are clearly drawn, which is typical of mosaic designs where outlines are emphasized to separate different color sections and enhance detailed elements. The use of black outlines enhances the definition of each element, making it prominent against the vivid background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and all essential elements from the original image been maintained in the mosaic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B to Image A, the mosaic version maintains the key elements of the original composition. The child, the heart balloon, and the positioning are the same in both images, suggesting that the artist has preserved the original composition and its essential components, transforming the style but not the content.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the material of the artwork reflect the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles, such as a glossy or matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's representation suggests a glossy finish, which aligns with the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles. The way light reflects off each colored tile gives the impression of a surface that has a slightly polished or glazed finish, typical in ceramic mosaics. This finish is essential for achieving the visual effects seen in the image.",
