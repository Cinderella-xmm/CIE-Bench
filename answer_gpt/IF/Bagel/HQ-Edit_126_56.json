    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mountains rendered as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces instead of realistic contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are characterized by angular and sharp edges, typical of geometric stylization, rather than the smooth and realistic contours seen in natural scenery. The distinct edges and flat surfaces align with an abstract artistic style rather than a natural representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as geometric forms, such as triangular or stepped shapes, with no realistic leaf details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are represented in a highly stylized manner with triangular and stepped forms, lacking any intricate leaf detailing. This abstract representation is in contrast to naturalistic foliage, emphasizing geometric shapes instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the river composed of a series of radiating parallel lines rather than a continuous, reflective body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The river in Image B does not have the typical wavy, reflective properties of water. Instead, it is composed of straight, parallel lines radiating to suggest a sense of directionality without depicting realistic water reflection, indicating a geometric abstraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all elements in the image outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B are outlined with bold and clear lines, highlighting the abstract and decorative nature of the design. All areas are filled with solid colors lacking gradients or shading, further reinforcing a minimalist and bold aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water in Image B does not feature a symmetrical, geometrically aligned reflection of the surrounding elements. Instead, it is depicted abstractly with angular shapes, deviating from true-to-life symmetrical reflections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible gradients or soft shading in the sky, mountains, or water, or are all areas filled with flat, solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the areas such as the sky, mountains, and water are filled with flat, solid colors without any gradients or soft shading, maintaining a stark and abstract visual style typical of bold, vivid artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image use a vibrant, high-contrast color palette typical of Art Deco design, including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a vibrant and high-contrast color palette with bold hues such as red, gold, blue, and black. This choice of color is reminiscent of Art Deco design, which is known for striking visual contrasts and vivid colors enhancing the overall stylized effect.",
