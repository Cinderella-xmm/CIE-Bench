      "question": "Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the displayed objects are all LEGO brick shapes that visually retain the same marbled pattern seen in Image A, which consisted of spheres and cubes. The transformation from rounded shapes in Image A to the distinct LEGO brick shapes in Image B is evident, with the marbled patterns remaining consistent across both images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the LEGO bricks, it's noticeable that they possess a matte surface without any reflective highlights, unlike Image A where the spheres and cubes appeared to have a glossy finish. This suggests a change in surface texture to a matte appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the LEGO bricks organized in a structured and orderly fashion on a wooden shelf, forming a triangular or pyramid-like pattern. This structured arrangement contrasts with the more dispersed, chaotic arrangement of the spheres and cubes in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks display subtle interlocking details such as studs or recessed connectors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A close inspection of Image B reveals that the LEGO bricks include interlocking details like recessed connectors, which are typical features of LEGO bricks allowing them to connect with one another. This subtle detail confirms that these are indeed LEGO bricks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a clear and uniform surface free of any clutter or additional elements, indicative of a minimalist style. This is a shift from Image A, which had a more complex and busy background setting. The clean backdrop in Image B emphasizes the arrangement of the LEGO bricks, lending a minimalist aesthetic.",
