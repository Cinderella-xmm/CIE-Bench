        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several elements typical of a poster format. There is a prominent title 'MASTER CHEF' at the top, and additional text like 'Finial Round' and 'Final Rounn', indicating an event or competition, which are common in poster designs. The presence of these structured text elements, along with a visually appealing dish image, supports the conclusion that Image B is indeed formatted as a poster.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'MASTER CHEF' is prominently displayed at the top, serving as the focal point for viewers. Its bold and stylized font makes it stand out as the title of the poster, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed the title.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Final Rounn' appears at the bottom portion in red. The subtext 'Finial Round' is also present near the center. However, the exact spelling 'Final Round' does not appear, despite the intended meaning being conveyed. The analysis requires precision in identifying exact text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a plain white plate with a spoon in the center, without any food. On the other hand, Image B features a dish filled with food along with a wooden spoon, not the spoon seen in Image A. Thus, the poster does not include the exact plate and spoon from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bold, attractive fonts and a contrasting color scheme to draw attention. The vivid image of a prepared dish further supports the cooking theme. These elements are in line with thematic design choices typically used to emphasize a cooking competition, thereby suggesting an event like a cooking competition.",
