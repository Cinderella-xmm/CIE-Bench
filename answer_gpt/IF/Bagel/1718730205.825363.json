      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire image, including the cosmic vortex and forest landscape, rendered in the style of a stained glass window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a style characteristic of stained glass with its angular sections and bold outlines, which are typical elements of stained glass design. The presence of outlined segments filled with vibrant colors and the mosaic-like arrangement is indicative of this style. Therefore, the image has been rendered in a stained glass style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spiral patterns of the cosmic vortex outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines resembling lead cames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral patterns and various sections are indeed outlined with thick, dark lines that are continuous and resemble the lead cames used in traditional stained glass to hold pieces together. This visual element reinforces the stained glass appearance by clearly defining individual sections within the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sky and tree canopies depicted using deep, saturated colors such as deep blues, purples, reds, and greens characteristic of jewel tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses vibrant and saturated colors typical of jewel tones, particularly in the trees and the sky area. These rich colors are often found in stained glass, providing a dramatic and vivid quality associated with jewel tones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the stained glass elements (including the spiral and trees) exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures that simulate light refraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork in Image B is rendered with angular, sharply segmented sections characteristic of stained glass, giving these elements a multi-faceted appearance that resembles light playing through glass. This simulates the light refraction effect seen in actual stained glass windows, implying these elements are designed to capture and play with light.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature soft, glowing light effects, smooth color transitions, and balanced composition that evoke a sense of calm and serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In contrast to Image A, Image B does not feature the same soft, glowing light effects or smooth transitions. Instead, it relies on the segmented, angular nature of stained glass, which lacks the smooth and soft light transitions that create a sense of calm. The overall composition is more dynamic and vibrant rather than serene.",
