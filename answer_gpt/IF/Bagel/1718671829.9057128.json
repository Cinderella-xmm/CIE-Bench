    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the structural lines of the cabin composed entirely of geometric shapes with no organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structural lines of the cabin are depicted using straight, angular lines that are characteristic of geometric shapes. There are no visible organic curves, which often include smooth, flowing lines. The design is very angular and abstract, suggesting a stylized and geometric approach.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a glowing, radiant circle with visible light rays or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial body is illustrated as a circle with no visible light rays or halo effects, following a simplistic, stylized approach. It resembles a bold, geometric shape common in abstract art rather than a naturalistic depiction of a glowing moon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the plants rendered in symmetrical, patterned arrangements instead of natural growth forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area that represents plants is depicted with very stylized, patterned lines and shapes. They lack the irregularity and organic nature typically found in natural plant growth, and instead seem to be intentionally arranged in a symmetrical, patterned manner, characteristic of abstract or decorative art styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are metallic textures and colors (gold and silver) visibly applied to key elements such as the cabin frame, windows, or decorative motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette predominantly uses gold and silver-like tones, especially on the frames, windows, and various other elements. This choice of colors and texture appearance mimics metallic surfaces, adding a luxurious or stylized sheen typical of artistic renderings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there abstract, geometrically shaped clouds present in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are designed with abstract, geometric forms, departing from the fluffy, natural shapes typical of clouds. They consist of simple, rounded shapes and angular outlines, fitting the overall geometric and abstract style of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the windows display bold, dynamic features such as thick frames, angular divisions, or radiating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows are characterized by bold, angular lines and divisions that create a dynamic appearance. The frames are thick and integrated into the overall geometric style of the illustration, which enhances the dynamic and stylized nature of the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a flat, graphic quality with strong symmetry, angular lines, and decorative elements characteristic of Art Deco posters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a composition with a flat, graphic quality, characterized by strong symmetry and angular lines. The use of geometric shapes, metallic colors, and decorative patterns reminiscent of Art Deco design lend the image a stylized, poster-like aesthetic. This overall visual treatment aligns well with Art Deco's distinct style.",
