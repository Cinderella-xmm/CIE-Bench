      "question": "Has the grand piano been reimagined as a luxury cosmetics product display, clearly shifting its purpose from musical instrument to cosmetic packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano is shown with features that are uncharacteristic of a traditional musical instrument. The inside of the piano has been converted into what appears to be cosmetics storage and display, with visible eyeshadow palettes in typical cosmetic shades. This transformation of the piano's interior suggests its primary use has been altered from music to cosmetics, which aligns with characteristics of luxury cosmetic display packaging.",

      "question": "Has the piano lid been transformed into a compact mirror case with a reflective surface and a design consistent with a high-end makeup compact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lid of the piano in Image B is propped open, and while the surface design seems consistent with a compact makeup display, there is no clear indication of a reflective mirror surface, a feature common in makeup compacts. The design suggests the possibility, but without explicit visual cues confirming a mirror specifically, the question cannot be fully affirmed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area typically reserved for the keyboard has been replaced by an array of circular cosmetics that resemble individually packaged eyeshadows, arranged in a grid-like structure similar to palettes seen in makeup kits.
