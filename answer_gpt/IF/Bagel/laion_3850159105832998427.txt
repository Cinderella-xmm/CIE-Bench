    "Question": "Q1: Has the body of the guitar been transformed into a dragon's torso with organic, beast-like features such as scales or musculature?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a dragon featuring organic scales and defined musculature, typical of mythical beast representations, rather than the wooden body of a guitar seen in Image A.

    "Question": "Q2: Has the guitar neck been reshaped into an elongated, elegant dragon neck that extends naturally from the torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see a distinct, elongated neck characteristic of a dragon, which extends naturally from its torso.

    "Question": "Q3: Have the original tuning pegs been replaced with golden, horn-like spikes on the headstock?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a dragon with horn-like features, but they appear as part of the dragon's anatomical structure rather than as tuning pegs on a guitar. In Image A, the tuning pegs are clearly visible as standard metallic knobs on the guitar. Thus, the transformation visible does not specifically replace tuning pegs with horn-like spikes.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are there visible luminescent runes embedded or drawn along the fretboard of the guitar?",
    "explanation": "Image B features glowing runes down the dragonâ€™s body, creating an effect similar to luminescent markings.

    "Question": "Q5: Have the guitar strings been replaced with fiery, flame-like tendrils that extend from the bridge to the nut?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not portray any guitar strings as flame-like tendrils. Instead, it visualizes a dragon with intricate details. In contrast, Image A features actual strings on the guitar. The image description for Image B shows typical dragon anatomy rather than transforming guitar strings into any tendril-like form.",

    "Question": "Q6: Have the cutaway horns of the guitar been transformed into majestic wings featuring intricate, scale-like patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays large, majestic wings with scale-like patterns, a design choice that reflects dragon imagery. In contrast, Image A features the cutaway horns of a guitar, which are solid and lack such patterns or thematic elements. This illustrates the transformation from structured guitar cutaways to organically intricate wings.",
