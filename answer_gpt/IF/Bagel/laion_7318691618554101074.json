      "question": "Are all makeup brushes replaced with sculpted crystal wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects contained within the vessel are not makeup brushes but appear to be sculpted crystal wands, characterized by clear, rod-like structures with colorful gemstones at the tips. Analyzing the visual cues, one notices the absence of any brush bristles or handles typical of makeup brushes. Common sense knowledge tells us that makeup brushes typically have a distinct brush head, unlike the structured, transparent rods with gem tips seen here. Image A, on the other hand, contains multiple makeup brushes, each with distinctive brush heads. Therefore, all makeup brushes from Image A have been replaced with crystal wands in Image B.",

      "question": "Does each crystal wand have a unique gemstone at its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each wand has a gemstone at its tip, with each gem showing a different color: red, blue, green, and smaller clear ones. Analyzing these visual cues, it is apparent that each wand tip is adorned with a uniquely colored gemstone. By comparing with Image A, there is no such option of varied colors at the tips of brushes; hence, in Image B, each wand indeed has a unique gemstone at its tip.",

      "question": "Is the container a transparent crystal vase with visible etched floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a container that has the characteristics of a transparent crystal vase, which is evident from its clarity and cut that reflects light. Furthermore, it has visible floral patterns etched into its surface, noted by the repetitive flower and leaf designs seen on the exterior. Analyzing this visual design, it stands in contrast to Image A, which is a simpler glass container using decorative lace instead of etched patterns. Therefore, the container in Image B is distinctly a crystal vase with visible etched floral patterns.",

      "question": "Has the lace band been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible lace band around the container. Instead, the container itself is made of crystal, featuring etched floral patterns. Analyzing the visual details, the patterns are part of the vase itself, not a separate ribbon. In Image A, a lace band adorns the top of the container, but no such feature appears in Image B. Therefore, the lace band has been replaced by the inherent floral etching on the crystal vase.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is reflective and appears to mirror both the crystal vase and the wands above it. Careful observation of the surface's reflection indicates a mirrored quality typical of a shiny, glass-like surface. Image A also uses a similar reflective base that seemingly mirrors the makeup brushes and container placed on it. Thus, in Image B, the arrangement is placed on a mirrored surface, which reflects the crystal vase and wands.",
