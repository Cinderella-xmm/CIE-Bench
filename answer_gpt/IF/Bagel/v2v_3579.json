      "question": "Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are meticulously arranged to form the shape of the United States map, not a person. Upon analyzing the image, the sushi rolls and pieces outline the various states and geographical features of this map. By using world knowledge, particularly in visual representation and geography, I can conclude that there is no effort to create a human form, such as head, arms, or legs, traditionally associated with person figures in art or design.",

      "question": "Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no representation of a person figure, and consequently, no right arm present. The image depicts sushi pieces arranged to form the geographical map of the United States, composed of states rather than body parts. By applying common sense and understanding the visual cues provided, such as the orientation and structure of the sushi pieces corresponding to specific regions rather than limbs, it is clear that there is no lifting or even presence of an arm.",

    {

      "question": "Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces in Image B are placed to depict the map of the United States, and there is no visual interpretation of a person, thus no bodily elements such as a left arm. World knowledge in geography and interpretation of pictorial data allows for assessing the map rather than anatomical parts of a person. Observing the arrangement and intent of the sushi pieces clarifies that there is no intention or presence of a human figure, leading to the conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon viewing Image B, it's apparent that the sushi pieces are structured as a representation of the US map. By exercising common sense and knowledge about visual depiction, the absence of body parts such as legs can be validated, owing to the systematic outline of states and regions instead of anatomical limbs. The strategic placement of the sushi rolls adheres to geographical representation rather than any semblance to a human form, reaffirming there are no legs depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head of the person figure represented by sushi pieces and distinguishable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays sushi pieces arranged to symbolize the US map rather than a person. With the application of visual knowledge and common sense deduced from the design, there is no indication or implication of a human figure, including a head. The image uses sushi pieces in an organized fashion to represent state boundaries rather than human features, making any personal anatomical interpretation non-existent or misplaced.",
