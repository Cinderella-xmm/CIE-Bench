      "question": "Are the hat and scarf now made of wood with visible carving marks and engraved textures that mimic the original woolly pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf are crafted from wood, showcasing visible carving marks that give them a textured appearance. These engravings mimic a pattern that can be associated with a woolly design, even though it is made from wood. This transformation from a possibly fabric material in an unedited state to wood is evident in the detailed textured engravings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the dog's fur coat been replaced with LEGO bricks arranged in a way that shows multiple colors and maintains a layered, textured appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dog figure constructed from LEGO bricks, where the coat consists of multiple colors and maintains a structured, almost layered look. The use of bricks imparts a textured resemblance to fur while the colors add complexity, resembling how fur shifts in gradient and shape in real life.",

      "question": "Is the background now a plain, light-colored wooden tabletop with no distracting elements, providing a clean contrast to the dog and its accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that mimics a light-colored, wooden tabletop. This backdrop is clean and uniform, without additional elements that could detract attention from the foreground object, which is consistent with the description of providing a clean contrast.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the dogâ€™s facial features, including eyes, nose, mouth, and expression, remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's facial features are crafted from wood with distinct carvings. The eyes, nose, mouth, and expression are detailed immaculately similar to what one might expect in Image A, emphasizing expression within a different medium but maintaining characteristic elements like prominent eyes and a smile.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used for the coat composed of warm colors such as orange, red, yellow, or brown to visually suggest warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat of the dog figure includes LEGO bricks in various colors, which do not primarily consist of warm tones like orange, red, yellow, or brown. The bricks are more diverse in color, such as red, blue, and green, diverting from a consistent warm color theme.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the scene still include falling snow, and if so, does it coexist logically with the wooden background and LEGO brick coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not reflect any aspects of falling snow usually seen in a realistic depiction. Instead, the setting consists solely of objects made from other materials, principally wood and LEGO bricks, with no visible elements of falling snow to consider the coexistence with the context.",
