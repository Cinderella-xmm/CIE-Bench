      "question": "Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B is visibly constructed from LEGO-style bricks. Each component of the chair, including the seat, backrest, armrests, and base, shows the characteristic studs and blocky appearance typical of LEGO constructions. This visible construction method is evident due to the protruding studs and interlocking brick pattern observed on the chair.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the seat and the backrest sections of the chair are constructed using black LEGO bricks. These bricks provide a sleek look typical of LEGO structures, maintaining a consistent, shiny, black appearance that resembles a low-luster plastic surface often found in LEGO constructions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests in Image B are not silver but are constructed using light gray LEGO bricks with a smooth, plastic-like sheen. The base of the chair is also constructed using a similar light gray color, consistent with the LEGO aesthetic but not silver in hue.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each of the chairâ€™s wheels is constructed from LEGO bricks that appear translucent with a slight gray hue. This is consistent with the look of translucent LEGO pieces, supporting the notion that they are translucent gray in appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the seat and backrest of the chair are composed of stacked LEGO bricks. However, there are no smooth gradients between them; the bricks have distinct and abrupt edges characteristic of LEGO construction, without any transitioning color gradients.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests in Image B are constructed from LEGO bricks and have a distinctly blocky, geometric appearance without any additional complex padding or curvature. They lack the intricacy of hinged parts and appear simplistic in design, consistent with straightforward LEGO constructions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface on which the chair is placed in Image B appears to be plain and light-colored, resembling a white tabletop common in product photography, with minimal texture or visual elements suggesting complexity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a chair that highlights its geometric and modular assembly, which is highlighted through the clearly visible edges and lines of the LEGO bricks, typical of such constructions. These edges and lines distinctly define each part of the chair, underlining its blocky, modular LEGO build.",
