      "question": "Is there a ketchup bottle positioned in the lower-right corner of the image, angled slightly toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a red bottle located in the lower-right corner of the image, which visually resembles a ketchup bottle due to its shape and color. It appears to be angled slightly toward the center of the image. Common knowledge suggests that such bottles are typically used for condiments like ketchup, especially given the context with other ketchup-themed elements in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'The king of flavors' is prominently displayed across the middle upper section of the image, spread horizontally. The text is positioned above the dinosaur's back, making it central and highly visible within the image composition.",

      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” crafted in a glossy, ketchup-style script font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'The king of flavors' in Image B appears to be styled in a way that mimics the texture of ketchup. The font has a glossy appearance, resembling the thick and shiny consistency typically associated with ketchup, giving it a thematic coherence with the rest of the image, which includes a ketchup bottle.",

      "question": "Do the letters of “The king of flavors” appear to hover in the air and subtly mingle with the mist of the forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the letters of 'The king of flavors' do indeed appear to be floating in front of the background scene. The depth effect is such that the text looks like it is part of the scene, subtly interacting with the misty forest setting, enhancing the impression that they are hovering in the air.",

      "question": "Are there streams of ketchup visually linking back to the opened bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the bottle has a design on it that suggests the idea of ketchup, particularly with the label, there are no visible streams of ketchup connecting the bottle to any other element in the image, such as the text or the dinosaur. The composition suggests a sense of theme without literal streams of ketchup depicted.",
