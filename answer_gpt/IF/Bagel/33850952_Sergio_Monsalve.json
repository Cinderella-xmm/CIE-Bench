    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the building facade now appear as an organic, alien-like structure rather than a conventional architectural design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is an alien-like creature with a head and tentacles, resembling something from a sci-fi fantasy setting rather than any kind of architectural design. This is in contrast to the conventional building facade in Image A. Therefore, the edited image depicts an organic, alien-like entity.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the curved elements of the building transformed into distinct tentacle-like appendages extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is an alien creature with multiple tentacles. These tentacles extend outward and are very distinct in form. Image A features a facade with curved architectural lines, so the transformation into tentacle-like appendages is clear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are fibrous, strand-like textures visibly applied across sections of the buildingâ€™s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alien creature has a detailed texture that resembles fibrous strands across its surface, giving it a very organic and biological appearance. The building in Image A does not have such textures. The edited image clearly shows the fibrous detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all window surfaces been replaced with translucent, membrane-like panels that appear soft and non-rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no windows; instead, the creature's head features smooth, bulbous surfaces. The windows from Image A's facade are not present in this organic form, though there's no specific indication of them being membrane-like or translucent panels. Therefore, the answer is more accurately no complete transformation into translucent, membrane-like panels has occurred.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal surface detailed with overlapping, iridescent scale-like patterns that reflect multiple colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alien creature displays smooth surfaces with a subtle, iridescent glow, especially along its contours and tentacles. However, it does not show overlapping, scale-like patterns as one might expect of scales on a fish or reptile. Therefore, such detailed scale-like patterning is not evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there glowing, bio-luminescent lines along the edges of the structure that emit an eerie, unnatural light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, Image B features an alien creature with glowing lines along its contours and tentacles, suggesting a bio-luminescent property that emits an unnatural light. This is distinctive when compared to Image A's conventional facade with no glowing elements.",
