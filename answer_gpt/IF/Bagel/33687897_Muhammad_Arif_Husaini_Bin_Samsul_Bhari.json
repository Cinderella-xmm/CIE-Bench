      "question": "Has the mountain been transformed into a colossal mythical creature with distinct features such as a head, wings, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain is transformed into a creature by adding features such as a distinct head, defined limbs, and wing-like structures. The original form and context of the mountain are altered to resemble a colossal mythical creature. This transformation is clear due to the humanoid and fantastical traits imposed on the mountain structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the mythical creature exhibit a stone-like texture throughout its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a surface that appears rocky and textured like stone. This analysis is based on the visual information of a rough, stone-like surface that aligns with the common representation of mythical golem-like creatures or rock giants.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the peak of the mountain clearly shaped and stylized as the head of the creature, including rock-carved eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peak of what was a mountain in Image A is stylized into the head of a creature, complete with rock-carved eyes that give an animated and mythical appearance. This transformation is evident by the addition of features typically associated with a head, such as eyes.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the ridges of the mountain extend outward into large, wing-like structures that appear to be part of the creature’s anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that parts of the mountain's ridges have been artistically transformed to resemble large, wing-like extensions that could be interpreted as part of the creature's design, indicating a departure from the mountain's natural lines to elements that suggest wings.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the roots of the mountain transformed into limb-like structures that are visibly intertwined with the silhouettes of the foreground trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, extensions resembling limbs stretch from the creature and may give the impression of interacting with the environment, but they are not distinctly drawn into the trees' silhouettes. The limbs are part of the creature’s anatomy but do not appear visibly intertwined with the trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features glowing, vein-like structures across the creature’s body. However, these structures emit light in shades of orange, which are different from the blue and pink hues mentioned in the question. The analysis includes noting the visual effect of the glowing lines diverging from the typical dark texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouetted trees from Image A remain in Image B. The creature's limbs appear to coexist with these trees, maintaining the backdrop’s integrity while adding the creature’s features. The visual continuity suggests a natural integration between the creature and existing environmental elements.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The misty layer that was evident in Image A continues to be visible in Image B, creating a consistent hazy effect that adds a sense of scale and mystique to the creature by providing a cloud-like base at its foundation, continuing the natural atmospheric conditions depicted.",
