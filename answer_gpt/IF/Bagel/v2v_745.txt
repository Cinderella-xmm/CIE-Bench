    "Question": "Q1: Are the backgrounds of all stickers transparent?",
    "explanation": "The stickers are presented in a format where the background is largely not visible due to the presence of a consistent white border surrounding each character. This suggests that the stickers themselves have a defined shape and the use of the white border typically indicates they are not on a transparent background.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stickers arranged in a 3x3 grid?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the stickers are clearly placed in a 3x3 grid formation as there are three rows and three columns of stickers. This is visually apparent by counting and noting the consistent alignment and spacing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do all stickers have a square 1:1 aspect ratio?",
    "explanation": "The stickers feature varying outlines corresponding to the characters they depict, which include white borders. Given the variety in the character shapes, sizes, and actions, it is unlikely that all stickers strictly adhere to a square 1:1 aspect ratio.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do all stickers uniformly depict a Chibi-style aesthetic reminiscent of Ghibli with lively and bold colors?",

The interpretation is subjective, but the resemblance lacks in vibrancy akin to Ghibli.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Does each sticker portray a distinct travel-related action, emotion, or theme?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all characters in the stickers fully depicted without any missing features?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are there any disconnected or unrelated elements within the stickers?",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Are there any texts in the stickers, or if present, are they entirely accurate?",

    "answer": "No"
