      "question": "Are Norse motifs such as runic patterns, interlacing designs, or dragon heads visibly integrated into the artwork of the ship on the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, it is evident that the Viking ship artwork on the box includes several Norse motifs. The dragon heads are particularly noticeable at both the bow and stern. Additionally, the sail features a circular knotwork pattern consistent with traditional Norse design. These elements are characteristic of Norse artwork and are integrated into the shipâ€™s design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Voyage of the Vikings' is shown in large, bold typography across the upper portion of the box cover.

      "question": "Is the circular knotwork pattern from the sail used as part of a game board layout, such as a grid or path system, within the box artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the circular knotwork pattern prominently on the sail of the Viking ship, but there is no indication or visual cues in the box artwork suggesting that this pattern is used as a part of a game board layout, such as a grid or path system. The pattern is decorative and appears to be part of the ship's design rather than a functional game element.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small, stylized figures resembling rowers can be seen along the side of the Viking ship depicted on the game box artwork. These figures are aligned as if they are rowing, consistent with the design of Viking ships traditionally crewed by oarsmen.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the side panels of the game box, and there is no visible wooden texture or grain pattern. The side panels are decorated with thematic artwork and font, matching the styling of the front cover, but do not mimic wood texture.",
