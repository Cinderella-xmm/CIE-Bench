      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four separate images or prints shown, each featuring the fisherman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four distinct rectangular images or prints, each depicting the same fisherman in a similar environment. Each of these images is framed distinctly, indicating they are separate prints. The frames are consistent, and the fisherman is positioned centrally in each one, reinforcing that there are indeed four separate images presented.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the fisherman exhibit exaggerated proportions, simplified facial features, and bold outlines characteristic of semi-cartoon art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fisherman in Image B has a more stylized representation than realistic, with clear outlines and patterns visible on his clothing and hat, though the face is blurred. However, the emphasis on bold outlines and exaggerated features, which are typical of a semi-cartoon style, isn't strongly present here. Instead, the artwork leans more towards a realistic style with detailed textures and shading.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the texture of the fisherman's hat and plaid shirt visibly more detailed and pronounced compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, there is no significant increase in detail in the textures of the fisherman's hat and plaid shirt. Both images showcase these items with a detailed texture, but Image B does not surpass the level of detail observed in Image A. The textures remain visually consistent between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the fishing rod been replaced with a golden-colored wand-like object that resembles a magical staff?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object the fisherman is holding is a golden, wand-like staff rather than a traditional fishing rod. This object has characteristics such as a round tip, suggesting a magical essence or function, which is different from the fishing rod seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing, swirling, or ornamental ripples on the surface of the water that suggest magical effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible circular patterns and designs around the fisherman where the water meets the wand, which suggest a magical effect. These swirls and ripples differ from typical water movement, implying a magical or ornate design element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is each of the four prints enclosed in a wooden frame that shows signs of distress (such as scratches or weathering) and has raised pine tree patterns embossed on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frames enclosing each print in Image B are wooden and appear to have an embossed pattern resembling pine trees or some kind of foliage. The frames are uniform and artistically detailed, adding a thematic touch but not notably distressed or weathered. The raised patterns are present and contribute to the frameâ€™s design.",
