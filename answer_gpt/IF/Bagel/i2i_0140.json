      "question": "Does the image display a soft hand-painted texture characteristic of watercolor illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the visual appearance shows a texture that appears fluid, with colors that seem to blend into one another without sharp edges, which is typical of watercolor illustrations. This effect is achieved by a lack of defined lines and a smooth, gradient-like transition between colors that resemble brush strokes. This suggests the use of watercolor techniques.",

      "question": "Are the bedding patterns from the original image preserved in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A, the original, shows bedding with distinct geometric star patterns and specific color placements. In Image B, although the watercolor effect has altered the clarity and sharpness of the patterns, the transformation into fluid shapes and blended colors means that detailed original patterns like the stars are not preserved. Instead, they are abstracted into more general shapes and colors.",

      "question": "Do the colors in the image exhibit a soft blending typical of watercolor paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays characteristics of watercolor paintings, where colors are not sharply outlined and appear to diffuse softly into each other, creating a blended effect. This is evident from how the colors transition seamlessly across boundaries, without distinct borders between them, to create an overall softer appearance typical of watercolor works.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible brush stroke textures or subtle variations in shading throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains visual qualities that suggest subtle variations in shading and texture that mimic brush strokes. The watercolor style naturally includes these variations due to the application technique, and the edited image reflects a textured appearance that mimics traditional watercolor brushwork, with subtle gradients and overlaps of colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can detailed designs in the bedding, like the star patterns, still be clearly seen after conversion to the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows detailed star patterns on the bedding, using distinct and contrasting colors. In Image B, the watercolor style transforms these patterns into more abstract forms, with smudged outlines and blended colors. This style inherently obscures detailed designs, so the specific sharpness and clarity of the star patterns are lost, making them difficult to discern.",
