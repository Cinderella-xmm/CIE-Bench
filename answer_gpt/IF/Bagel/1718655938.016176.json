      "question": "Does the edited image display a cartoonish or animated visual style with exaggerated proportions and simplified forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements like the church, trees, and surrounding environment are presented in a very vibrant and whimsical manner with bold colors and simplified shapes. This style is typically associated with cartoonish or animated illustrations. Such characteristics distinguish Image B from realistic depiction, emphasizing a more playful and stylized approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the church simplified and exaggerated, with bold lines and minimal fine architectural detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's outlines are distinctly simplified compared to real architectural details. The use of bright colors and minimal line work to suggest shapes rather than finely detailing them is a common trait of exaggerated and simplified illustration styles. The emphasis is on visual impact rather than architectural precision.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the stained-glass windows feature bright, colorful, and stylized patterns that differ from realistic depictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the stained-glass windows in bright, saturated colors with a design that suits a stylized, animated aesthetic rather than realistic artistry. These windows contribute to the overall cartoonish style by using bold, vivid colors and simple geometric patterns, unlike complex and intricate real-world stained glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all pine trees been replaced with objects resembling candy, such as lollipops, gumdrops, or striped candies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and objects around the church take the form of candy-like items, such as oversized lollipops and gumdrop-like elements, consistent with a whimsical, candy-themed style. This transformation from realistic pine trees to candy objects contributes to the image's playful and fantastical tone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sky composed of a swirling, pastel-colored patchwork quilt pattern rather than a natural twilight sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B deviates significantly from a naturally occurring twilight sky. Instead, it manifests a swirling, pastel patchwork pattern that suggests a whimsical, dream-like canvas. This visual style contrasts the realistic depiction of the sky in Image A, focusing on a playful artistic expression rather than representing a sky as we see it in the real world.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the church still positioned centrally along a winding path, surrounded by the transformed forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Images A and B, the church remains centrally positioned on a path. Despite the transformation of the surrounding landscape into a candy-themed environment, this central positioning provides a consistent focal point, serving as the main element around which both environments are constructed. This maintains the compositional layout even with the dramatic environmental changes.",
