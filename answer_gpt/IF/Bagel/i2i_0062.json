      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in question shows a character with typical chibi features â€“ a large head, small body, and simplified details. In anime and manga styles, these proportions are characteristic of chibi depictions. Given the oversized head and cartoonish style of the character, it can be concluded that the skateboarder is depicted as a chibi cartoon character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chibi-style character is shown wearing clothing that visually appears to consist of a gray T-shirt and shorts. The simple coloring and style, typical of a cartoon representation, clearly illustrate these items of clothing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters are often defined by having a disproportionately large head compared to their body. The edited image's character follows this convention as the head is noticeably larger, which is typical for representing characters in the chibi style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in the edited image maintains the basic outline and key features of a real skateboard, such as the deck and wheels, but is simplified and stylized to match the cartoon character. This level of simplification indicates that the skateboard has been cartoonified yet remains recognizable as a skateboard.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background features a depiction that consists of basic, simplified outlines representing buildings in a city skyline. This reduction of detail and stylization suggest the skyline is hand-drawn in a simplistic manner, which fits the overall cartoon theme.",
