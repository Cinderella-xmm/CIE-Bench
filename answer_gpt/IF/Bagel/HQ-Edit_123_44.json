      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft appears to have a stylized look, resembling a 3D model with exaggerated features and smooth, simplified surfaces which are typical of stylized renderings, unlike photorealistic depictions that aim to closely mimic real-world details. This conclusion is drawn by observing the overall polished and cartoon-like appearance of the model inside the display case.",
