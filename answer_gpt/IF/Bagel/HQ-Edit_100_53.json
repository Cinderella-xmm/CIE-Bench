      "question": "Does the edited image feature bold black outlines around figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are distinct thick black outlines present around the major figures and objects, such as the person and pathway objects. This stylistic choice is characteristic of traditional Japanese ukiyo-e art, where outlines define forms and provide a clear separation between elements. These bold outlines are consistent with the hand-drawn aesthetic typical in woodblock prints.",

      "question": "Are the colors on the kimono flat and uniform without gradients or realistic shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in the edited image features colors that are flat and uniform, lacking gradients or realistic shading. Each color area, such as in the florals on the kimono, has a consistent tone, without the variation in brightness or shadows that would appear in a more realistic depiction. This simplified color application is consistent with the approach seen in woodblock prints, which rely on large patches of color.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted with simplified shapes and muted pink hues rather than vibrant or detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the cherry blossoms are presented using simplified shapes and muted pink hues. They lack the intricate details and vibrant colors found in a more complex representation, maintaining a stylized approach. This simplification aligns with traditional techniques seen in ukiyo-e artworks, which often use minimal detail to convey broader natural scenes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the path stones and poles feature visible textured patterns resembling hand-carved or woodblock-style designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The path stones and poles in the edited image appear as flat with minimal texture, lacking the detailed patterns typically found in hand-carved items. The representation is simple and uniform, consistent with the clean stylization used in woodblock prints. This choice minimizes details to focus on overall pattern and composition rather than detailed surface texturing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background include stylized distant rolling hills rendered in a manner consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape compositions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, stylized distant rolling hills are visible and are consistent with the traditional compositional methods found in ukiyo-e landscapes. The hills are simplified with minimal detail, emphasizing their shape over their texture and color variation. This approach is common in Japanese woodblock prints, which use broad shapes to represent natural features.",
