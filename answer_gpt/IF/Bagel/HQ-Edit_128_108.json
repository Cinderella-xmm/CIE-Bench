      "question": "Is the ornate lantern now presented as a candle brand packaging rather than a hanging light fixture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a vertical packaging design that features elements reminiscent of a brand design, indicated by the presence of a logo and text that suggest branding, not just decorative lighting. The ornate decorations on top of the packaging are visually similar to intricate metal or glass work. This suggests that the focus has shifted from a practical hanging light fixture in Image A to product packaging in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
