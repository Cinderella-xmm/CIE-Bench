      "question": "Have the vegetables and knife been broken down into geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that the elements originally recognized as vegetables and a knife have been represented using distinct geometric shapes such as cubes and arcs. This representation indicates an abstraction process where natural forms are transformed into more simplified shapes, often characteristic of art styles like Cubism. Therefore, based on the visual transformation into geometric forms, it can be concluded that the objects have indeed been broken down in this manner.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an arrangement where the geometric shapes do not conform to a realistic depiction of vegetables and a knife as observed in real life. Instead, they appear in a pattern that emphasizes form and color over realistic representation. This kind of arrangement is indicative of an abstract manner, where the focus is on visual interpretation rather than life-like accuracy.",

      "question": "Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the abstraction and geometric simplification in Image B, the context and the shapes used allow for the recognition of the original subjects â€“ the orange cubes suggestive of carrots, green arcs for celery, white cubes for onions, and a large blue shape as a knife. These identifiable elements support the conclusion that recognition is still feasible due to retained characteristic features.",

      "question": "Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are vivid and tend towards a more primary palette with less subtle shading, typical in some Cubist artworks where colors serve to enhance the geometric abstraction rather than naturalistic depiction. This palette simplification aligns with Cubist techniques that often forgo detailed color gradations.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits overlapping geometric shapes and lacks a coherent singular perspective, which is a trait of Cubism. This visual strategy creates a multi-faceted perception of the subjects, embodying multiple angles and dimensions on a two-dimensional surface, which is characteristic of Cubist artwork.",
