    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a plush toy. The visual cues like the soft, velvety brown and cream fabric, the sewn-on eyes, and the overall simplistic and symmetrical features indicate that it is a plush representation of a husky, unlike a live animal that would show detailed fur texture, natural eyes, and more complex anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paws of the plush toy are rounded and oversized, a common characteristic in plush toys to give a cute and cuddly appearance. This differs from the realistic proportions of a live husky's paws seen in Image A, where they are more proportional to the body size.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plush toy where the entire surface is made of a velvety fabric which is smooth and uniform. This contrasts with the detailed and complex fur texture seen in live animals like the husky in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the plush toy, including the eyes, are stylized and appear to be embroidered or sewn, giving them a simple, cartoon-like appearance. This is distinctly different from the realistic eyes of the live husky in Image A, which show depth and natural reflection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the plush toy standing on a flat surface that visually resembles a clean wooden shelf, as indicated by its smooth, light-colored texture and straight edges. This contrasts with the snowy ground seen beneath the live husky in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background minimalist, without any natural elements like snow, trees, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain wall with a neutral color, providing a minimalist setting. There are no natural elements like snow, trees, or sky visible, unlike in Image A which features a snowy landscape with trees and a cloudy sky.",
