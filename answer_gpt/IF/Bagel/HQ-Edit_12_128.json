      "question": "Is the clock's frame made of translucent crystal instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame of the clock appears to be made of a clear and reflective material, which is indicative of crystal, rather than opaque and textured like wood. The light reflections and clarity suggest a crystal construction. In Image A, the frame has a wooden appearance, with a textured and brown surface typical of wood grain. Thus, the clock in Image B is made of translucent crystal.",

      "question": "Are the ornamental details and frame of the clock crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the ornamental details and frame of the clock have a frosted appearance with a pattern and texture consistent with frosted crystal, lacking the defined carvings typically seen in wood. In Image A, such details are carved from wood, exhibiting clear wood patterns. Therefore, the clock in Image B is crafted from frosted crystal.",

      "question": "Is the clock face made of smooth, clear crystal with etched Roman numerals instead of a wooden face with painted numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B is smooth and clear, suggesting a crystal material with Roman numerals that appear etched, reflecting light in a manner consistent with crystal surfaces. In contrast, Image A's clock face is textured and brown, consistent with wood, with painted numerals. Therefore, the clock face in Image B is made of clear crystal.",

      "question": "Has the pendulum been replaced with a faceted crystal ornament instead of a solid wooden disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum is depicted as a multifaceted and clear ornament resembling a crystal, displaying light refraction. Image A shows a solid, circular wooden disc pendulum. The visual characteristics of the pendulum in Image B match that of a crystal ornament.",

      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a minimalist white marble wall with visible natural veining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is of a white surface with a sleek finish and natural lines running through it, indicative of marble veining. Image A shows a textured wall without such veining. Therefore, the wall behind the clock in Image B appears to be white marble with natural veining.",
