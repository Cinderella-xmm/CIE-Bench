        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of an icon that appears to represent a lifeguard tower with a flat, simplistic style typical of minimalist icons. There is no visual cue of a yellow rescue vehicle in this image, suggesting a focus on simplifying the lifeguard tower itself into a minimalist form. The icon's reduction into basic geometric shapes aligns with the characteristics of minimalist design.",
