      "question": "Is the animal composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles arranged to form its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal is visibly made up of numerous small tiles that fit together, resembling a mosaic. The tiles are distinct and create a patchwork effect over the animal's body. This suggests that the animal is indeed composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles. The small tiles are arranged in a way that covers the surface of the animal uniformly in a distinct pattern characteristic of mosaic art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate that the animal is covered in tiles that include vibrant orange tiles interspersed with darker, almost black tiles. These colors form the stripes on the animal's body, and the tiles have a glossy finish that reflects light, enhancing their vibrancy. This observation is consistent with the description provided in the question.",

      "question": "Are the eyes and snout formed from precisely cut ceramic tiles that maintain their expressive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is evident that the eyes and snout are constructed from tiles. Despite being constructed from tiles, these features maintain their expressive appearance due to the precise cutting and arrangement of the tiles, allowing for details such as the circular shape of the eyes and the contours of the snout to be clearly depicted.",

      "question": "Is the mosaic animal positioned on a surface with a visible sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mosaic animal placed on a surface that exhibits a fine, sandy texture. The platform beneath it does not appear smooth and has a texture resembling sandpaper or closely packed fine sand, which contrasts with the smooth, glossy mosaic tiles covering the animal.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the smooth, glossy surface of the tiles and the rough, granular texture of the platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly shows two contrasting textures: the smooth and glossy appearance of the ceramic tiles making up the animal, and the rough, granular texture of the platform it rests on. This contrast is visually distinct and enhances the overall composition of the image, highlighting the difference in material surfaces.",
