    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the statue and its base fully enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable transparent glass dome that partially encloses the elements within it. The visual cues indicate that this dome surrounds the objects inside it, covering them completely from the top. This suggests a protective enclosure over the elements inside, typical of display cases.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the statue been transformed into a sleek, metallic 3D figure with a reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects inside the transparent dome in Image B appear to be transformed into an artistic and modern representation rather than a traditional sculpture. These objects have a reflective, metallic appearance, which suggests a transformation from the original form to a more contemporary 3D figure.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale trees with translucent or semi-transparent leaves surrounding the metallic figure inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a set of small 3D structures that resemble trees, with their leaves having a semi-transparent or translucent quality. These visual cues indicate an artistic representation of trees within the dome, surrounding the central figure.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows small plaques placed on top of and inside the dome that seem to have text written on them. This indicates the inclusion of plaques that likely serve to give historical or descriptive information about the scene presented.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Does the stand beneath the glass dome feature a polished stone surface with delicate vine patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base on which the glass dome stands appears to be smooth and may be represented as polished-like surfaces, and it features intricate vine patterns that are visually apparent. This suggests that the base has been artistically designed as part of the overall scene.",
