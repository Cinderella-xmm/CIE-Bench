      "question": "Is there a 3D chibi-style figure emerging from the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the kayak's seat area, there is a 3D chibi-style figure with distinct cartoon-like facial features. This gives the impression of a small, stylized character positioned inside the kayak. The chibi figure's appearance is characterized by a large head and a small body, typical of this art style, which suggests that it is emerging from the kayak.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure appear to be crossing the kayak’s edge and stepping into the real-world environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual information in Image B, the chibi-style figure remains confined within the boundaries of the kayak and does not extend past the kayak's edge into the surrounding environment. The figure's position and posture do not suggest any interaction with the real-world environment outside the kayak itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scene framed within a Polaroid photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall scene, including the kayak, skateboard, and chibi figure, is enclosed within a rectangular frame with a white border, reminiscent of the classic format of a Polaroid photograph. This suggests that the entire image is intended to appear as though it's captured within a Polaroid-style print.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand in the overall composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a human hand, identifiable by the skin texture and anatomy, positioned near the edge of the Polaroid photograph frame. This suggests that the image of the kayak scene is physically held by a person, contributing to the interaction with the Polaroid within the composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original kayak and skateboard still present and recognizable in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the kayak and skateboard are present and maintain their recognizable form. Despite the addition of the chibi figure and framing within a Polaroid, the core elements—kayak and skateboard—remain identifiable and unchanged in their basic structure, allowing them to be easily recognized.",
