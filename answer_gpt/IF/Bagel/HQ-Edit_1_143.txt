    "Question": "Q1: Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the scientist is characterized by simplified lines, vibrant colors, and exaggerated proportions typical of a cartoon style. The image focuses on stylized features instead of realistic details, suggesting a semi-cartoon artistic approach, distinct from realistic portrayals.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the laboratory apparatus is depicted with simplified and exaggerated lines without intricate detailing. The focus is on a stylized representation rather than realistic precision, lacking the high detail and clarity indicative of refinement.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Image B prominently features teal and white colors throughout the design. These colors provide a modern and clean aesthetic, often associated with scientific imagery, blending well with the simplistic and stylized elements present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image include multiple monthly sections, each featuring a different scientific motif such as molecular structures or data patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks clear indications of sections representing different months, nor does it prominently display scientific motifs specific to monthly divisions. The image seems focused on a single cohesive theme rather than segmented motifs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",
    "explanation": "Although Image B incorporates bold text, it does not clearly define sections or provide any futuristic or metallic header effects that would indicate tech-inspired designs above each segment. The emphasis remains on cartoon-like, rather than tech-styled visual elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains visual elements that resemble data visualizations and scientific graphics, like circular diagrams and structural layouts, though not explicitly integrated into a calendar format. These elements contribute to the thematic presentation instead.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the image display a polished, reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper?",
    "explanation": "The stylized and cartoon-like representation in Image B lacks the polished and reflective qualities typical of high-quality gloss paper. Instead, it portrays a matte finish consistent with illustration-heavy designs.",
    "answer": "No"
