      "question": "Is the king piece now depicted as a regally robed water deity with visible fluid or wave-like motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, among the figures, one is wearing a regal robe with motifs resembling waves or fluid patterns, suggesting a water deity interpretation. This figure stands prominently, akin to a king piece standing taller than others in a chess set. The robes and motifs support the idea of a water deity, which differs from the original king piece in Image A, where the shape is that of a standard, carved wooden king with no thematic detailing.",

      "question": "Is the queen piece now depicted as a regally robed fire deity with visible flame or ember-like motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no figure depicting fire or flame-like motifs that correspond to the theme of a fire deity. The figures present exhibit water or stone motifs. The original Image A queen piece is a traditional carved chess piece with no element themes, and this doesn't translate to a fire deity in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knight pieces now depicted as stone golems with carved armor and rocky textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "One figure in Image B appears to have a stone-like texture, reminiscent of a golem or guardian with carved armor. The rough, rocky look matches the description of a stone golem. This starkly contrasts with the traditional shape of a knight chess piece in Image A, commonly represented by a horse's head and neck.",

      "question": "Are the bishop pieces now depicted as ethereal, translucent wind phantoms with swirling or flowing visual effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the figures display ethereal, wind-like qualities or translucency that would suggest a wind phantom. The original bishop piece in Image A is a standard, solid wooden piece with no swirling or flowing effects which would match a wind thematic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pawn pieces now depicted as small, shimmering, and luminous sprites with glowing or reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller figures possess a glowing appearance as they flank the larger deity-like figures, resembling sprites with their luminescent nature. This depiction is a clear change from Image A, where pawns are simple, opaque pieces with no intrinsic light or glow.",

      "question": "Are the rook pieces now depicted as ancient trees with visible runes carved into their trunks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any figures resembling ancient trees with runes. The figures present are water or stone-themed, lacking vegetal characteristics that rooks as trees would necessitate. Contrast this with the firm, tower-like structure of a rook in a standard chess set, as seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Are all transformed pieces positioned in the same locations as the original chess pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning in Image B is not a direct mapping from Image A. The arrangement appears more natural and less grid-focused, depicting a scene more akin to a gathering than a chessboard setup, indicating changes in location.",
