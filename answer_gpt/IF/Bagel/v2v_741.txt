    "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, the character is a kawaii, anime-styled girl with cat ears and is wearing white and purple attire.

    "Question": "Q2: Does the character in Panel 1 have a slightly annoyed, pouting expression while holding a mouse in one hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, specifically Panel 1, there is no character showing any expression or holding a mouse. Instead, this panel features a large notebook labeled ‘XMY’.

    "Question": "Q3: Does Panel 1 include a text box with the message 'Why won’t you connect?! I followed the documentation! (；´д｀)’ written in a playful, casual handwritten font?",
    "explanation": "Panel 1 in Image B contains speech bubbles. The text reads 'Why won't coonkt! I ot fo'loenl th nolob!!' which appears to be intentionally jumbled or distorted text rather than the specific quoted message. This text does not match verbatim and is not clearly in a casual handwritten playful font.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the setting in Panel 1 a chaotic workspace with computer screens, stray coffee cups, and tangled wires?",
    "explanation": "Panel 1 of Image B shows a workspace with multiple monitors, keyboards, a mouse, and several coffee cups scattered around. However, without the degree of detail regarding 'tangled wires,' it seems more orderly than chaotic.

    "Question": "Q5: Does Panel 2 show the same desk but cleaner, with glowing code cascading across the screens?",
    "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B depicts a cartoonish trophy on a desk surrounded by computer screens showing code.
