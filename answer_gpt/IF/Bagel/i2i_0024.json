      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a flat illustration-style tennis-themed chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style suggests a simplified, cartoonish art form often associated with chibi characters, characterized by their exaggerated features and simplistic forms. The tennis player has been rendered in this flat style, which differs from the more detailed and realistic image in Image A. Chibi stickers are typically 2D and stylistically distinct from photographic images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person depicted in the same original pose as in image A?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the person is holding a tennis racket with a visibly bent arm and is dressed similarly. However, the stance and orientation of the person in Image B slightly differ as the orientation and angle appear more simplified and frontal, not precisely matching the photograph in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi sticker retain a red dress and a white hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is illustrated wearing a red dress and a white hat, which are the same colors present in the attire in Image A. Despite the change in style from photograph to illustration, the primary color scheme and clothing elements remain consistent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis racket simplified into a black-lined filled shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis racket in Image B is represented by a solid shape with bold black outlines, matching the typical stylistic approach of simplifying objects in chibi art to their essential forms, unlike the detailed look in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all three matching sticker elements—a tennis ball, a victory V-sign hand, and red clay court lines—generated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, additional elements include a tennis ball, a hand showing a victory sign, and lines reminiscent of a clay tennis court. These elements are cohesive with the tennis theme portrayed by the central character and adhere to the chibi art style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all stickers have white borders and transparent backgrounds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible sticker elements in Image B each have an outer white border, typical of sticker design, which provides a distinct separation from any background they might be placed on. The backgrounds of the stickers themselves appear non-existent or transparent, supported by the typical aesthetic of printed sticker designs.",
