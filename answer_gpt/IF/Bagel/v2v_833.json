        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are elements resembling icons or stats, similar to those found in role-playing or trading card games, located near the lower section of the card.

Instead, they have labels such as 'Sakei√∏i', 'Dakscl', and 'Saiesire' which are likely fictional stats.",
