    "Question": "Q1: Is the title 'Journey to Space' clearly displayed in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a title at the top that reads 'JOURNEY TO SPACE'. The text is in a bold, clear font occupying the uppermost region of the image, making it easily noticeable and readable. This suggests an introductory or thematic focus on a space-related topic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the astronaut figure still present and positioned centrally in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, an illustrated astronaut figure is depicted in the center, serving as the focal point of the graphic. The astronaut is wearing a space suit, similar to the one depicted in the original image, thereby maintaining continuity and focus on the central character.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the background been transformed into a mission control center with elements like control panels, screens, or consoles?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features a simplified, illustrative background without detailed elements like control panels, screens, or consoles typical of a mission control center environment. Instead, it is a graphic design with color blocks and text labels.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there four distinct illustrative icons present, each representing one of the following: Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, and Space Suit Check?",
    "explanation": "While there are multiple labels and graphics present around the illustrated astronaut in the image, these do not specifically correspond to themes like Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, and Space Suit Check. They are rather abstract markers with no clear representation of these stages.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the four training stages represented in distinct, vibrant color-coded sections (e.g., different colored backgrounds or labels)?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features several sections with different color backgrounds and labels, suggesting differentiation. However, these sections do not clearly correspond to specific training stages as they are in an abstract form with gibberish text, making it unclear if they represent training stages.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the text describing each training stage written in clean, modern typography (e.g., sans-serif font, consistent style)?",
    "explanation": "The image includes text in modern, sans-serif type fonts on several color-coded sections around the astronaut. However, the text appears to be gibberish or nonsensical phrases, and thus does not describe specific training stages.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the overall design appear cohesive and informative, with a logical flow connecting the astronaut to the training stages?",
    "explanation": "The design, while colorful and centered around an astronaut, lacks coherent and informative text that would logically connect the central graphic to training stages. The use of abstract or nonsensical text fails to provide meaningful information, affecting the design's ability to communicate a logical flow.",
    "answer": "No"
