      "question": "Has the entire cruise ship been replaced with translucent, iridescent crystal structures that resemble a palace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cruise ship has been completely transformed into a structure that looks like a crystalline palace. The shapes and textures are suggestive of translucent and iridescent crystal, which is typical for artistic depictions of fantastical or imaginative structures. This is consistent with a complete replacement of the original ship structure to achieve a palace-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the hull been replaced with clear, angular, and faceted crystal structures rather than a smooth, solid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull of the ship appears to have been altered into a form that is angular and faceted. The shape does not resemble a smooth, solid hull but rather resembles geometric crystal structures, which give the appearance of being clear and angular.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all windows been transformed into multifaceted gem-like elements with visible facets and reflective properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details on the structure include elements that could resemble multifaceted windows. These appear reflective and prism-like, which aligns with the description of gem-like elements. This change is in line with a transformation from standard windows to decorative, feature-like elements.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the decks been replaced with intricate, transparent crystal pathways featuring detailed patterns or latticework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of intricate, transparent structures suggests that the decks are designed in a complex crystalline fashion. This can be interpreted as having detailed patterns or latticework, common in creative portrayals of crystal structures.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been simplified to a minimalist horizon with no visible islands or complex terrain, emphasizing the crystal ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall scene still includes visible islands and terrain, much like a natural maritime environment. This indicates that while the ship has been dramatically transformed, the background has not been altered to a minimalist level. Therefore, the background remains similar to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there strong visual contrast between the shimmering, iridescent crystal ship and the minimalist background, enhancing the perception of brilliance and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contrast is indeed strong as the ship's crystal form is highly reflective and iridescent, which stands out against the natural maritime background. The visual contrast enhances the shipâ€™s perception of brilliance, but the background is not minimalist, retaining its original complexity with visible islands.",
