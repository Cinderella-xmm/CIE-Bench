      "question": "Is the image now depicting a box-like structure instead of a wall clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a distinct box-like structure, characterized by its rectangular shape and a lid that opens to reveal contents, suggesting it is a box suitable for holding items like watches. This is visually and conceptually different from the structure of a wall clock, which is typically round, mounted on a wall, and displays time. The comparison confirms that Image B represents a box-like structure with a modern watch inside, unlike the wall-mounted clock in Image A.",
