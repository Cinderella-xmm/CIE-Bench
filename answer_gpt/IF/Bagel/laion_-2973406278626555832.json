    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image divided into two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can clearly observe two different sections that are delineated. The top part is composed of a couple of smaller scenes, and the bottom part features a large cross-section diagram. This division into sections visually suggests distinct panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vape device in Panel 1 rendered in a detailed and realistic manner, showing it in use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the vape device is drawn in a cartoon style rather than detailed and realistic. It is depicted being held and used, but the rendering is simplistic, characteristic of a comic strip rather than photorealistic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 include a text bubble with the exact phrase “This device vaporizes liquid at low temperatures.”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting the text in Panel 1 of Image B, the speech bubble does not contain the exact phrase. It contains a sentence with jumbled or incorrectly spelled words that convey a similar meaning, but it's not verbatim.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 have a background depicting a simplified laboratory setting that suggests innovation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 shows a minimalistic background with elements such as flasks or beakers, which imply a laboratory setting. The simplified nature of this background conveys a sense of innovation typically associated with scientific environments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Does Panel 2 display a cross-section diagram of the vape device with clear labels for coil, liquid, battery, and airflow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, a cross-section of the vape device is visible, however, it lacks clear and precise labels that specifically name the coil, liquid, battery, and airflow. The diagram appears more illustrative than descriptive.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does Panel 2 include a text box with the exact phrase “Understanding its internal magic!”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Panel 2 is intended to resemble the phrase mentioned, but it contains many misspellings and incorrect words. It is not the exact phrase 'Understanding its internal magic!'",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is all text in the comic strip rendered in a handwritten-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B appears to be rendered in a font style that mimics handwriting, which is typical for comic strips to give a casual and informal appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the vape device in the comic strip visually consistent with the one shown in the original image (black cap, transparent body, etc.)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the device in Image B to Image A, it can be seen that the vape device features a black cap and likely a transparent body, though the details are simplified due to the comic style representation. This indicates a basic visual consistency between the two representations.",
