    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a prominent wooden frame surrounds the entire scene, giving it the appearance of a diorama or a shadow box. This frame is visible as it creates a border around the three-dimensional elements inside. A shadow box serves to enclose and protect its contents while showcasing them like a display case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the tree been scaled down in size and rendered with enhanced 3D surface texture (e.g., visible bark details, depth, shading)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a small, almost toy-like tree within the shadow box frame. The tree has noticeable texture details on its bark and leaves that suggest a 3D rendering. This creates an enhanced depth and shading effect, making the tree appear tactile and realistic in texture despite its miniature size.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers (e.g., pink, yellow, blue, red) beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear clusters of multi-colored flowers on the ground. These patches contain pink, yellow, blue, and some other colors, making them distinct and visible beneath the tree, similar to decorative elements in a shadow box.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background consist of multiple layered painted surfaces that create a sense of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes layered elements such as clouds and hills. These are arranged in a way that gives the scene a sense of depth, typical of a diorama effect, where different layers of objects or painted surfaces are used to create a 3D illusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires above or within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows small, fluffy cloud shapes that appear to be hanging within the scene, and thin wires are visible, suggesting that these clouds are suspended to maintain their positions. This contributes to the three-dimensional structure of the display.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image include surreal or stylized elements (e.g., floating clouds, soft glow, pastel hues) that contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features whimsical elements such as floating cloud shapes suspended by wires, pastel color tones for the flowers and background, and a highly stylized, miniature tree. These elements combine to create a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere reminiscent of crafted artwork or miniature scenes.",
