      "question": "Is the image now an educational infographic with a clear title \"Currencies of the World\" displayed at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear title at the top that reads 'Curyrinues ofe World,' which is presumably intended to mean 'Currencies of the World.' This implies that the image is designed to function as an educational infographic related to world currencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the design use a clean, modern aesthetic with minimal visual clutter and balanced layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of Image B includes distinct sections with clear labels and visual elements that are cleanly laid out, including graphs and icons. The overall arrangement suggests an attempt at minimal clutter and a modern look, although the implementation could be improved for clarity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows three sections titled 'USD,' 'QUR,' and 'INR.' However, 'QUR' is likely intended to be 'QAR' for Qatari Riyal. Despite the typographical error, the content aims to represent currencies like the USD and INR, suggesting an attempt to correspond to visible banknotes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wallet is illustrated with clean, simple lines resembling a more schematic or cartoon style, but it is not a blueprint-style drawing. It maintains the idea of a modern aesthetic but doesn't fully adopt a blueprint approach.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature annotations directly next to each currency slot within a blueprint-style drawing that identifies or describes the currency. The image does include some general labels and sections for currencies, but these are not part of a blueprint or overly descriptive elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a graph that seems to depict exchange rate data, indicated by labeled axes and bar charts. This suggests that there is an element of data representation relevant to the currencies in question.",
