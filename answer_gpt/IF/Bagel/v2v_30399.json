      "question": "Have the giraffes' necks been exaggeratedly elongated in a whimsical caricature style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes' necks are depicted unnaturally long and with an exaggerated slenderness that deviates from their natural proportions. This is indicative of a caricature style, which often features exaggerated elements to create a whimsical or humorous effect. The visual exaggeration of the necks is a common technique used in caricature art to emphasize certain traits or create a distinct visual impression.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the giraffes' facial traits, such as eyes, ears, and ossicones, emphasized in a whimsical caricature style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes' facial features like the eyes, ears, and ossicones are drawn with prominent and exaggerated characteristics. The eyes appear larger and more expressive, a common trait in caricature to impart a whimsical personality. The ears and ossicones also have exaggerated shapes, which add to the whimsical effect. This portrayal diverges from the realistic depiction of these features and is aligned with a caricature style that emphasizes certain facial traits for comedic or artistic effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a plain white background with no details of the original environment elements such as trees, rocks, grass, or sky. This is a stark contrast to Image A where these features are clearly visible, forming a realistic natural setting. In the transition from a photographic image to a black-and-white illustrative style, the background has been completely removed, indicating significant alteration.",

      "question": "Do the overall proportions of the giraffes reflect a whimsical caricature style with exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall proportions of the giraffes, including their lanky legs and elongated necks, as well as their facial features, are rendered with exaggerated and whimsical traits typical of caricature. This style is characterized by such exaggerated proportions to enhance humor or create a distinctive artistic effect, deviating markedly from the realistic and proportionate depiction seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a simple white background, devoid of any additional elements or details beyond the giraffes themselves. No new elements have been introduced; rather, the existing background from Image A has been entirely removed. The transformation into a caricature style involved simplifying or omitting the background altogether rather than adding new elements.",
