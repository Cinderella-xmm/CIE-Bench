    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the individual's torso and attire rendered as an oversized figurine with exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso and attire clearly have a smooth, shiny surface characteristic of a stylized figure or figurine. The proportions, particularly the muscular build and oversized style, suggest a deliberate exaggeration common in figurines designed to emphasize certain characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figurine wear a stylized athletic jersey that differs from the original realistic shirt design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the attire with a glossy, plastic-like appearance and less realistic texture compared to Image A's more natural fabric. This stylized jersey fits the context of a figurine rather than functional athletic apparel one would wear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Craft\" logo visibly emphasized with increased size, brightness, or contrast compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Craft' logo is rendered with sharper definition and perhaps slightly exaggerated in contrast or size compared to Image A, suggesting emphasis typically seen in figurine or model representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the shirt material rendered with a matte-finished black polymer appearance, lacking shine or fabric-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glossy or polished finish on the shirt, not matte, indicative of polymer. This lacks the natural fabric texture seen in clothes. Since Image A presents a realistic fabric, this suggests a representation transformation in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the logo rendered in elevated, bold tones (e.g., bright red, white, blue) that contrast sharply with the black shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo in Image B uses bright, bold colors that contrast strongly against the shirt's black background, typical of enhanced coloring techniques in figurine styling, differing from the more subdued hues typical of realistic attire in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a detachable base beneath the figurine that resembles a sleek, contemporary stand made of polished metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an appearance of a base beneath the torso that looks like it could be a figurine stand. However, without visible details of material or finish, it's speculative to definitively assert a polished metal appearance solely based on the given image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the base exhibit a subtle reflection consistent with polished metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The provided view in Image B shows a shiny base, suggesting some reflective quality, possibly consistent with polished metal. However, as the assessment is of an unclear base structure without detailed reflection, it's not definitively reflective of polished metal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
