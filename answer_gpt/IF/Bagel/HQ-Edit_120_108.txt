    "Question": "Q1: Are cogs and gears visibly integrated into the armature of the brass lamp?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp's structure prominently incorporates cogs and gears, which are visually evident as part of its design. This gives the lamp a mechanical or steampunk aesthetic. These elements are crafted into the armature, which can be identified from circular and toothed patterns consistent with gear imagery. The addition of such components aligns with the common design choice in steampunk styles, where mechanical features are emphasized.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are rivet patterns present on the floral wallpaper?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a steampunk-inspired setting, but instead of floral wallpaper, rivet and gear patterns are present in the background. The visual cues show a texture with repeated circular and rivet-like symbols, which are characteristic of industrial design rather than floral motifs. The original floral elements have been replaced to suit the mechanical theme.",

    "explanation": "Image B predominantly uses warm colors such as brass, brown, and amber. These hues are commonly associated with vintage and steampunk styles, invoking a sense of aged metal and classical warmth. The lamp, gear elements, and background tones all contribute to this cohesive color palette, giving the image a vintage aesthetic consistent with leather-and-brass themes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the lamp still casting a focused beam of light directly onto the open book, maintaining the original lighting setup?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp continues to cast a direct beam of light onto the open book. This detail is preserved from Image A, where the lighting creates a spot-lit effect, maintaining focus on the book. Such lighting is typical in desk setups designed for reading or working, and despite the thematic changes and decorations, the fundamental lighting arrangement remains unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
