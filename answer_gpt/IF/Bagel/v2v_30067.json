      "question": "Have the visible cracks and broken areas on the clock tower been restored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible cracks and broken areas on the clock tower are significantly reduced compared to a typical worn-out appearance. This suggests that these areas have been smoothed out or filled in to create a more uniform surface. This observation leads to the conclusion that the restoration process has been applied to these areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any gaps or missing parts left unfilled on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, all the gaps or areas that would typically represent missing parts in a structure appear to be filled in or reconstructed, resulting in a continuous and complete appearance of the clock tower. This leads to the conclusion that there are no significant gaps or missing parts left unfilled after the restoration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the restored parts match the original texture and color of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the restored parts have a smoother texture and more uniform color compared to what would be expected in a weathered structure. This deviation from an original appearance, where texture and color might vary due to age and weathering, suggests that the restored parts do not closely match the original texture and color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the restored clock tower maintain the original architectural style and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the restoration, Image B retains the key architectural features and design of the clock tower, such as its shape, structural proportions, and details like arches. These consistent elements suggest that the overall architectural style and details have been preserved.",

      "question": "Is the clock face intact and legible after the restoration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face appears clear, intact, and the Roman numerals are legible. This suggests that the clock face itself has not been damaged and remains fully functional and readable after the restoration process.",
