      "question": "Is the Victorian Lady depicted in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Victorian Lady is represented in a style that appears to be a 3D cartoon or digital rendering. Characteristics such as rounded and simplified shapes, smooth surfaces, and vibrant colors typically indicate a cartoonish appearance. This 3D cartoon style is evident from the smoothness and lack of intricate detailing commonly associated with realistic depictions, thereby leading to the conclusion that the image is indeed in a 3D cartoon style.",

      "question": "Does the image feature soft lighting that balances a refined yet colorful personality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears bright but not overly exaggerated, characteristic of many cartoon renderings that aim for clarity and emphasis on the character. While it adds vibrancy and illuminates the character, it does not exhibit the subtlety and shading associated with 'soft lighting' that might convey a refined or colorful personality. Hence, while the lighting is clear and bright, it does not necessarily possess the nuanced refinement typically conveyed by soft lighting.",

      "question": "Are skill bars or attributes like [Grace +10, Etiquette +8] included on the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible presence of skill bars or attribute indicators such as [Grace +10, Etiquette +8]. The card features the character in the center, a blurred text at the top, and a name tag at the bottom, but no specific skill or attribute indicators are present.",

      "question": "Is there a title banner at the top and a name tag at the bottom of the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a card with a title banner at the top, displaying some text, and a name tag at the bottom with the text 'Dachiie'. This setup is a classic design for cards that feature a character or individual, providing both a title or title area at the top and a specific name at the bottom.",

      "question": "Does the background align with the Victorian era, featuring warm tones and complementary designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B uses sepia-like, warm tones, commonly associated with Victorian-style aesthetics. The patterns and colors complement the central figure well, maintaining a cohesive look. Such styling choices are reflective of the Victorian era's preference for rich, warm color schemes and elaborate, often symmetrical designs.",
