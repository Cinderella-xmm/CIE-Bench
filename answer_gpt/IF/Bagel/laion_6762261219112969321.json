      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the overall shape of the sofa been transformed into a fantastical cloud creature with plush, pillow-like formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a cloud creature composed of numerous round, fluffy pillowy formations that make up its body structure, suggesting a transformation from the original sofa shape. Such cloud formations are whimsical and differ significantly from the structured seating arrangement of a typical sofa seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the leather texture been replaced with soft, swirling cloud-like textures throughout the cushioned areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a texture that mimics soft, swirling clouds rather than the traditional leather texture seen in Image A. This indicates a change, as leather typically appears smooth and solid, contrasting with the fluffy and irregular cloud-like formations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the wooden legs and armrests been transformed into branching, wind-like structures that resemble gusts of air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of the wooden legs and armrests seen in Image A, there are branching structures that have a fluid, organic appearance reminiscent of tree branches or wind gusts, indicating a transformation into features that suggest motion or air currents.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there whimsical eyes visibly placed on the cushions of the cloud creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes noticeably whimsical, cartoonish eyes placed among the cloud formations, which add character to the cloud creature. These eyes differ from the plain surface seen in Image A, where the cushions lack any facial features.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flowing mist trail extending from the back of the cloud creature, giving the impression of ethereal flight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, does not depict any mist trail extending from the back of the creature. It primarily features a static cloud formation with whimsical elements. Image A is similarly devoid of any ethereal features like a mist trail.",
