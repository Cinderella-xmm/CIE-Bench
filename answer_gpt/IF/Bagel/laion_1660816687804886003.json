      "question": "Is the object now shaped like a modern energy drink can instead of a sneaker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object maintained its sneaker shape and structure, resembling a sneaker with laces, a sole, and a visible logo. It still has the typical features of athletic footwear, such as a tongue and a textured surface more aligned with a shoe than with a cylindrical can design. Therefore, it is not shaped like a can.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the can feature the navy blue mesh pattern from the original sneaker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the object still has the navy blue mesh pattern present in Image A, which is characteristic of the sneaker's design. Since the object has retained its footwear shape and texture, it still includes this mesh pattern and not the characteristics typical of a can.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo (circular emblem with red and blue sections) visible on the front of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular brand logo with red and blue sections is clearly displayed on the side of the object, similar to its placement on a sneaker. The logo remains prominent and unchanged in terms of style, indicating its continued presence on what remains a sneaker.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bold laces represented as embossed or raised textures wrapped around the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laces are visually similar to those in Image A, appearing as textured elements typical of a sneaker. They are not re-imagined as can designs, meaning they do not appear embossed or as a raised texture typically seen on can packaging.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the three navy blue stripes from the sole appear as a dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes are observed on the sole of the sneaker, consistent with the original design in Image A. They are not transitioned into a dynamic pattern typical for a drink can's design. The stripes are retained in their original context on the sneaker's sole.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" written in red lettering on the white upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon investigation of Image B, no such red lettering reading \"Kickstart\" appears on any part of the image. The sneaker maintains its original branding elements from Image A, which include different text and logos. The assumption of the text labeled \"Kickstart\" does not align with the available lettering and logos seen in the edited image.",
