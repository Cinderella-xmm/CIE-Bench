    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser is visibly constructed using LEGO bricks, which are identified by their interlocking nature. The primary colors observed in the image are brown, which mimics the wooden texture, and gold, which is likely used to mimic decorative metal parts, fitting the description given.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are decorative patterns on the front, but they are abstracted and simplified forms typical of what LEGO structures allow. They are not recreated with precision due to the limitations of using LEGO bricks, which do not capture intricate details well.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the curved sides and legs of the dresser constructed using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dresser with a blocky appearance due to the inherent nature of LEGO. While there may be an attempt to imply curves, the sides and legs do not use smoothly joined sloped bricks, as they still have a stepped appearance that's characteristic of LEGO brick construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the marble top been replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top surface of the structure appears to be represented by a flat surface made of LEGO bricks in a gray color, likely intended to mimic the original marble top from Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dresser placed on a neutral, plain background that does not distract from the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is plain and neutral, not exhibiting any distracting patterns or elements, allowing the focus to remain on the LEGO structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO dresser maintain the original two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs around each drawer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the dresser constructed with LEGO bricks but does not show the original two-drawer layout or ornate frame designs around drawers. Instead, it features a simplified version because of the limitations and nature of LEGO construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all surfaces of the dresser visibly composed of LEGO bricks, with no realistic wood or metal textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the dresser consists entirely of LEGO bricks, which inherently do not feature realistic textures like wood grain or metal. The surfaces are clearly constructed of the uniform and blocky LEGO parts.",
