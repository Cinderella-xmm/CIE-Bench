      "question": "Does the motorcycle and truck appear in a simplified, cartoon-like version with a cute aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues suggest a simplified and stylized approach. The shapes are basic, with soft, rounded edges, and the overall design evokes a sense of cuteness. For example, the truck and motorcycle have more rounded forms with less intricate detail, which aligns with a cartoon-like, aesthetic. This type of representation is often used to create a cute or chibi effect.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a red motorcycle, a rider in black attire, and a blue truck, mirroring Image A's color and object setup.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stylized elements, with the vehicles and the rider exhibiting exaggerated, simplistic proportions central to a cartoonish style. The motorcycle and truck's basic form with smoother lines, and the rider's oversized helmet and body proportions create an expressive, playful impression.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no indication of a flat color circular base or any extension of elements beyond such a base. The design follows a cohesive shape without a distinguishing circular foundation or dynamic extensions beyond a base.",
