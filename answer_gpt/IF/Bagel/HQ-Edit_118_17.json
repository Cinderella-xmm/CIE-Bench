    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stave church enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible structural framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stave church is contained within a transparent case with visible edges, typical of a display case. These boundaries frame the church model and suggest an intentional display setting, consistent with the criteria of a display case.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple layers of soft, wispy clouds visible in the background panel behind the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a backdrop with tiers of soft, rounded cloud shapes behind the stave church within the display case. The depiction of these clouds, their form, and how they are presented in the case indicate intentional layering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are small-scale coniferous trees positioned around the base of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are models of coniferous trees positioned in the display within Image B. These are small, consistent with the miniaturized model church and typical of scaled representations of natural elements for such displays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountains in the background feature a desaturated, low-contrast color palette consistent with a muted tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature mountain backgrounds; instead, it has artificial clouds and a simple backdrop within the display case. There's no use of a muted mountain color palette in the display.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there sculpted rocky terrain forming a border around the base of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground around the stave church within the display case appears to have a crafted rocky terrain. This simulates a natural environment border typical for such display models.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a model church surrounded by artificial snow, with a path featuring small footprint impressions leading to the entrance. This detail is visible and suggests simulation of environmental interaction with the church.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the stave church retain its original architectural details such as carved wooden elements, multiple gables, and dragon-shaped roof ornaments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replicates the stave church with distinctive elements like gables and dragon-shaped ornaments typical of such architecture, preserved in its model form. These architectural features are central to the church's style.",
