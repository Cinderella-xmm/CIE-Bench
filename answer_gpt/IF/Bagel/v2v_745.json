      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the backgrounds of all stickers transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers are presented in a format where the background is largely not visible due to the presence of a consistent white border surrounding each character. This suggests that the stickers themselves have a defined shape and the use of the white border typically indicates they are not on a transparent background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stickers arranged in a 3x3 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the stickers are clearly placed in a 3x3 grid formation as there are three rows and three columns of stickers. This is visually apparent by counting and noting the consistent alignment and spacing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all stickers have a square 1:1 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers feature varying outlines corresponding to the characters they depict, which include white borders. Given the variety in the character shapes, sizes, and actions, it is unlikely that all stickers strictly adhere to a square 1:1 aspect ratio.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all stickers uniformly depict a Chibi-style aesthetic reminiscent of Ghibli with lively and bold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters have exaggerated proportions typical of the Chibi style, characterized by large heads and small bodies, but the colors, while vibrant, are not necessarily lively or bold as associated with Ghibli's style. The interpretation is subjective, but the resemblance lacks in vibrancy akin to Ghibli.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each sticker portray a distinct travel-related action, emotion, or theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the blurring, visual cues such as maps, gestures, and expressions suggest various travel-related actions and emotions. Each character is holding or interacting with a travel-related item or showing expressions related to travel, as depicted through pose and minimal visible elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all characters in the stickers fully depicted without any missing features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker includes a complete portrayal of the Chibi character, with all necessary elements like limbs, clothing, and accessories correctly depicted, despite the blurring concealing facial details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a consistent white border around each sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker has a clear and uniform white border which separates the design from the background, providing a consistent look across all nine stickers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there any disconnected or unrelated elements within the stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "There are no observable disconnected or unrelated elements within each individual sticker. The blurring only affects the facial areas, while all other visible components remain coherent and related to the depicted character and theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q9",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "There is no visible text present in the stickers. The focus is on the characters and their actions, and absence of text means there's nothing to evaluate for accuracy.",
