    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image show the stapler from both the front and rear views side by side?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows two staplers positioned side by side. Both are facing the same way, showing only the front view for each, with no indication of a rear view presented. Without any views from the rear, the answer is clear.",

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stapler's front and rear views arranged next to each other in a horizontal alignment?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, both staplers are shown from the front view, aligned horizontally, side by side. There is no presentation of a rear view, only two identical front views side by side.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are all parts of the stapler visible in both the front and rear views without any truncation?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows two identical staplers from the front view, where both are fully visible from their presented angle. However, there is no rear view displayed, hence the question of visibility without truncation for a rear view does not apply.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the front and rear views of the stapler in the edited image match in terms of color and design details?",
    "explanation": "Both staplers in the edited image are identical, suggesting a match in terms of color and design from the shown front views. However, since there's no rear view, this comparison isn't applicable in this context.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background consistent between the front and rear views of the stapler without additional elements introduced?",
    "explanation": "The background in the edited image remains consistent, as a green backdrop is observed with the two side-by-side front views of staplers. No additional elements or differences in the background are introduced.",
