      "question": "Has the entire image been rendered in sepia tones consistent with a vintage postcard aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is predominantly presented in sepia tones, a common coloring style used in vintage photography and postcards, characterized by brown hues that give an aged or antique look. This choice of color palette is evident through the uniform brownish tint across all components of the image.",

      "question": "Does the violinist's dress feature visible floral engravings across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress has visible floral engravings along with musical notes across its surface. These engravings are not present in Image A, where the dress is plain. The floral patterns along with musical notes stand out distinctly against the sepia toned background.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the view through the window been replaced with an abstract painted landscape composed of swirling patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Notably, in Image B, the natural view seen through the window in Image A has been replaced by an abstract painting-like landscape. The swirly patterns are characterized by flowing lines and differing shades, which deviate significantly from the realistic depiction of nature visible in the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible gold inlays on the violinâ€™s body, neck, or scroll?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin does not show any visible gold inlays on any part of its structure. The sepia tone rendering uniformizes the appearance of the violin, which does not suggest the presence of any gold-like detailing or embellishments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a decorative border around the image that is created with a handwritten music score. The musical notes form a pattern that acts as an artistic frame for the entire image, a feature absent from Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
