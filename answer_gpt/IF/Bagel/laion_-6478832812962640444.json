      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the boot transformed into a sculpture-like object with a rigid, stylized structure consistent with Art Deco aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot exhibits a rigid, geometric structure with smooth, sharp lines. The design elements like the angular patterns and the reflective surfaces are typical of Art Deco style, known for its bold geometric shapes and lavish ornamentation. The boot has lost any hint of its original flexible, wearable form, which aligns with being described as sculptural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embroidered floral patterns replaced with geometric designs such as zigzags, chevrons, or sunburst motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a boot with geometric patterns instead of any floral designs. The patterns consist of clean, sharp lines forming zigzags and angles, reflective of Art Deco motifs, which are often characterized by such geometric forms. These designs replace any organic or floral themes seen in the original boot, which fits this description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative elements on the boot have a metallic sheen and appear as inlaid metal plates or strips rather than stitched leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B has a high-gloss, metallic look, with defined sections resembling inlaid metal plates rather than any stitched or embossed leather. The reflective, metallic quality seen here suggests metal rather than any traditional leather craft techniques.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the heel been redesigned into a stepped, multi-tiered architectural shape with sharp angles and vertical emphasis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heel is reimagined with a more angular, block-like structure. It includes multiple layers or tiers, as seen from the sharp lines and facets, matching the architectural language of Art Deco designs where sharp angles and vertical lines are emphasized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot surface exhibit a hard, reflective, non-leather-like finish consistent with metal or polished stone, indicating a sculptural material change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bootâ€™s surface in Image B is shiny and reflective, very much like metal or polished stone, rather than leather, which usually has a matte, textured surface. This reflective quality and the sculptural transformations further indicate a change to a material that behaves more like metal or stone.",
