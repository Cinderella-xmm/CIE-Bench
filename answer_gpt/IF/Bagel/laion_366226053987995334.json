      "question": "Are both feather earrings depicted with expressive facial features such as eyes and mouths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a cartoonish character that resembles a feather with expressive facial features, including large eyes and a mouth. This indicates anthropomorphism where an inanimate object is given human-like features. Thus, at least one feather earring has these features, but it is not clear if both earrings are depicted like this, as the image focuses on one prominent character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish feather character is interacting with a human-like character, and there is no indication or visual element of one feather pulling another along a path. The interaction seems more direct without any emphasis on pulling or trailing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a speech bubble present but it contains a different text: “LET'S SOOR NEW NEW HDETOA!!”. The text is similar in context to the given phrase but does not match exactly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features characters with bold outlines and utilizes vibrant colors, such as the bright yellow of the feather character and the blue of the human-like character's hair. This indicates a cartoon style with clearly defined elements and vibrant coloring.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no clear indication of a comic-style panel or border in Image B. Additionally, there are no visible background elements like wind or paths. The image focuses on the characters and speech bubble without additional panel features.",
