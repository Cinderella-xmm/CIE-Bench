      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it is evident that the entire scene, including the ballerina figure and Eiffel Tower structures, is encapsulated within a transparent, spherical object reminiscent of a snow globe. The curved boundary typical of snow globes is apparent, indicating that the scene is enclosed within it.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe that replicates the leaping pose of the original dancer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a 3D figure of a ballerina inside the snow globe. This figure is standing on one leg with arms raised, which is a common pose for a ballerina, but it does not replicate the leaping pose seen in Image A, where the dancer is in mid-air with both legs extended. Therefore, the ballerina's pose does not match the original dancer's leaping pose.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and at least two other recognizable miniature Parisian landmarks present inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two miniature Eiffel Towers placed inside the snow globe. However, there are no additional recognizable miniature Parisian landmarks visible besides the Eiffel Towers. Therefore, the presence of the Eiffel Tower and other miniatures does not meet the condition of having at least two other landmarks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible white flakes scattered around the Eiffel Tower inside the snow globe. These flakes have a distinct shape and appearance of snowflakes, fitting the typical design of a snow globe, which often includes swirling snowflakes around its contents.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe resting on a base that appears to be made of a material resembling bronze, given its color and sheen. The base has visible engravings in a script that appears to be French, indicating that the base is both bronze-like and engraved with French.",
