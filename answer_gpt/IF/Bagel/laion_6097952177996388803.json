      "question": "Does the edited image depict the mountain range as a mythical beast with identifiable features such as a head, body, or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a clear depiction of a mythical beast featuring identifiable elements such as a head with horns, eyes, and a distinctive texture that mimics biological features like skin or fur. This artistic rendition transforms the natural landscape into a creature, indicating an intended transformation from a geographical form to a mythical creature. This conclusion is drawn from the elaborate depiction of facial features and the beast-like posture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the two highest peaks appear as large, curved, horn-like structures emerging from the top of the mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the peaks have been artistically transformed to resemble large, horn-like structures. These peak formations mimic curved horns, enhancing the beast-like appearance of the landscape by visually integrating such elements typically associated with horned mythical creatures. This transformation uses common visual mythology symbols to create the illusion of horns.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky surfaces of the mountains visibly altered to resemble a textured hide, such as scaly or rugged skin-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface textures in the edited image exhibit features reminiscent of a hide rather than natural rock formations. This includes ruggedness and texturing that align with common depictions of mythical creatures possessing scaly or textured skins. The edited image reflects this by altering the surface appearance, suggesting a creature's hide.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible mossy patterns and root-like structures along the mountain slopes that resemble tangled fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image showcases detailed mossy patterns that cover the slopes, visually suggesting tangled fur. The inclusion of root-like structures supports this interpretation, as they enhance the semblance to fur due to their arrangement and texture, akin to how long fur might cover an animal.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the valleys been transformed into sinewy, muscular structures that follow the natural contours of the land but resemble biological musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image focuses on the mythical creature's head and upper body, foregoing alterations across the valleys into sinewy or muscular structures and primarily retaining the 'beast' themed focus in the highlighted facial and horn structures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not show any enhanced or altered ambiance such as lighting effects, warm tones, or mist designed to convey a natural aura. The focus remains on the physical transformation and texture rather than atmospheric modifications.",
