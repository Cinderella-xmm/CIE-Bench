      "question": "Are the bookshelf and books fully constructed from LEGO bricks instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a structure made entirely out of LEGO bricks in various shades, primarily browns and beige, with a small portion in navy blue. The surface of these bricks is smooth and follows the typical appearance of LEGO bricks, which contrasts with the original wooden bookshelf and books seen in Image A. The visual cues indicate that the structure in Image B does not resemble wood but rather the plastic-like surface characteristic of LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all books represented as individual LEGO blocks in earthy tones (e.g., brown, tan, terracotta)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO structure appears to be a single entity rather than a collection of individual blocks representing books. The colors used are earthy (browns, beige) but the design doesn't specifically indicate individual books separated into singular LEGO blocks. In contrast, Image A depicts a clear separation of books on a shelf. Hence, the representation in Image B does not match individual book blocks but rather a unified tower.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the intricate carvings on the original shelf and book spines replicated using darker LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO structure in Image B is primarily constructed out of basic LEGO blocks without any intricate detailing or carvings typically found in woodwork as seen in Image A. The darker bricks in Image B do not convey any replicative or intricate carving features present on the book spines or shelf in Image A. This contrast highlights the absence of carvings in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the LEGO tower narrow progressively toward the top, forming a tapered shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a LEGO structure that indeed narrows as it reaches the top, forming a tapered shape. This observation is drawn from the arrangement of the bricks, where the base of the tower is wider and progressively narrows upward. The conclusion is based solely on the visual analysis of Image B without comparison at this step.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO structure smooth and plastic-like, lacking any wood grain or natural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues from Image B show a structure made from LEGO bricks, which exhibit a smooth and uniform surface typical of plastic materials. This appearance lacks any wood grain or natural textures that would be present in wooden objects, aligning with common characteristics known for LEGO bricks. Image A, in comparison, has the appearance of wood with grain textures and intricate carving.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background plain and muted, without any patterns or textures, to highlight the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a plain and muted background devoid of patterns or textures, aligning with the choice to emphasize the LEGO structure in the foreground. This plainness contrasts with Image A, where the detailed wall pattern complements the wooden bookshelf. The muted, texture-free background in Image B allows the LEGO model to stand out.",
