      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sailboat rendered entirely as a carved walnut wood sculpture, with no metallic, fabric, or realistic marine materials visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sailboat is represented as a sculpture made entirely from wood, specifically featuring the appearance of walnut wood, which is suggested by its color and grain patterns. There are no hints of metallic, fabric, or other non-wood materials. This conclusion arises from recognizing the carving style and common characteristics of wooden sculptures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails made of smooth, polished walnut wood featuring visible and intricate grain patterns, rather than fabric or translucent material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B visually present smooth and polished surfaces with visible grain patterns suggestive of wood, specifically walnut, rather than fabric or any translucent material. This is determined by focusing on the texture and finish, characteristic of finely crafted wooden sculptures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hull of the sculpture feature deep, textured carvings that clearly mimic the appearance of wooden planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the sculpture in Image B displays pronounced carvings that resemble wooden planks, typical of a wooden sculpture crafted to imitate a boat's construction. The overlapping and textural detail contribute to this interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that elevates it above the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wooden sculpture positioned atop a pale beige pedestal, which is visually distinct and serves to elevate the sculpture. This setup is common for displaying art pieces, differentiating from any natural setting like a water surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the natural wood tones and detailed craftsmanship of the walnut sculpture clearly stand out against the background, without being obscured by similar colors or excessive brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Against the neutral background in Image B, the sculpture's warm walnut tones and detailed craftsmanship are quite prominent, with no interference from similar colors or overly bright lighting. This contrast allows the intricate features of the sculpture to be fully appreciated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water consistent with the wooden sculpture, showing the carved hull and walnut sails, rather than a realistic boat reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment is not conducive to creating a traditional reflection seen on water, as the sculpture is on a pedestal. The conceptual comparison involves recognizing that the reflection would theoretically match the sculpture's characteristics if it were in such a setting. However, the query pertains to a hypothetical reflection scenario rather than the actual image content.",
