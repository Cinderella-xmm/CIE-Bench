      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the oatmeal blend is depicted with basic visual elements, including oats in a bowl. The scene is playful and chibi-style, which typically conveys cuteness rather than a regal aura. The person depicted is in chibi form, holding a bowl of oatmeal, wearing a simple miniature crown. Thus, the oatmeal blend itself does not reflect a refined, regal appearance.",
