      "question": "Have the three sheep been transformed into chibi-style sticker characters while maintaining their original pose near the fence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four chibi-style characters resembling small animals, likely intended to represent the sheep from Image A. The original pose of the sheep near a fence is captured in these characters; however, there are four in the cartoon version as opposed to three sheep in the original. The presence of an additional character in Image B means the exact pose isn't maintained in terms of number. Consequently, the representation has some deviation from the original scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three chibi-style sheep equipped with the specified unique accessories: one with a red scarf, one with a knit hat, and one with a small bell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters are indeed depicted with accessories: two characters have red accessories resembling scarves or hats, and at least one features a small bell. However, there are four instead of three characters, and it's not definitively clear if all accessories are correctly unique per character. Therefore, the criteria are not fully met as specified.",

      "question": "Do the chibi-style sheep feature thick white outlines and flat cartoon line-art coloring as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B are presented in a simplified cartoon style, typical of chibi characters, with thick white outlines surrounding them and flat colors without noticeable shading or gradients. This matches the description of having thick outlines and flat cartoon line-art coloring.",

    {

      "question": "Is the background of the edited image transparent, making it suitable for use as a journaling sticker or IM emoji?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is a light solid color rather than transparent, which suggests that it may not directly meet the criteria for having a transparent background needed for stickers or emojis effectively.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite inconsistencies like the number of characters and the lack of a transparent background, the overall style of Image B resembles a typical cartoon sticker with a cute, simplistic design suitable for informal communication such as journaling or messaging, fulfilling an aspect of the intended function.",
