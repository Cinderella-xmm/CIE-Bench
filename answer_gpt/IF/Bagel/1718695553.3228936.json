      "question": "Is the background of the image now a flat white studio background instead of a sandy beach?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain, featureless white that is typical of a studio backdrop, contrasting with the natural textures and gradient colors of a sandy beach seen in Image A. This change to a simple white background is commonly used for product photography to emphasize the subject.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, by closely examining the plush hippo's features, there is a lack of any tags or branding on its ear. Standard plush design sometimes includes tags on ears, but in this case, no visible tag can be found.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a circular embroidered patch on the hippo's side with branding elements. This identification mark is absent in Image A, suggesting an addition in Image B for branding purposes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the plush hippo in tiger stripes and the knitted beach ball still present and clearly visible as the main subjects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main subject is a plush, tiger-striped hippo without the presence of a knitted beach ball which was apparent in Image A. The subject focus has shifted to just the plush toy due to image editing.",
