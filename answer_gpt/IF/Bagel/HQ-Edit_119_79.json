      "question": "Is the entire cat composed of crystal materials with no visible fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat appears to be made entirely of crystal materials, characterized by its faceted edges and transparent appearance. There is no indication of fur; the entire figure demonstrates the reflective and translucent properties typical of crystals. By combining world knowledge about crystal art and evaluating Image B's attributes, it's reasonable to conclude that the cat figure is composed solely of crystal materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body parts of the cat constructed primarily from clear and smoky quartz crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat constructed with clear crystalline materials combined with darker accents. These visual cues align with the appearance of clear and smoky quartz, which are often used in crystal figurines for their transparent and varied coloring properties. Thus, based on the appearance and common use of these types of crystals, it appears that the cat's body is made from clear and smoky quartz crystals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are brown and black obsidian accents used to represent the calico pattern on the cat’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the darker patches on the cat appear as deep shades, resembling the colors typical of obsidian, which is known for its rich black and brown hues. The pattern mimics the distribution of colors in a calico cat effectively. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of obsidian properties, it is likely that obsidian accents are used for this purpose.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cat’s eyes crafted from vibrant green emerald crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B has strikingly green eyes that resemble the color and appearance of emeralds, known for their vivid green shade. The crystal-like effects visible in the eye region further support the conclusion that emerald crystals were used for the cat's eyes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cat seated on a plain, polished wooden block with no added decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base visible in Image B is a simple, smooth, cylindrical piece of wood. Its plain appearance and evident polish indicate it is unadorned. There are no visible decorations other than the natural grain of the wood, emphasizing its simplicity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the wooden block appear natural and polished, providing a clear contrast to the crystalline cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden block has a smooth, polished finish, appearing natural in color, which contrasts with the brightness and facet-rich texture of the crystalline cat. This difference in texture and material between the wooden base and the crystal cat creates a noticeable contrast. Thus, the block does appear natural and polished.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the cat maintained its original seated posture with paws forward and tail curved behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the cat in Image B indicates it remains seated with its body upright. The positioning of the paws in front is evident, and the tail curves around behind. This positioning closely mirrors the typical seated position seen in many cat depictions, including Image A. Thus, the original posture appears to be maintained.",
