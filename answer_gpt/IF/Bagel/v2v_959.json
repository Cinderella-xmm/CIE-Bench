        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a three-panel comic strip style, styled as a cute, anime girl. The moe-style is evident through the exaggerated eyes, rounded face, and the overall design typical of such genres. Although the character's cute and exaggerated features differ from realistic proportions, the outfit's components remain similar to the original: red ski outfit, black helmet, and backpack. This suggests transformation into a moe-style anime character while preserving the original attire and style.",
