      "question": "Has the person's pose and expression been simplified into a cartoon line-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted as a cartoon line-art style, indicating a significant shift from a realistic to a minimalistic representation. The features such as the lines, outlines, and simplified shapes common in cartoon illustrations are visible. Judging by the use of simple black outlines and reduced detail, the person's depiction in Image B is indeed in a cartoon line-art style, confirming the simplification.",

      "question": "Is the raised hand still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual's raised hand is clearly visible in the cartoon line-art style. This hand gesture appears similarly to the pose in Image A, albeit in a more simplified form without detailed fingers or shading. The retention of this hand gesture in a prominent, albeit simplified manner, indicates that the raised hand is indeed still present in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cartoon-style person retain an open mouth expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a cartoon depiction where the person appears to have their mouth open. This is evident from the simple line-art style that depicts a mouth opening, following the typical cartoon narrative for an expressive or talkative character. The representation of an open mouth aligns with typical cartoon-style expressions, thereby confirming it was retained.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cartoon-style image include a camera covering part of the person's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a camera is visibly drawn in the cartoon line-art style placed at the position where it partially covers the person's face, similar in coverage to Image A. This representation is a clear indicator of the retention of this element. Matching the positioning from Image A, the camera maintains its placement and interaction with the person's face in simplified form, affirming continuity in representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble with the text “Take a photo” in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a speech bubble containing the text 'Take a photo' above the cartoon person. This added element, typical of a cartoon to communicate dialogue or expression, was not present in Image A. As it is distinctively introduced in Image B, its presence enriches the image's narrative structure by textual implication.",
