      "question": "Is the figurine made of a glossy, smooth ceramic material instead of knitted yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine clearly displays a glossy finish, indicative of ceramic materials, and reflects light on its surface, showcasing smoothness and shine. This contrasts with the knitted appearance in Image A, where the surface consists of visible yarn stitches. The additional reflection and absence of knitted texture in Image B suggest it's made of ceramic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figurine's color a vibrant terracotta tone (a rich reddish-brown)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B exhibits a warm, earthy hue that is characteristic of terracotta, which is a rich reddish-brown color. This is different from the pale, neutral color seen in Image A's knitted figure, indicating a color change to a terracotta tone for the ceramic figurine.",

      "question": "Are there visible intricate floral engravings on the surface of the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the surface of the ceramic figurine is adorned with detailed floral engravings, adding decorative elements. These are missing from Image A, where the knitted texture does not feature any engravings or patterns. The presence of these engravings in Image B is evident and constitutes a noticeable aspect of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the eyes resemble small polished amber stones in color, texture, and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the figurine have a glossy, translucent quality with a warm, amber color, closely resembling polished stones. This is different from Image A, where the eyes appear as simple, opaque black buttons. The polished appearance in Image B suggests an intentional design choice to mimic amber stones.",

      "question": "Is the figurine placed on a simple wooden tabletop with a minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine set on a clean, unadorned wooden surface, consistent with a minimalist style. The background is plain and neutral, supporting the minimalist presentation. In contrast, Image A does not provide such context, focusing entirely on the figurine itself with a hand holding it. The simplicity of the setting in Image B is thus evident.",
