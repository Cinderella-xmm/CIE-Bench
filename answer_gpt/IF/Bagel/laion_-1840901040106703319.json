      "question": "Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a structure characterized by geometric, faceted surfaces is visible, which suggests a crystal-like appearance. This differs significantly from a traditional log cabin, which is generally constructed with wooden logs. By observing these visual cues in Image B and using the knowledge that crystal structures often appear geometric with clear surfaces, it is reasonable to conclude that the original log cabin has been replaced by such a crystal structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is depicted with surfaces that are transparent and faceted, giving it a crystalline appearance. There are visible reflections and refractions of blue and green hues. This visual evidence aligns with the properties of transparent materials, such as glass or crystal, which can reflect and refract light in different colors.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure where the supports and edges appear as crystal, characterized by meticulously cut multifaceted surfaces. In comparison to Image A, where wooden beams are prominent, Image B lacks these wooden elements, suggesting they have been replaced with the crystal structure that is seen.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the crystal structure, there is a visible platform that appears smooth and has a white marble appearance. This type of surface is consistent with characteristics of marble, such as a polished and reflective look, indicating the platform is likely made of white marble.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small crystal formations present as decorative accents along the base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the base of the main crystal structure surrounded by smaller crystal formations. These formations appear as decorative accents, adding to the aesthetic appeal of the crystal arrangement. The presence of these elements aligns with the use of decorative crystals in various artistic and architectural designs.",
