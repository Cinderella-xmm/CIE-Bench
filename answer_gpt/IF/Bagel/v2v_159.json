      "question": "Have the shoes been increased in size while keeping their original design intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear more prominent and exaggerated in comparison to typical proportions, which implies an increase in size when observed through the cartoon or animation-style lens. However, the design details such as the color scheme and general shape seem to be preserved from a cursory visual analysis, suggesting that while the shoes have been exaggerated in size, the original design is largely intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the legs appear more cartoon-like compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs have a smoother, more rounded, and simplified appearance common in cartoon renderings, lacking realistic detail and showcasing exaggerated folds and smooth gradients typical of animated styles. In comparison, Image A has more realistic shading and texture consistent with a more artistic or realistic portrayal. The cartoon-like aspect in Image B is clear in its more stylized depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the feet placed on a shelf shaped like clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet stand on what appears to be cloud-like structures, but these are more solid and spherical rather like stylized puff clouds, which could be interpreted as resembling a 'shelf-like' appearance due to their solidity and layered configuration. However, with the cloud theme in mind, this interpretation aligns less with a literal shelf and more with stylized clouds.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall appearance of the legs and shoes reflect a bobblehead-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characteristics of the legs and shoes, such as their exaggerated size and whimsical design, resonate with the simplification and exaggeration found in bobblehead art. They appear larger and more pronounced compared to natural proportionality, which is consistent with bobblehead style attributes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shoes still maintain their original design details after being resized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the increase in size and cartoon-like transformation, the shoes continue to hold onto significant design elements such as the color pattern, panel layout, and lace style observed in Image A. These design consistencies suggest that the resizing did not fundamentally alter the identifying details of the shoes' design.",
