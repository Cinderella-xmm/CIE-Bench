    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original scanner completely replaced by a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual features indicate a box-shaped packaging design that prominently displays an illustration of a scanner. This contrasts with Image A, which clearly shows an actual physical scanner. Image B does not contain the original scanner itself, suggesting that a packaging design has overtaken the visual space.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the packaging feature visible metallic textures such as brushed metal, chrome, or reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a colorful, gradient-like design on the packaging, but there is no indication of metallic textures such as brushed metal, chrome, or reflective surfaces. The design leans more towards a digital, holographic theme rather than a metallic finish.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging exhibit an iridescent color effect with shifting hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a design that has a gradient effect with various transitioning hues, suggesting an iridescent color effect. This is reminiscent of the shifting colors seen on surfaces that have an iridescent quality.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a holographic display on the front of the packaging showing the scanner in operation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a depiction of the scanner on the packaging, showing a central screen with graphic elements that resemble holographic imagery. This screen displays effects that imply operation or digital activity, consistent with a holographic display.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has design elements that include grid lines and rectilinear patterns, which mimic the appearance of circuitry and data flow. These are visually themed elements consistent with technological or digital motifs.",
