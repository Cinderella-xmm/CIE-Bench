      "question": "Is the couple depicted in a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple is illustrated with cartoon-like features characterized by smooth outlines and minimal detail, indicating a semi-cartoon style. These features represent a simplification in contrast to a realistic depiction, as indicated by the stylized, bold lines and lack of intricate detail typical of a cartoon rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the man's tuxedo and the woman’s fur jacket visibly exaggerated in size or shape compared to their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's tuxedo and the woman’s fur jacket are represented in a flat, stylized manner. This stylization may give an impression of exaggeration due to the lack of depth and shading, but the general size and shape appear consistent with reality. Comparing with Image A, the style alters perception rather than altering physical proportions",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of simplified linear representations of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 emblem rather than the original photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B does not include the detailed elements typical of the original photograph from Image A. Instead, it features simplified patterns and designs reminiscent of background graphics in stylized art, which suggests an abstract interpretation rather than a literal photographic one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image feature a gold-colored, ribbon-like decorative border framing the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to contain a decorative border around the central motif resembling a stamp outline. The description specifies this border as gold-colored and ribbon-like which is inconsistent with the visual evidence, as the actual border seen is the scalloped edge customary in stamp designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stamp presented on a blue envelope that has a subtle embossed pattern of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stamp is placed on a blue background that appears to have a pattern resembling intricate designs, suggesting a textured surface. This implies a more artistic rendition rather than featuring explicit embossed logos, focusing on an overall aesthetic without corporate branding.",
