      "question": "Does the entire image show characteristics of Ukiyo-e style, with flat colors and clear lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of flat colors and distinct lines is evident throughout, which are characteristic features of the Ukiyo-e style. Ukiyo-e is known for its simplicity and decorative approach, often depicting nature and everyday life with clearly defined shapes and limited shading. The image shows stylized representation with a more abstract and flattened depiction of subjects, aligning with this aesthetic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball bats and grass do not exhibit traditional Japanese brush strokes typically seen in paintings. Instead, they are depicted in solid, flat colors and clear lines without the intricate, textured brushwork associated with traditional Japanese painting techniques. This aligns with Ukiyo-e's use of defined shapes rather than brush strokes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing to Image A, Image B has preserved the basic shapes of the baseball bats and grass, even though it has adapted them into the Ukiyo-e style. The overall forms and proportions remain intact, showing that while the style has changed, the fundamental shapes have been retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass is depicted using the flat colors and clear outlines of the Ukiyo-e style. There is no evidence of textured or layered brush strokes specific to traditional Japanese painting techniques. This approach is consistent with Ukiyo-e, which emphasizes outlines and solid colors rather than detailed brush strokes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball bats exhibit flat coloration and clear outlines typical of the Ukiyo-e style, without traditional Japanese brush strokes. The representation focuses more on the characteristic simplicity and cleanliness of lines associated with Ukiyo-e art, rather than textured or detailed brushwork.",
