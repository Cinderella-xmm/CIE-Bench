      "question": "Is the title 'The Evolution of Strength through Time' present and clearly visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the title at the top reads 'THE EVLLITIOTON OF STREGHTROUH TIME', which is a distorted version of 'The Evolution of Strength through Time'. Therefore, the title is not present clearly, as there are spelling errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there three distinct representations of the character corresponding to Antiquity, Feudal Era, and Modern Era?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows six characters with different attires, which suggest representations from various time periods. However, the caption in the image and the attire do not distinctly denote the clear distinction and labeling between Antiquity, Feudal Era, and Modern Era for three specific characters.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Among the characters depicted, those that might represent Antiquity seem to wear armor inspired by historical or mythological designs like those worn by Greek warriors. However, the visual distinction and confirmation are not definitive due to the styling and presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters depicted in the image are all wearing some form of armor instead of modern athletic gear, and none is specifically shown in a weightlifting pose with a barbell across the shoulders.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters' heads have a blurred effect, making it impossible to verify if facial features and expressions are identical across the depictions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the attire and posture in each era depicted with sufficient detail to distinguish them as representative of their respective time periods?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire and posture in the image suggest influences from historical time periods, such as armor consistent with ancient or medieval times, but they are not distinct enough to easily differentiate and confirm specific historical periods due to the lack of clarity in depiction and the mix of historical and anachronistic elements.",
