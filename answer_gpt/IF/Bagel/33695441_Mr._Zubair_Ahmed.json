      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows a structure resembling a serpent, complete with a dragon-like head and a coiled body. The staircase's spiral form has been artistically transformed into a creature, showcasing elements like a mouth and scales usually associated with reptiles or mythical creatures, which is a departure from a standard architectural structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the visual texture of the steps looks like segments resembling reptilian scales. These segments are visually similar to how scales are often depicted on snake or lizard skins. This transformation enhances the idea of the architectural structure being represented as a living creature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the creature's body shows segmented and reptilian texture, the edited image doesn't specifically depict a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments as the staircase follows the spiral path. The railing's transformation into such structure isn't visually evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not display wooden patterns. Instead, the serpent's body is covered in scales with a clear resemblance to reptilian skin, rather than a skeletally structured framework with wooden textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does portray the serpent's scales as having a textured look, resembling raised, stone-like ridges, which supports the organic and rugged impression intended by the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the staircase spiral transformed into the graceful, continuous coils of the serpent, expertly following the natural curve and form of a coiled-up reptilian creature, which aligns with its artistic theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent creature exhibit visual traits suggesting antiquity and natural grandeur (such as weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors used in the edited image are earthy and the serpent's features exhibit a weathered texture and organic form, which are traits commonly associated with antiquity and natural grandeur. These elements contribute to giving the serpent a timeless and majestic appearance.",
