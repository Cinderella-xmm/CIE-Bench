      "question": "Has the subject been transformed into a kawaii enamel pin style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a simplified design with bold outlines recognizable as a kawaii enamel pin. This type of style often involves cartoon-like characters depicted in a cute, exaggerated manner, with thick outlines and a shiny appearance typical of enamel pins. Based on these observations, the subject appears to be transformed into a kawaii enamel pin style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there glossy metal outlines present on the pin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the design appear prominent and bold, indicating the presence of glossy metal outlines. This is a common characteristic of enamel pins, where the metal outlines separate different enamel fills. The reflection and definition suggest a glossy finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pin have vibrant enamel fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors within the outlines are filled in a flat manner, but they do not appear particularly vibrant. Enamel pins typically have striking, colorful fills. Here, the color seems subdued or possibly minimal due to the contrast against the white background, indicating a lack of vibrancy.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any extra features added to the pin beyond the subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "From the visual inspection of Image B, it appears that the focus is solely on the subject's representation without additional elements or ornamental features. Enamel pins sometimes include extra designs for embellishment, but none are apparent here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is framed such that the overall dimensions suggest a square format, characterized by equal height and width, based on the presentation observed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the mockup white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background surrounding the pin is distinctly white. This can be determined by the contrast between the pin's edges and the background, offering a clear separation that highlights the pin itself against a plain white backdrop.",
