      "question": "Has the butterfly been transformed into a fairy-like figure with humanoid or magical characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transformed figure with humanoid characteristics such as a body structure resembling a human form, complete with arms, a dress-like shell, and a head with prominent eyes and antennae. The magical characteristics are evident from the glowing eyes, sparkling antennae, and surrounding stars. This transformation indicates a shift from a butterfly to a fairy-like figure, combining natural and fantastical elements. Image A depicts a butterfly form, with standard insect features, which contrasts the fairy-like figure observed in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the wings replaced with translucent, petal-like structures instead of traditional butterfly wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings visible are large, delicate, and resemble petals arranged in a layered fashion, creating a translucent effect indicative of fairy-like wings.

      "question": "Have the antennae been replaced with golden, sparkling tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases antennae that are transformed into glowing, golden tendrils, much like sparkling trails you might associate with a magical or mythical creature.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body in Image B demonstrates an integration of colorful floral textures, with overlapping petal designs and vibrant colors, creating a dress-like appearance characteristic of a fairy. In contrast, Image A maintains a more natural butterfly body with standard insect texture and coloration without any floral integration.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are designed as large orbs that appear to be glowing and have a sapphire blue tint, with added effects suggesting they emit light or magical energy. These differ entirely from the compound eyes characteristic of the butterfly in Image A, which are more realistic and muted.",
