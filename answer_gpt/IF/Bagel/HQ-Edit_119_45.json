        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image features a distinct steampunk aesthetic characterized by industrial elements such as gears, copper, and brass. Steampunk is a genre that incorporates steam-powered machinery, often made from brass or copper, accompanied by Victorian-era details. This is evident in the sculpture's numerous gears and metallic parts, combined with a mechanical-like appearance, which are typical in steampunk design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the headdress does not appear to maintain the original striped design. Instead, it is replaced with a mechanical construct adorned with gears and brass fittings, giving it a new steampunk look that does not preserve the initial appearance. The details do not show any attempt to retain the blue and gold stripe design typical of Egyptian art, further confirming the change.",
