      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a structured layout typical of a character card seen in RPG games, with attributes and a name prominently displayed. There is a section for the character's image, stats, and labels, commonly characteristic of such cards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the name 'Solara the Watcher' displayed on a sleek nameplate at the bottom of the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'Solara the Watcher' is indeed present on the card, but it is displayed on the top part of the card. This positioning does not satisfy the criterion of being displayed on a nameplate at the bottom.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, although it includes stat labels typical for an RPG card, the numbers '19,' '10,' and '18' are presented next to agility, curiosity, and charm, respectively. The phrasing '[Agility +9]' and so forth is not used. Therefore, the exact phrasing of the stat bars is absent.",
