        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features elements that are commonly found in cartoon farm sticker styles, such as simplified shapes, bright colors, and a playful depiction.

      "question": "Does the image feature a warm, chibi-like rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image is characterized by bright, bold colors and simplified, exaggerated features. While these features are somewhat in line with chibi style, which is characterized by cute, exaggerated proportions, the term 'warm' typically refers to gentle, soft tones which are not present here. Instead, there are vibrant and strong colors. Although it shares some characteristics with chibi style, these colors and lines suggest more of a cartoon style rather than explicitly chibi.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses bold outlines to define each part of the render, a common trait in graphic and cartoon illustrations to delineate shapes and enhance visibility. The bananas and stand are sharply outlined, a style choice prevalent in many cartoon renderings to make elements stand out.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a depiction of hills, shown as simple, rounded green shapes occupying the lower portion of the background. These stylized hills are consistent with cartoon landscapes, adding a simple but effective background element to the composition.",
