      "question": "Are the wings replaced with large, angular crystal shards in shades of opal and white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings appear to be large, angular, and are composed of crystal-like shards in shades of opal and white. They have a distinctly different texture and material from traditional feathered wings, which are depicted in Image A. By observing these characteristics, it can be concluded that the wings in Image B have indeed been replaced with a different design resembling large, angular crystal shards.",

      "question": "Is the hair replaced with golden, leafy strands woven into a crown-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is visually depicted with golden hues and includes leafy designs that create a crown-like structure surrounding the head. Unlike the wavy blonde hair seen in Image A, Image B features a more stylized and structured appearance. Based on the observation of these visual elements, it is clear that the hair has been altered in Image B to take on this ornate form.",

      "question": "Has the shirt been changed to a smooth velvet material while maintaining a white color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt retains a white color and appears to have a smooth texture. However, by visual assessment, it does not show any distinct characteristics typical of a velvet material, which usually has a distinct texture and sheen. Therefore, the shirt does not resemble velvet, despite retaining its white color.",

      "question": "Is the background a plain, deep gray wall with no visible objects or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B depicts a plain, deep gray wall. There are no visible objects or complex textures within the background, making it appear as a uniform, simple space. This differs from Image A, where the background is dimly lit with discernible furniture and elements. Therefore, the edited image features the described plain gray background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture and positioning of the figure in Image B appear to remain consistent with those in Image A. Both images show the figure standing upright, facing forward. The facial expressions cannot be evaluated in this context. Based on the observable data, the posture and positioning remain unchanged.",
