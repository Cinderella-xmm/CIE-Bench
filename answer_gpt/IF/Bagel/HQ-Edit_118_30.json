      "question": "Are the train cars depicted as large, colorful, interlocking blocks rather than realistic carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual appearance of the train cars shows large, colorful blocks instead of conventional train carriages. Each block appears to interlock with the next, resembling oversized puzzle pieces. This stands in contrast to traditional train cars, which are usually elongated and uniform. This visual information, paired with the common understanding of what train cars typically look like, confirms that the train cars in Image B are indeed represented as colorful interlocking blocks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the train rendered as swirling white forms instead of a realistic cloud of steam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke produced by the train is depicted in artistic swirling white forms, which are abstract and stylized rather than realistic. These forms curve smoothly and maintain a distinct, consistent shape, differing from the natural, billowing cloud of steam expected from a typical steam locomotive. The artistic choice in rendering highlights a departure from realism, suggesting a more creative and stylized interpretation.",

      "question": "Has the countryside landscape been converted into various geometric patterns such as grids, polygons, or angular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting beneath the train consists of interlocking large puzzle pieces, each piece vividly colored and shaped into different geometric forms. This layout replaces the typical rolling, organic appearance of a countryside landscape with flat, abstract geometric segments. The use of puzzle pieces as a design choice transforms the scene into a structured geometric pattern, focusing on shapes aligned and fitted together.",

      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with small puzzle pieces showing individuals in vintage clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features small figurines akin to game pieces rather than realistic portrayals of people. These miniatures are situated on puzzle pieces, showcasing a representation of people in vintage attire as depicted in small, toy-like forms. This choice is a clear departure from depicting full-size human figures, as seen in a real-world setting, indicating a playful and toy-like interpretation of individuals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire puzzle scene placed on a light-colored wooden tabletop with visible grain and edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The environment in Image B includes a light wood-colored background consistent with a tabletop surface. The visible wooden grain and clear edges signal that the puzzle scene is situated on a tabletop rather than suspended or placed in a natural ground setting, as is typical for puzzle assembly. This surface appearance and context are indicative of hobby or toy setups.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible interlocking edges, seams, or puzzle-piece borders throughout the scene indicating a complex, assembled structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is constructed using puzzle pieces, with precise, interlocking edges and seams visible throughout. These borders emphasize the nature of the scene as being part of a puzzle assembly, showcasing a network of connected shapes fitting intricately with one another. This assembly-style depiction is explicitly highlighted by the seams and edges, illustrating the puzzle's complexity.",
