        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are multiple sections showing different perspectives of an office environment. The section in the top left clearly displays two individuals sitting opposite each other at a desk, providing a front view of this particular setting. This perspective shows essentials like desks, chairs, and computer screens, confirming the inclusion of a front view of the office environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top right section depicts a man sitting at a desk with a computer, viewed from the side. This visualization offers a profile or side angle of the man and the desk setup. Such a side perspective showcases the placement and orientation of elements like the chair, desk, and computer, indicating the presence of a side view.",

      "question": "Does the image incorporate a top view of the office environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A top-view illustration would generally represent the office scene from an overhead perspective, highlighting the arrangement and layout of objects like desks and chairs from above. However, in Image B, none of the sections display this type of perspective. All views are from the side or front, not from above.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the three views (front, side, and top) depicted as distinct illustrations within one image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are sections showing both front and side views of the office environment, but not a top view. Each section presents a distinct illustration of different perspectives, but since the top view is absent, the image does not depict all three views as distinct illustrations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the combined illustrations show the full office environment layout comprehensively, covering essential elements like desks, chairs, and equipment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combined illustrations in Image B provide front and side views of the office environment, showcasing essential elements like desks, chairs, computer screens, and other furniture. However, without a top view, it might miss a comprehensive spatial understanding that a top view could offer, but it still effectively covers the essential elements and usage of office space.",
