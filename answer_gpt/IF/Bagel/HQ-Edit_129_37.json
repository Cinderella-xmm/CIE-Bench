    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the compass been transformed into a bottle-shaped object with a distinct body, neck, and cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has been altered to include features typical of a bottle: a wider base that tapers into a narrower neck, with a cap on top. The compass plate is now embedded into the top part where a cap typically would be in a bottle design. This transformation aligns with the description of a bottle shape with distinct body, neck, and cap, as compared to Image A where the object is a traditional compass without these features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object a circular glass-like container with the compass face visible as an embossed or raised pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the compass face is now part of a circular structure that resembles a glass-like container. The compass details appear embossed or raised against the surface, providing a three-dimensional effect, distinct from the purely functional compass face in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the compass needle been replaced with a metal spray nozzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the compass needle remains visible and intact as part of the compass face. There is no indication of a spray nozzle replacing the needle, suggesting the design maintains the needle element from Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cap of the object feature an engraving resembling a vintage map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap does not show any engraving or pattern resembling a vintage map. It is a solid metallic-looking piece, whereas the vintage map elements are present in the papers scattered beneath the object. Therefore, the cap is designed differently from this description.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the object have a bronze-toned gradient finish that gives it an antique appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the object displays a gradient finish that transitions from a bronze tone to a metallic color, instilling an antique and vintage look. Such finishes often deliver an aged aesthetic, consistent with the bronze-toned finish seen in Image A's compass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there minimalist branding (such as small text or logo) imprinted around the rim of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no observable minimalist branding or logo imprinted around the rim of the bottle. The compass details occupy the upper portion where a bottleâ€™s rim would typically be, without any branding elements, similar to the branding absence in Image A.",
