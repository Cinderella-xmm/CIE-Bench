      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the dog is depicted on the bed with the viewpoint clearly showing its left profile. This is evident from the visibility of the dog's left ear, left side of the face, and left side of the body, as illustrated. Combining this visual information with world knowledge, I can identify this as a left side view of the dog.",

      "question": "Is the dog illustrated from its back view within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the dogs is drawn facing away from the viewer, with the entirety of its back, tail, and rear-facing profile visible. This orientation clearly depicts a back view, as the dog’s face is not visible, and the focus is on its backside. This conclusion is drawn by visually assessing the dog's position and perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the left side and back views of the dog combined into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is composed of two dogs, creatively positioned to show two distinct perspectives – one from the left side and the other from the back view. Each dog occupies separate parts of the image, but both views coexist within this single frame. Combining the observation with world knowledge, the conclusion emerges that these views are combined in one image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dog shown on the bed in both the left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B shows the two dogs each positioned on the same bed. The dog highlighting the left side view is on the bed, and similarly, the dog showcasing the back view is also sitting on the bed. Observing the consistent depiction of the bed for both perspectives and applying recognition skills ensures the conclusion that the bed is present in both views.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bed and bedsheet appear consistently in both views of the dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed consists of wooden frames and is paired with green bedsheets, both of which are consistent and identical across the left side and back views of the dog. Observing the visual consistency of materials and colors in both perspectives leads to a confident conclusion that the bed and bedsheet are consistent.",
