      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented as a four-panel layout, each showing a different view of a serene lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image is organized into four separate panels, each depicting a variation of a similar scene featuring a serene lake background. This is evident from the consistent lake and mountain scenery across all four sections. The visual cues of identical subjects in distinct yet cohesive scenes indicate a four-panel layout.",

      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual is characterized by cartoon-style features, particularly noticeable through the exaggeratedly large, rounded eyes, a common trait in cartoon and anime art styles, which differentiates these characters from realistic human depictions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire appears to be a long robe adorned with floral patterns, contrasting with the more casual tank top and shorts seen in Image A. This change in clothing style from modern casual to more traditional and decorative is visually apparent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the person is consistently shown in a sitting position on the grass, engaged in the act of reading a book. This active pose and the combination of the action with the serene setting emphasize a tranquil and focused scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the landscape in Image B is characterized by soft color transitions and a washed-out effect, typical of watercolor painting. These artistic choices lend a diffused and gentle appearance to the natural elements, differing from the clearer, more defined style of Image A.",
