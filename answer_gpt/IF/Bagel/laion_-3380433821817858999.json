      "question": "Is the image now structured as a multi-panel infographic with at least three distinct steps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the visual structure is displayed in a multi-panel format. There are six distinct panels present, each illustrating a different action or sequence as part of the infographic. This clearly demonstrates that there are multiple steps being explained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a panel showing a simple figure in a kneeling position with bent arms pulled back, labeled as \"Step 1: Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the left-most panel of the top row in Image B, there is a figure in a kneeled position with their arms bent and pulled back. However, the label reads \"PIOSTONING; KNEL,\" which is a nonsensical or scrambled text rather than the label specified in the question.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a panel showing an explosive leaping motion with visual cues of propulsion (e.g., motion lines, energy burst), labeled as \"Step 2: Leap Attack: Propel using core strength\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does have a panel showing a figure in a leaping motion, but there are no clear visual cues like motion lines or energy bursts. The label for the second panel from the left in the top row reads \"LAEP-WIY ATCAQ;\" which again, does not match the specific label mentioned in the question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the final panel on the bottom right depicts a figure in a lowered position but it does not show the figure mid-air with tucked knees. Moreover, the label reads \"MID-ANEINDST\" which does not match the requested label.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features illustrations with bold outlines. The color scheme prominently includes vibrant blues and whites. The captions are written in a stylized font that appears energetic and is consistent with the dynamic theme of the panels.",
