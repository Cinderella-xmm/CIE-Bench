      "question": "Has the wooden material been replaced with transparent blue and teal crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish sculpture is depicted with a transparent, crystalline material characterized by blue and teal hues. This differs from any typical appearance of wooden material which lacks transparency and has a more opaque texture. The visual shift in material type highlights the change from something solid and non-reflective (like wood) in Image A to the glass-like, vibrant, and transparent crystalline material in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the facets and angles of the sculpture accurately represent the fish's scales and curved body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish sculpture is shown with numerous facets and angles that mimic the structure of fish scales. The intricately cut and varied angles contribute to depicting the fish's natural curved body shape, which is consistent with common representations of fish in art and design. This suggests an effort to accurately capture the detailed texture of scales using the reflective properties of crystal.",

      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit glossy, reflective surfaces that suggest water-like fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the sculpture in Image B appears to be highly glossy and reflects the light, creating a water-like effect. This reflective quality is typical of crystalline or glass-like materials, contributing to an impression of fluidity akin to the flow of water. This is visually noticeable in the way the sculpture interacts with light, producing shimmering reflections, much like a liquid surface.",

      "question": "Is the sculpture presented in a minimalist white gallery space with no visible distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is placed in an environment that appears predominantly white and clean, typical of a minimalist gallery setting. There are no other elements or objects visible around the sculpture, which emphasizes the artwork and reduces distractions, allowing it to be the focal point. This kind of presentation is common in gallery displays to highlight the artwork without interference.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture mounted on a sleek, mirrored pedestal that reflects its image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture appears to be set atop a platform that has a reflective way, as seen by the clarity and brightness in the base area, suggesting a mirror-like quality. Though the exact mirroring effect is subtle, the overall reflective nature of the pedestal complements the sculpture's crystalline attributes, enhancing its aesthetic presentation.",
