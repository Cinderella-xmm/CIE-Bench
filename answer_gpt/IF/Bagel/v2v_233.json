      "question": "Is the leaf enclosed within a transparent spherical container resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is visible within a clear, round object that resembles a snow globe. The curved, spherical shape and transparency of the object containing the leaf is characteristic of a typical snow globe. This understanding is based on visual observation of the object’s form and the common design of snow globes.",

      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a surface resembling a tabletop near a window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe resting on a flat, horizontal surface, similar to a tabletop. Additionally, the lighting in the image suggests proximity to a window, as there is a warm glow characteristic of sunlight entering a room. This combination of factors—placement on a surface and lighting conditions—is consistent with a tabletop near a window.",

      "question": "Is the background softly blurred and contains warm tones such as orange or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be out of focus, giving it a soft, blurred effect. The colors in the background primarily include warm tones like orange and yellow. This is indicative of lighting conditions such as sunset or interior lighting that provides a cozy ambiance.",

      "question": "Are there golden sparkles scattered within the snow globe due to sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features bright spots within and around the snow globe, resembling sparkles. These sparkles have a slight golden hue, likely a result of sunlight interacting with elements within the snow globe. Such visual details and interplay of light give an impression of golden sparkles caused by sunlight.",

      "question": "Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B includes a snow globe with a leaf inside, it does not show water or ripples as depicted in Image A. Instead, there are decorative snowflakes typical of a snow globe effect. Therefore, the leaf is not shown suspended in water with ripples but rather encased within a traditional snow globe setting with drifting snowflakes, indicating a decorative, dry setup instead of an aquatic environment.",
