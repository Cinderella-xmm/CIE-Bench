        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a box with a design and layout characteristic of Funko Pop figure boxes, including an isometric perspective that displays both the front and the side of the box.

      "question": "Does the box contain a chibi-style kangaroo figure with a pouch, a grassy base, and hopping-related elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure inside the box is depicted in a chibi style, characterized by a large head and simplified body proportions typical of this aesthetic. However, it lacks a visible pouch, which is a defining feature of kangaroos. The base appears grassy, but there are no clear hopping-related elements visible on the figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure outside the packaging is in the same chibi style as the one inside, with exaggerated features and simple textures. It lacks the intricate textures and realistic lighting that would characterize a highly realistic depiction. The effect is more cartoonish and stylized.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the kangaroo is depicted in a realistic setting with a natural pose. In Image B, the chibi figure and packaging completely redefine the original context, with no remnants of the original pose or the natural setting. The elements have not been integrated; instead, they have replaced the original context and appearance entirely.",
