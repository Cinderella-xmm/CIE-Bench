    "Question": "Q1: Is the image presented as a series of separate stamp-like elements arranged in a grid or collection format, each resembling a paper-cut design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design appears to be a single, unified piece rather than a series of separate elements or a grid layout. The elements within the frame, such as the hanbok and background, are styled in a paper-cut fashion, but they are not divided into individual stamps. The consistent design within a single frame indicates that it is one cohesive artwork rather than a collection.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral embroidery details on the hanbok enhanced with visible metallic foil effects (e.g., shiny, reflective highlights)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hanbok is designed with floral embroidery that appears enhanced with gold-like effects, giving it a metallic sheen. This appearance might be intended to simulate the look of metallic foil, with visible highlights and an impression of reflectivity, typical of such an effect in designs or illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Has the bow on the hanbok been visibly enlarged compared to its original size in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bow on the hanbok seems relatively more prominent due to the stylized, illustrative nature of the design. In Image A, the bow is naturally sized and proportionate to the garment, but in Image B, the illustrative effect might be causing the bow to stand out more or appear larger. However, without direct size comparison, it's not visibly enlarged beyond its typical representation.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the traditional Korean architectural background clearly visible and properly integrated into the overall composition of the stamp series?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features elements of traditional Korean architecture, which are stylized and integrated within the overall design. These elements are designed to complement the main subject without overshadowing it, indicating a proper integration into the overall composition but not as a separate stamp or series.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire stamp series displayed on a surface that resembles embossed leather with visible texture and depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the frame appears to be surrounded by a surface that resembles textured, embossed leather, presenting a depth and tactile quality. This texture frames the central image, enhancing the sense of materiality and adding to the visual appeal of the central paper-cut design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
