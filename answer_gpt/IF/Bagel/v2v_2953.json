      "question": "Does the cocktail glass appear to be sculpted from clay with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass displays distinctive attributes of hand-sculpted clay, such as visible surface texture and irregularities that are common in clay figures. The glass is shaped with layered clay material, offering a tactile appearance, characteristic of clay sculpting. Therefore, based on the analysis of visual cues and common knowledge of clay sculptures, the glass is indeed sculpted from clay.",

      "question": "Are the ice cubes and lime slice depicted with intricate clay textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes and lime slice are transformed into clay objects. The ice cubes are not real but implied by the clay texture similar to the rest of the sculpture. The lime slice is modeled with clay, showcasing artistic representation without the realistic texture seen in actual fruit. The absence of these realistic textures, replaced by artful clay molds, indicates that the ice cubes and lime slice are depicted with intricate clay textures.",

      "question": "Do the surroundings, including the bar and bottles, exhibit a handcrafted clay appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses exclusively on a clay sculpture representing the cocktail glass with its components, without showing backgrounds like the bar or bottles. Thus, there is no observable clay representation of the surroundings provided in this image. Using contextual knowledge about the style and content of Image B, the surroundings are not depicted and hence do not exhibit a clay appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition maintain an organic, imperfect look characteristic of hand-sculpted clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire composition in Image B exudes characteristics of hand-sculpted clay. Observing the glass form with its expressive fingers, subtle asymmetry, and imperfections, recognizable in handcrafted clay art, contributes to the organic and imperfect appeal. Based on the visual analysis, the overall composition indeed maintains this look, typical of artisan crafting.",

      "question": "Is the lighting and shading adjusted to enhance the clay-like textures and three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents well-considered lighting and shading, accentuating the clay model to showcase textures and dimensions effectively. The highlights emphasize numerous clay details on the sculpture, adding depth and enhancing the three-dimensional perception. Therefore, visual cues indicate the lighting and shading are purposefully adjusted to enrich the clay texture presentation.",
