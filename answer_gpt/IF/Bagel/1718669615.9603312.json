      "question": "Is the spaceship visually transformed into a style resembling a Greek amphora painting, with flat, stylized forms and decorative borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object displayed is a vase with geometric patterns and decorative borders, common features found in Greek amphora paintings. The shapes and styling align with ancient pottery's aesthetic rather than a spaceship design. Comparing it with a traditional depiction of a spaceship, which typically features three-dimensional and realistic depictions, this transformation is notable. Therefore, the object has been transformed into a style resembling Greek amphora painting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible stylized circular motifs incorporated into the design of the spaceship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a vase decorated with various geometric patterns, including large circular motifs characteristic of stylized ancient pottery designs. This design does not show a traditional spaceship appearance but rather a ceramic theme focused on circular and linear elements. Therefore, these motifs are now part of the object, though it's not a spaceship in the traditional sense.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spaceship include intricate meander patterns as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object shows a vase with complex geometric designs, including meander patterns, recognizable in ancient Greek art. These patterns are intricately woven into the surface akin to traditional pottery decorations, different from typical spaceship designs. Thus, the 'spaceship' incorporates these intricate meander patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the landscape below been transformed into elongated abstract waveforms rather than realistic terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the vase displays patterns resembling elongated, abstract waveforms, distinguishing them from the realistic highways and natural landscapes observable in a typical reality-based setting. These are stylized and consistent with the artistic transformation of the vase itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the color palette of the landscape composed primarily of muted earth tones consistent with ancient pottery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B uses muted earth tones—browns, beiges, and muted blues—common in ancient pottery, rather than the diverse and realistic colors of a landscape. These tones complement the vase's pottery style, emphasizing the stylistic cohesion with traditional ceramic art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the spaceship is now represented by a vase in pottery style, the overall composition, wherein the vase is positioned prominently over an abstracted background, suggests a similar spatial prominence akin to the spaceship's position over a landscape in Image A. This preserves the essence of the spatial relationship aligned with stylistic changes.",
