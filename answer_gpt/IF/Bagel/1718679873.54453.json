    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the robot now a miniature 3D articulated model instead of a full-sized giant robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is indeed presented as a small model enclosed within a display case, indicating that it is now a miniature version rather than a full-sized giant robot as appeared in Image A, which showcases the robot as a towering figure dominating the landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robot enclosed within a circular display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot encapsulated within a clear display case that has a rounded, cylindrical shape. This contrasts with Image A where there is no such enclosure, highlighting the transformation from a life-sized entity to a model within a glass case.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are visible gears integrated into the robot's structure, particularly noticeable in the chest and limbs under transparent segments. These elements suggest a detailed, mechanical composition of the model, which differs from the solid metal appearance of Image A's giant robot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display positioned on a hexagonal black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire display setup, including the robot and its case, is mounted on a clearly defined hexagonal black base. This specific base format is part of the overall presentation of the model. In Image A, there is no such base as the robot stands on the ground.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the robot’s model number etched in a luminous silver font on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the display in Image B features some text with a metallic sheen, which implies an engraving or print that represents identification or branding, typical for model displays. In Image A, there is no base or engraving present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a miniaturized landscape around the display that reflects the original scene’s elements (e.g., trees, terrain, distant city)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a small-scale landscape within the base, including miniature trees and a path, reminiscent of the natural elements in Image A's scene. This suggests an effort to capture aspects of the original environment in a diminutive format as part of the display.",
