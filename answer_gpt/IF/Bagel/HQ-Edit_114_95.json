      "question": "Has the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a bottle-shaped object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent object in the center that is bottle-shaped and takes the place of the Eiffel Tower's location in Image A. The bottle is large and occupies the central focal point of the image. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the Eiffel Tower has been replaced with a bottle-shaped object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the structure have a transparent or glass-like appearance with embossed lattice patterns resembling the Eiffel Tower's framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a transparent, glass-like quality. It resembles a bottle rather than having embossed lattice patterns like the Eiffel Tower. While it integrates the image of the Eiffel Tower within the glass, it does not feature any embossed lattice patterns on its structure itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a gold-colored, metallic-looking base supporting the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower portion of the transparent bottle features a gold-colored liquid, which might appear reflective but it is not a base of the bottle structure supporting it. The perceived base is actually formed by a visual component inside the glass rather than a physical gold-colored metallic base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a faint depiction of a Parisian skyline visible on the surface of the glass bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the glass bottle, there appears to be an image of the Eiffel Tower and the Parisian skyline visible through the transparent medium. This depicts not on the surface, but in the internal content of the glass bottle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small, simple, and modern logo located at the neck of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the neck of the bottle, there is a logo present which is small and modern in design. This indicates that the branding or label typical of product packaging is visible in this part of the bottle.",
