      "question": "Does the wombat in the stickers have overly large, expressive eyes and gentle facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat displays cartoonish, exaggerated features typical of 'chibi' or cute design styles. The eyes are disproportionately large compared to the overall head size, contributing to a sense of expressiveness and emotion often found in such caricatures. The facial expressions are gentle and evoke different emotions, such as sadness, surprise, or affection, which are emphasized through the visual exaggeration of the eyes and subtle lines. Therefore, the design choice aligns with typical chibi characteristics.",

      "question": "Are all six distinct poses correctly depicted in the stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are nine separate sticker designs visible in Image B, each showing the wombat in a unique pose or expression. The stickers illustrate a range of emotions and postures, suggesting a variety of scenarios or reactions. Poses include standing, sitting, covering the face, and gesturing in different ways. Thus, within the context of nine visible designs, 'six distinct poses' implies the presence of at least that many, and these are indeed present in the image. Therefore, the stickers encompass the requirement for multiple unique depictions.",

      "question": "Is the wombat wearing a fun Hawaiian shirt and straw hat similar to those in the reference image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the wombat is depicted wearing a straw hat and a short-sleeved shirt with Hawaiian-style motifs. In the stickers, the shirt retains a tropical design theme, and the straw hat is consistently presented, maintaining a connection in attire between the two images. The choice of clothing implies a playful or vacation-like theme, typical of a Hawaiian shirt and straw hat ensemble that matches the reference image's intention.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the stickers include bright tropical tones with hibiscus flowers, palm fronds, or fruity drink designs in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the stickers in Image B integrates bright colors and tropical themes. The presence of large hibiscus flowers is evident, providing a vivid splash of color, and complements the tropical aesthetic. While the stickers focus primarily on the character's design, the background elements enhance the tropical feeling characteristic of such images. Although fruity drinks are not individually present as per expectations, the device of floral and tropical motifs upholds the thematic atmosphere.",

      "question": "Are the stickers designed with a dimension ratio of 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B are arranged in a grid layout, each as separate square designs. A 9:16 ratio suggests a vertically oriented rectangular shape, which is a common format for screens or images intended for certain digital media. However, the individual sticker designs appear to fit within squares rather than rectangles with a pronounced vertical extension. As such, the dimension ratio does not conform to the specified 9:16 format.",
