      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the scene (road, sky, trees, poles) fragmented into geometric shapes such as polygons, rectangles, and triangles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements of the scene such as the sky, road, trees, and poles are visually represented with geometric shapes. The sky appears fragmented into polygons and rectangles, the trees are rendered in triangles, and the overall scene is characterized by angular and sharp lines. This stylization is indicative of an abstract representation where realistic continuity is broken down into geometric forms. Common art and design knowledge suggest this technique is often used for abstraction to simplify or stylize natural scenes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the road composed of angular, non-smooth sections instead of a smooth, curving surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road is depicted using angular lines and shapes, as opposed to the smooth, curving nature expected in a natural scene. The geometric abstraction is evident as the road is constructed with sharp angles and straight edges instead of a continuous, flowing path. This aligns with methods used in abstract and cubist art, where natural forms are stylized into sharp, angular representations, thereby removing the smoothness found in realistic depictions.",

      "question": "Are the clouds represented as overlapping quadrilateral or polygonal shapes rather than soft, natural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are designed with an overlap of quadrilateral and polygonal shapes, lacking the softness and amorphous qualities found in natural cloud formations. Instead of fluffy, curved edges, the clouds are angular and composed of interconnected geometric forms. This technique is common in abstract art forms that prioritize structural design over naturalistic features.",

      "question": "Are the telegraph poles rendered in a stylized, geometric form using angular lines and shapes rather than realistic proportions and textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the telegraph poles are depicted using simplified and geometric forms, represented by linear angular shapes rather than detailed textures or realistic proportions. They appear as stark, straight lines devoid of the intricate details you would find on actual poles. Such abstraction is typical in art styles that focus on geometric simplicity rather than realistic imitation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as abstract triangular shapes rather than natural, rounded tree canopies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are represented as simplified triangular shapes instead of the naturally rounded canopies one would expect from real trees. This abstraction into geometric forms is a common practice in certain styles of art to convey the idea of a tree through simple shapes instead of complex, natural forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image use only muted greens, grays, and deep yellows, avoiding bright or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a palette that consists of muted greens, grays, and deep yellows. The colors are not bright or saturated, reflecting a subdued and stylized approach to the scene. Such a color scheme is often used in artwork that aims to create a certain mood or tone, steering away from vibrant and intense hues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clear sense of depth and perspective in the scene, with the road leading toward a distant horizon despite the geometric abstraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the use of geometric abstraction in Image B, there is still an evident depth and perspective. The road visibly narrows as it leads toward the horizon, providing a sense of distance and depth similar to realistic scenes. The continuation of the road into the distance indicates an adherence to perspective principles even within a highly stylized and abstract depiction.",
