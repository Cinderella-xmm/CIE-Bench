      "question": "Does the edited image contain only the girl, the stone platform, and the frisbee without any other distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate the presence of a girl standing on a stone platform holding a frisbee. The background consists solely of a grassy field and a gradient blue sky, with no other objects or distractions visible. The composition is simplistic and focused on the described elements without additional complexities or clutter.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a wide expanse of grass and a blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From observing Image B, the background clearly features a wide expanse of green grass and a gradient blue sky, creating a clean and open setting. This background effectively replaces any other potential elements that might have been present in the original image, highlighting only the essential components specified.",

      "question": "Does the composition of the edited image adhere to the golden ratio principles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden ratio is a design principle often applied to create pleasing aesthetics through balance and proportion. In Image B, the girl and the stone platform are centrally located, but there is a lack of visual movement or division typical of the golden ratio's dynamic balance. The composition is simplistic and symmetric rather than following the dynamic and asymmetrical arrangement usually dictated by the golden ratio.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists only of the girl, the stone platform, and the frisbee, along with the natural grassy background and sky. The simplicity of the image ensures that no additional elements are present, maintaining a clean and uncluttered appearance without distractions from the described focus.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image fulfills the outlined criteria with its simplicity, clarity, and focused composition featuring specified elements against a uniform background. However, the absence of adherence to artistic principles like the golden ratio could limit its use in training data meant to emphasize these principles. Nevertheless, for general training emphasizing composition and clarity, the image is suitable.",
