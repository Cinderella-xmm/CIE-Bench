      "question": "Is the ship and seascape rendered as a spherical 3D globe rather than a flat scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship and seascape are clearly contained within a glass-like sphere, which is indicative of a globe structure. This contrasts with a flat scene which would not curve around the edges as seen here. The spherical nature is further suggested by the curvature at the edges and the overall 3D effect of the view.",
