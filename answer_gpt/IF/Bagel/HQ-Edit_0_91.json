    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) presents the figure with bold outlines and flat color fills, typical of a semi-cartoon style where features and details are simplified. The artistic approach appears to prioritize stylization over realism, which is characteristic of this rendering method.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textile patterns on the robe enhanced with visible gold leaf accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the robe's textile patterns display vibrant colors and stylization, but they lack the realistic nuance of gold leaf accents seen in the original image (Image A). The patterns are represented graphically, but without any indication of metallic sheen or luxury detailing typical of gold leaf enhancement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the hands visibly enlarged compared to their original size in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image (Image B), the hands seem proportionately consistent with the semi-cartoon style, where exaggeration is more about simplification rather than distortion. Comparing them to the original image (Image A), the hands in Image B do not appear significantly larger, maintaining the general proportions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image have a deep indigo border framing the entire composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a prominent indigo border around the entire composition, framing the figure within a distinct boundary. This border is evident and establishes a separation between the central artwork and its background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines extending from the robe into the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) includes floral outlines in the frame that complement the artistic style. These floral designs appear hand-drawn and extend slightly beyond the robe's textile patterns into the frame, adding to the stylized aesthetic of the composition.",
