      "question": "Is the image presented as a mounted card with visible borders and a card-like format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is presented as an art piece with a clearly defined border that resembles a card or frame. The paper appears to have an aged, textured look, with a decorative, scalloped edge which is typical of mounted or decorative card art. This gives a card-like appearance to the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered as a silhouette with intricate, decorative cut-out patterns characteristic of paper-cut art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is presented as a black silhouette that distinctly contrasts against the background, and it displays intricate patterns typical of paper-cut art. The detailed patterns on the silhouette, including floral motifs, are characteristic of this artistic style, indicating the use of decorative cut-outs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book held by the figure noticeably larger than normal proportion, appearing exaggerated in size compared to the person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette shows a person holding a book that appears proportionally similar to what would be considered normal human scale. There are no indications or visual cues which suggest that the book's size is exaggerated or disproportionally large compared to the person.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible ornate lace patterns integrated into the sweater, such as floral or openwork designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the silhouette representation, the details instead depict intricate patterns representative of lace or decorative cut-out elements. However, these patterns are on the silhouette itself, not directly implying the presence of a real sweater with lace. Within the context of the silhouette art style, intricate patterns can suggest lace or openwork designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the background bookshelves simplified in detail (e.g., fewer books, less depth) but still show subtle textural elements like grain or aging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no explicit bookshelves depicted, as the background portrays an aged paper texture with writing, typical of antique script. This is rather different from the real, detailed bookshelf and library background in the original image (Image A). Hence, nothing refers to simplified bookshelves with textural elements in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the image mounted on a background that appears to be textured, antique-gold colored cardstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the silhouette art is a textured paper with aged script, resembling parchment or antique paper, rather than cardstock. Its color leans more towards an aged or sepia tone than a distinct antique gold, indicative of old, preserved paper. Thus, it doesn't present features strongly indicating an antique-gold cardstock.",
