    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sock is visibly constructed from LEGO-style bricks. These bricks are interlocked in a consistent manner, typical of LEGO construction, with clear demarcations and shadows between each brick piece. This suggests a fully brick-based construction without any apparent fabric or other materials present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of different colored bricks creates a pattern that mimics the original sock's colors in Image A. The black, gray, and white hues are translated into LEGO bricks, and the pattern structure is maintained even though it takes on a geometric, blocky form inherent to LEGO brick construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B shows a three-dimensional form with a noticeable depth. This is achieved through the strategic placement and stacking of bricks at various heights, along with the shadows cast by the reliefs of the bricks, contributing to the layered appearance typical in such LEGO constructions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of the sock in Image B, there is a distinct orange piece corresponding to the tag seen in Image A. This suggests the tag is represented by an orange LEGO brick, maintaining the original design cue from the sock.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO sculpture placed on a pedestal in a well-lit, simple backdrop. The environment is clean and free from any clutter, akin to a gallery setting, which helps in focusing the viewer's attention solely on the sculpture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B displays a high level of architectural detail. The rows of bricks are neatly aligned, with clearly defined edges creating a structured form. This intricate design highlights intentionality in the construction process typical of carefully executed LEGO architectures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
