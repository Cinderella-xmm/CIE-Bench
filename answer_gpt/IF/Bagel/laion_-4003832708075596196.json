    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the tree trunk been reshaped into distinct arm and leg forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunk has been reshaped to create anthropomorphic figures that include distinct arms and legs, unlike a standard tree trunk. This transformation turns the tree into character-like entities, resembling human forms with limbs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements positioned as heads with cartoonish facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes characters that have heads, which are likely leaf-shaped and feature cartoonish facial expressions. These are used to give the anthropomorphic tree figures more personality by adding facial elements, diverging from the natural leaf arrangement seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leaf faces display visible cartoonish facial expressions (e.g., eyes, mouth, eyebrows)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish characters show clear facial expressions, including features such as eyes and mouths, intended to make them appear emotive and lively. This addition diverges from the purely decorative leaves in Image A and is indicative of a cartoon or comic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are hats and scarves present on the anthropomorphic tree characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic tree figures are accessorized with hats and scarves. These additions emphasize the cartoon-like transformation and align with common anthropomorphic character design, which is not present in Image A that features a regular tree.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there text bubbles with Thanksgiving greetings placed around the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains text bubbles around the anthropomorphic characters, which are a typical element of comics used to convey speech or thoughts. Although the text isn't clear, their presence suggests communication or greeting, aligned with the Thanksgiving theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire illustration, including characters and text bubbles, contained within the original border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B maintains a border similar to that in Image A, and the cartoon characters and text bubbles are all contained within it. This respects the original layout, ensuring all elements are framed within the design confines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all colors used in the illustration consistent with the autumn palette (orange, yellow, red, brown)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly uses colors like red, yellow, orange, and brown for the characters, leaves, and other elements. These colors are traditionally associated with autumn and Thanksgiving, similar to those in Image A, maintaining thematic consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the text \"Happy Thanksgiving\" still visible below the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original text 'Happy Thanksgiving' seen in Image A has been replaced with a different, less legible phrase at the bottom, which includes a play on words or humor. This alteration deviates from the straightforward greeting present in Image A.",
