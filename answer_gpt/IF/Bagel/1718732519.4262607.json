      "question": "Is the hot dog replaced with a model made of red, yellow, and tan LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a hot dog is made of LEGO bricks, clearly comprising red, yellow, and tan colors. The distinct blocky appearance and color arrangement indicate it's a LEGO construction instead of an actual hot dog, reflecting a playful reinterpretation. The combination of colors, precision of shape, and texture typical of LEGO bricks supports the identification.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the original bottle been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is replaced by an object with decorative mosaic patterns, indicating a shift from a cylindrical smooth bottle to an ornate vase-like ceramic with colorful tiles. The visual detail in the object contrasts with the simplicity of a bottle shape, showcasing it as a crafted artistic item rather than a functional bottle. This change is interpreted as an intended artistic expression.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece feature geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic piece displays a variety of geometric patterns made from tiles in multiple colors, including red and yellow. However, tan appears to be absent; instead, there are additional colors like blue and green, contributing to a complex mosaic design. The colors are used strategically both for bright and contrasting effects within its artistic arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic piece placed on a smooth wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement seen in Image B shows both the LEGO hot dog and the ceramic piece placed upon what appears to be a flat, smooth wooden base. The consistent smooth finish of the base complements the neatness of LEGO constructions and ceramic displays, indicating a choice to unify the presentation of these art objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the LEGO hot dog maintain an elongated, cylindrical shape similar to a real hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO hot dog in Image B maintains an elongated form, achieved through the linear arrangement of bricks. Although varying in detail due to the block nature of LEGO, this structure fundamentally resembles the cylindrical shape of a real hot dog, highlighting the shape consistency despite the material difference. Such interpretations leverage playful adaptations while retaining the basic form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece have a rounded, artistic form rather than a realistic bottle shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic piece displays a rounded, complex shape akin to an art vase rather than a simple bottle design like in Image A. The distinct mosaic design adds to its artistic quality, often associated with decorative intentions rather than practical use. The contours and patterns embody elements typical of handcrafted, aesthetic pieces, distinguishing it from utilitarian shapes.",
