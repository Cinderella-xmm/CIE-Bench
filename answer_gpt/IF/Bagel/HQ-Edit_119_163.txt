    "Question": "Q2: Are the dragon engravings still present and visibly detailed on the body of the canister?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the canister features dragon engravings that are still visible and detailed on its surface, although they are visually distinct from the sculpted engravings on the original teapot in Image A.

    "Question": "Q3: Has the original hinged lid been replaced with a metallic screw cap?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the canister topped with a metallic screw cap, which has visible threading that is typical of screw lids.

    "Question": "Q4: Are intricate tea leaf patterns embossed around the circumference of the screw cap?",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" visibly inscribed along the length of the spout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text \"Dragon's Delight\" is prominently printed on the body of the canister rather than on any spout. Given the design of the canister, there is no spout present, making the inscription along a spout impossible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a minimalist tea leaf logo located on the top center of the screw cap?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the minimalist tea leaf logo is actually located on the side of the canister, above the text \"Dragon's Delight,\" rather than on the top center of the screw cap. Thus, the logo's placement does not match the description.",
    "answer": "No"
