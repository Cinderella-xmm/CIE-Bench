      "question": "Does the male character's tee have a plush 3D appearance with a bold geometric pattern and an enlarged collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character's tee is visually textured with a plush, 3D look. The pattern on the shirt is vibrant and geometric, with a combination of blues, oranges, and whites. Additionally, the collar appears thicker and more pronounced than a typical T-shirt collar. These elements create a bold and visually striking appearance that suggests a plush, bold, geometric pattern combined with an enlarged collar.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the male character's pants rendered in a plush 3D style with a bold geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character's pants clearly display a plush, 3D texture. The geometric pattern is consistent with the top, featuring similar colors and a similarly bold and playful design. This plush appearance indicates a deliberate design choice that emphasizes the character's cartoonish and exaggerated style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the female character's high-waisted pants feature exaggerated, prominent pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female character wears a pleated skirt, not pants. The skirt has well-defined pleats that are part of its design, which fits the overall aesthetic being portrayed. Although these pleats are prominent, they are typical of pleated skirts rather than exaggerated features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sleeve of the female character's top visibly enlarged compared to normal proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The female character's top in Image B is designed in a chibi style, where proportions are not meant for realism but for cuteness and emphasis on certain features. The sleeve appears proportionate to the overall outfit and character design which adheres to the stylized, plush aesthetic rather than being enlarged disproportionately.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both characters rendered as chibi-style figurines with large heads, small bodies, and cartoonish proportions, dancing on a pastel-colored stage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted in a chibi-style, evident from their proportionally larger heads and smaller bodies. Their cartoon-like features and plush appearance support the chibi characterization. However, there is no indication of them dancing or being placed on a stage. The background is simplistic and does not represent a stage for dancing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the characters exhibit graceful dance poses, joyful expressions, and are placed on a pastel-colored stage, conveying playful elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the characters are posed together in a manner typical of showcasing, there is no clear indication or detail in their pose that suggests a dance. Furthermore, the background is a plain, light-colored surface, not a stage that would suggest a performance setting. Consequently, they do not convey the sense of a dance pose or performance.",
