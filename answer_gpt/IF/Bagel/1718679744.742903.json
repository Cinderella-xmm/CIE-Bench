        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is depicted using flat, solid color regions and exaggerated features, such as the bold, bright colors of the hat and sunglasses, combined with simplified, graphic elements typical of pop art.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual elements in Image B show the crocodile, hat, and sunglasses outlined with bold, continuous black lines. This is a common technique in pop and graphic art to emphasize form and separate the various elements of the image, making the image appear more cartoon-like and graphic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a hat and sunglasses in highly saturated, vivid colors, such as electric pink and hot orange, which stand out and are typical of neon colors. These colors are used to create a visually striking image and are associated with energetic and youthful aesthetics, often used in pop and contemporary art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the crocodileâ€™s scales been replaced with a consistent, repeating geometric pattern (e.g., squares, rectangles, or dots)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original texture of the crocodile's scales has been substituted with a consistent, repeating geometric pattern that resembles a grid-like structure of shapes, which emphasizes a more graphic and abstract depiction of the crocodile.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit high color contrast between the crocodile, hat, sunglasses, and background, with minimal shading and a stylized, graphic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in Image B displays high color contrast between the elements such as the crocodile, hat, sunglasses, and background, creating a strong graphic appearance. Minimal shading is used, which gives the image a flat, stylized look typical of graphic design and pop art influences, where colors are distinct and areas of different colors are clearly separated.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing both images, the pose and position of the crocodile are consistent in both Image A and Image B. The hat is positioned on top of the crocodile's head, and the sunglasses are over its eyes in both images, maintaining the same arrangement and general stance.",
