    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image show the building transformed into a giant mechanical golem with visible articulated limbs and exposed gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure resembles a giant robot or mechanical golem rather than a typical building. It has articulated limbs such as arms and legs, which are characteristic of a living creature or machine, not a static building. This transformation from building characteristics to robotic features involves adding elements like joints and visible mechanical components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all original windows replaced with glowing energy panels that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sections that would correspond to the windows on a building now look like areas that emit light, resembling energy panels or sources of illumination. The glow from these segments suggests a significant transformation from their original form in architectural context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the balconies been transformed into arm-like mechanical appendages extending from the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that instead of traditional balconies typically found on buildings, there are structures that resemble arms or mechanical appendages. These features extend in ways similar to limbs, indicating a transformation focusing on mechanical design over architectural features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate circuit patterns covering the surface of the building, resembling electronic wiring or circuits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface does not show any intricate circuit patterns typical of electronic devices. Instead, the mechanical creation has a more structured and block-like appearance rather than imitation of circuit wiring.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the building's angular edges appear as dynamic or movable mechanical components, such as hinges, pistons, or rotating joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays features that suggest mechanical movement, such as hinges or joints. These features, seen as parts of the robot's structure, indicate functionality for movement, unlike static architectural components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background still a clear blue sky without any changes or additions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the background of a clear blue sky, unchanged from what typically accompanies such an architectural or mechanical depiction. This consistency maintains focus on the central transformation while preserving environmental background elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the buildingâ€™s overall size and position within the frame remained consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited structure, now robotic, still occupies a similar space within the frame. Its orientation and proportional occupation in the image are consistent with Image A, suggesting no alterations in scale or placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
