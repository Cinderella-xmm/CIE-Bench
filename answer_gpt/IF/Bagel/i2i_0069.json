      "question": "Is there a holographic projection screen added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visual element that appears as a light cyan or neon blue overlay with distinct geometric patterns and lines, resembling a projection. This is consistent with what would be considered a holographic projection screen in a futuristic setting. The presence of this element indicates that a holographic screen has been added to the image.",

      "question": "Does the holographic projection appear to emerge from the man's phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible phone or person from which the holographic projection emerges. The projection is simply overlaid onto the scene without any source device visible in the frame, such as a phone typically associated with holographic displays. Therefore, the conclusion is that the projection does not appear to emerge from a phone.",

      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen display a city map interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic projection in Image B consists of many geometric patterns and lines, but it lacks any recognizable landmarks, street names, or navigational symbols that would suggest a city map. It appears more like a generic grid or schematic rather than a detailed city layout.",

      "question": "Is the holographic projection screen designed in a futuristic and transparent style characteristic of sci-fi elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic projection in Image B is designed with a light cyan or neon blue color and intricate lines and patterns, which are commonly used in sci-fi designs to represent technology and futuristic interfaces. The semi-transparent overlay style also aligns with typical sci-fi holograms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparison, the rest of Image B remains consistent with Image A, with the exception of the added holographic projection. There are no other noticeable edits or unintended changes elsewhere in the scene, as the sandwich, knife, and papers remain unchanged from Image A.",
