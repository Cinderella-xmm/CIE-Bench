      "question": "Is the tank's body composed entirely of olive and dark green LEGO bricks, showing a blocky, modular construction consistent with LEGO building style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank's body exhibits the characteristic blocky, modular appearance of LEGO construction, using mainly olive and dark green colors. This can be identified by the presence of visible studs and the distinctly angular shapes typical of LEGO bricks, which contrasts with the smooth, metallic surface often seen on actual tanks. Given these observations, the tank in Image B is consistent with LEGO's modular style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the orange tiger decal been replaced with a pattern made of colorful LEGO plates forming a whimsical tiger face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the orange tiger decal is located in Image A is now covered with colorful LEGO plates that create a playful interpretation of a tiger face. This transformation from a flat decal to a three-dimensional pattern formed by LEGO bricks introduces a more whimsical and lighthearted aesthetic, which is common in LEGO designs that transform real-life objects into playful, blocky forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tankâ€™s treads made of textured LEGO bricks with visible studs and blocky segments, rather than continuous rubber tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tank's treads in Image B appear to be constructed from textured LEGO bricks, characterized by visible studs and block-like segments. This differs from the traditional continuous rubber tracks seen in Image A. The segmented, angular design aligns with how LEGO sets represent vehicles, creating a more stylized and simplified rendition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tank positioned on a smooth, flat wooden platform without visible gravel or irregular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the platform beneath the tank shows some texture and gravel, similar to the platform in Image A. This contradicts the notion of a completely smooth and flat wooden surface. The presence of gravel indicates that while the tank has been altered to look like LEGO, the surroundings have not been similarly transformed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a back panel made of green LEGO bricks behind the tank, designed to mimic foliage and replace the natural tree background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the natural tree background seen in Image A rather than replacing it with a panel made of green LEGO bricks. The foliage is not depicted through a construction of LEGO elements, thus maintaining a realistic backdrop against the LEGO-styled tank.",
