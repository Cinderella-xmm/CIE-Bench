      "question": "Is the room visually transformed into a thematic infographic with Victorian literature elements, including layout and design consistent with an educational or narrative display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the room is styled to represent an educational or narrative display with Victorian literature elements. The entire layout is designed as a thematic infographic with ornate borders, stylized fonts, and a mixture of decorative and textual elements that communicate information in an illustrative way. The presence of text blocks with varied font styles and decorative elements at the corners indicate a transformation into a thematic infographic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the clock face been replaced with a visual representation of a book with animated or implied page-turning motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock does not appear to have a visual representation of a book with animated or implied page-turning motion. The focus is more on a thematic and narrative representation with Victorian stylistic elements rather than a dynamic or animated feature like pages turning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible text snippets on the wallpaper that detail historical milestones in timekeeping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a significant amount of text present, it appears decorative and seems to correlate with the aesthetic style of the infographic. However, it does not specifically present detailed historical milestones in timekeeping but rather contributes to the overall Victorian literary presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the framed artwork above the fireplace now display an image of an ancient sundial instead of a landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a framed object is visible to the right of the clock, displaying what appears to be an ancient timekeeping instrument, possibly a sundial. This suggests the original landscape painting has indeed been replaced with an image related to timekeeping.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock still retains a traditional clock face design, and there is no indication of the hands being replaced with stylized pens. The clock is depicted in a manner aligned with narrative and educational displays but does not feature such a specific modification.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is visibly composed with elegant serif fonts and surrounded by art-nouveau stylistic elements, including flourishes and organic curves. This contributes to the ornamental and narrative aesthetics typical of the Victorian literature theme.",
