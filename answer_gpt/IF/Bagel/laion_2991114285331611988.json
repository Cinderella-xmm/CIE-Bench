      "question": "Is the edited image divided into at least two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it is clearly divided into four distinct panels. Each panel represents a different scene or action involving the cartoon-style figures. This indicates the typical format of comics or illustrations where multiple panels are used to convey different narratives within a single image. The presence of distinct, bordered panels is evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two men in the image transformed into cartoon-style anthropomorphic agents with visible agent-like characteristics (e.g., expressive faces, limbs, spy traits)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe cartoon-style figures that resemble anthropomorphic agents. They have exaggerated facial expressions, distinct limbs, and attire typical of agents, such as formal suits. Their gestures and actions, such as holding devices that resemble communicators, reinforce their characterization as agent-like individuals.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the plaid-patterned tie have a visible watch communicator device, and is there a visual expression of urgency (such as motion lines or an alarmed facial expression)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character wearing the plaid-patterned tie is depicted using a device that looks like a communicator in his hand. The panels show exaggerated facial expressions which can suggest urgency. However, there are no visible motion lines or other explicit indicators of urgency near the tie specifically.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a circular camera lens symbol embedded within the pattern of the tie with the emblem, and is there a visual indication of activation (e.g., glow, red dot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no observed circular camera lens embedded within the pattern of the tie with the plaid design or emblem. The ties appear to have consistent patterns without additional camera lens embedment or activation indications.",

      "question": "Are there thought bubbles present above or near the heads of the anthropomorphized agents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes various speech bubbles around the characters' heads, indicating they are speaking. Thought bubbles, which are typically cloud-like and suggest internal dialogue, are not present. The bubbles in the image are designed to convey spoken words.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B retains the depiction of a lush green field, consistent with the setting in Image A. Despite the stylistic transformation into a cartoon, the outdoor scene featuring greenery aligns with the original photograph's setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text within the speech bubbles in Image B appears in a hand drawn style rather than a crisp, minimalist, sans-serif font. The font matches the cartoon style rather than being clean and minimalistic, emphasizing a fun and informal presentation.",
