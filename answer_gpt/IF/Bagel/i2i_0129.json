      "question": "Has the surfboard been replaced with a giant manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object beneath the surfer is clearly identifiable as a giant manta ray due to its characteristic shape with broad, flat wings and a small tail, which does not resemble a traditional surfboard at all. This observation combined with world knowledge about the appearance of manta rays leads to the conclusion that a surfboard has been replaced with a giant manta ray.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfers' original poses maintained on the manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the surfer's posture appears to be the same, standing upright with a slightly bent knee position, as if maintaining balance on a surfboard. The consistent body position indicates that the surfer's original pose is maintained in the transition from surfboard to manta ray.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image include dreamy atmosphere elements like soft lighting or misty effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clear and vivid visual elements without any indication of soft lighting or misty effects typically associated with a dreamy atmosphere. The lighting appears normal, and the details are sharp without any diffusion or softening effects.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the manta ray depicted as a giant creature beneath the surfer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The manta ray in Image B is illustrated as significantly larger than the human figure, with expansive wings stretching out from either side of the surfer, suggesting it is depicted as a giant creature. This size disproportion aligns with the expectation of a 'giant' manta ray.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the surfer and the manta ray are depicted with clear detail, and their features are easily identifiable. This visibility exists despite the lack of any dreamy atmospheric elements, confirming their clarity and identifiability.",
