      "question": "Is the eagle enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle is depicted inside a transparent enclosure that resembles a glass dome. The dome covers the statue and its base, providing a clear view of the contained elements with reflections typical of glass. Based on this visual information and world knowledge about presentation domes, the eagle appears to be enclosed within a glass dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the eagle appear as a 3D stylized sculpture with sculptural features (e.g., defined form, modeling lines, or material texture)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the eagle as a 3D object with characteristics typical of sculptures, such as defined lines, structured wings, and a texture that resembles sculpted material rather than natural feathers. These cues suggest it is a 3D stylized sculpture.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there miniature swirling clouds located directly under the eagle's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, directly beneath the eagle's wings, there are stylized cloud formations that are small and appear artistically rendered. They mimic swirling clouds and serve as part of the sculpture's thematic display within the dome. This observation aligns with the concept of miniature clouds.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds under the eagleâ€™s wings decorated with visible gold leaf accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature clouds below the eagle are visible, but they do not display any noticeable gold leaf decorations. They appear to be plain, white clouds without any gold embellishments. Thus, the clouds do not have visible gold leaf accents.",

    {

      "question": "Is the base of the display made of polished dark wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B appears to be made of a dark material with a shiny, smooth finish, indicative of polished dark wood. Such bases are commonly used in displays for their elegant appearance. This aligns with a polished dark wooden base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the phrase \"Noble Sky Guardian\" visibly engraved on the base of the display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text visible on the base reads \"Noble Sky Gurdiaiin\". Thus, while there is text present, it does not exactly match \"Noble Sky Guardian\" due to the misspelling or alteration in 'Gurdiaiin'.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appear to be small compass-like motifs on the wooden sections of the display, resembling the style and color of brass compass roses. These add to the nautical or exploratory theme of the display, suggesting their deliberate inclusion as decorative compass roses.",
