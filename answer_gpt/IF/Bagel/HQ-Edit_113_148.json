      "question": "Is the sandcastle rendered as a translucent crystal sculpture with visible facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main object is a crystal-like sculpture with distinct facets, resembling a castle made of crystals. This is noticeably different from an ordinary sandcastle's texture, which would typically be grainy and opaque. Based on the visual cues and the common knowledge of how crystal sculptures look, the castle in Image B is indeed portrayed as a crystal sculpture with visible facets.",

      "question": "Are there soft blue highlights visible on the surface of the crystal castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal castle exhibits light blue highlights which reflect the light in a way that is consistent with how light interacts with crystal surfaces. These highlights give the crystal sculpture a more lively and realistic appearance, suggesting transparency and multi-faceted reflection.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all seashells been replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the base of the crystal sculpture, there are small gemstones in a variety of colors such as green, blue, and pink. These gemstones are polished and not shaped like typical seashells, which would have more organic shapes and textures. This reflects the concept of replacing traditional seashells with gemstones.",

      "question": "Is the ocean depicted as a wave pattern etched into a frosted glass slab rather than flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean is represented as a stylized pattern integrated into the base of the crystal sculpture, resembling etched waves in glass. In contrast to the flowing water seen in natural ocean settings, this depiction uses straight lines and a uniform structure, typical of glass art or etching.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is clearly placed within a transparent display case that has clean edges and is set against a neutral background. This is indicative of a gallery-type presentation, where the focus is on the artwork itself surrounded by minimal distractions.",
