      "question": "Is the entire figure rendered with a dark wood texture resembling an ancient African sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire figure appears to be rendered with a dark wood texture that is characteristic of traditional African sculptures. The wood texture is evident in the markings and the overall color scheme, which is typical of such sculptures. This visual cue matches with knowledge of African art, where wooden sculptures are common.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing depicted as deeply incised carved reliefs rather than fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clothing patterns in Image B appear to be incised into the surface, indicating relief carving rather than fabric. The grooves and depths create a texture that is consistent with carved reliefs, often found in wooden sculptures. This differs from the smooth surface typical of fabric.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the beaded crown and earrings rendered in vivid, painted colors on the wooden surface, standing out from the surrounding carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beaded crown and earrings in Image B are depicted in vivid colors, contrasting sharply with the dark wood texture of the surrounding sculpture. This use of color highlights these accessories, making them stand out visually, a technique often used to draw attention to specific details.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background transformed into low-relief carvings that depict the jungle scene with visible texture and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings are not rendered with low-relief carvings but instead remain a flat, smooth backdrop, which shows no carved texture or depth to represent the jungle scene. This is evident from the uniform background that lacks the cues for relief carving.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there deeply incised, symmetrical, and symbolic motifs present throughout the sculpture consistent with traditional African art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is embellished with deeply incised, symmetrical motifs that have a symbolic quality, reflecting the design elements consistent with traditional African art. The repetition and symmetry of these motifs suggest intentional design choices rooted in cultural symbolism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit a polished, rich finish with subtle highlights and depth, indicating a refined wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B has a polished appearance, with highlights that suggest depth and richness typical of a well-crafted wooden sculpture. This finish adds an element of sophistication to the piece, consistent with a refined wooden art form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the subjectâ€™s facial expression, posture, and overall proportion been preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the blurred face, Image B maintains the subject's posture and overall proportions similar to the original form seen in typical sculptures. However, since the facial expression is obscured, it can't be accurately assessed, but the rest of the features align well with the sculptural transformation.",
