    "Question": "Q1: Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bears have a surface texture that consists of numerous small pieces that resemble tiles, forming a mosaic pattern. This gives the appearance of mosaic figurines and mimics fur texture through the arrangement of these tiles. Recognizing mosaic art typically involves identifying the use of small, colored materials laid out in patterns, and this is evident in the visual cues from Image B.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles that contrast with the mosaic texture of the rest of the bears?",
    "explanation": "The bows in Image B exhibit a different surface texture; they appear shiny and smooth compared to the rest of the bear which has a typical mosaic texture made of smaller tiles. This sort of textural differentiation is common in art for highlighting and emphasizing certain features, creating contrast between the glossy bows and the tiled texture of the bears.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the mosaic bears positioned on a minimalistic white pedestal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base that supports the mosaic bears is distinctly minimalistic and white, indicative of a pedestal.
