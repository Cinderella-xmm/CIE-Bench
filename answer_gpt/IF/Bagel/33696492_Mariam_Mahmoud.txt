    "Question": "Q1: Are the bookshelves now shaped like wooden wings adorned with leaves and positioned as if in flight?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelves are not traditional straight lines but are crafted to resemble wooden structures with rounded and artistic shapes, evocative of wings.
