      "question": "Is the horse visibly composed of distinct 3D puzzle pieces with defined edges separating each section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is housed under a glass dome, and there are puzzle pieces that appear to be falling or floating around it. This indicates that the horse inside might be part of a 3D puzzle theme. However, the surface of the horse does not show defined edges separating each section that would indicate it is composed of distinct puzzle pieces.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the horse enclosed within a wooden-framed display case that has a transparent glass dome covering it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is indeed covered by a transparent glass dome. The base on which the dome rests appears to be wooden, following a natural log theme. This forms a wooden-framed display case with a glass dome covering.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows a horse with floral patterns and puzzle pieces are present around the horse, the patterns on the horse itself are not fragmented to indicate individual puzzle sections. Rather, the patterns seem continuous across the body of the horse.",
