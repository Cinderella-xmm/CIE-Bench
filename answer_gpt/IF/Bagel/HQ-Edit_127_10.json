    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical or dome-shaped structure resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the scene is clearly enclosed within a transparent spherical structure with the visual appearance of a snow globe. This is indicated by the clear, curved surface and the presence of floating snow-like particles inside, which are typical features of a snow globe.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the upper tier display a detailed Paris skyline composed of buildings with metallic textures or finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The upper tier of the edited image (Image B) shows a skyline consisting of structures that appear to be city buildings. However, these buildings have a metallic or silver-like finish rather than resembling a traditional view of Paris. This suggests a stylized or abstract representation rather than a realistic depiction of Paris.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lower tier contain dense, vibrant green vegetation including trees, hedges, and garden elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the lower tier includes a couple of miniature trees, but they are sparse and simplistic, lacking the dense and vibrant green vegetation such as hedges or garden elements. The setup is minimalistic, more typical of a snow globe scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible silvery or white flake-like particles floating between the upper and lower tiers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows silvery or white particles floating throughout the spherical structure, mimicking snowflakes within a snow globe, suspended between the different sections of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the scene feature sculpted cobblestone patterns and classic street lamps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B does show a cobblestone pattern, typical for such decorative bases, but no classic street lamps are visible in this scene. The emphasis is on the snow globe aesthetic with miniatures rather than real-world detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there exactly two Eiffel Towers visible in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are two small-scale Eiffel Tower models within the snow globe. This is a creative play on scale and aesthetics, showing the iconic Paris landmark in a distinctive way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scene exhibit characteristics of a miniature 3D model, such as exaggerated perspective, reduced scale, or model-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Indeed, Image B depicts a miniature 3D model with elements like reduced scale of the Eiffel Towers and other architectural features, as well as textures that give the impression of an artificial, scaled-down representation common in snow globes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
