      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the buildings in the skyline rendered with pixel-patterned or grid-like luminous facades resembling a digital display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings feature facades with a pixelated or grid-like appearance, which are reminiscent of a digital display. This is evident from the way the structures are depicted with distinct geometric shapes and illuminated lines that mimic digital screens. Such designs are commonly associated with digital or electronic interfaces.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings exhibit a glowing or luminescent effect, such as bright edges, internal illumination, or radiant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings have a distinct glowing effect. They are rendered with bright neon colors that outline the structures, creating a luminescent appearance. This effect gives the impression of internal illumination or a radiant glow commonly associated with futuristic or cybernetic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the trees been replaced with glowing, angular, circuit-like structures composed of lines and nodes resembling digital pathways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees have been transformed into angular, circuit-like structures. These designs consist of lines and nodes that resemble electronic circuitry, giving the impression of digital pathways. This change replaces the natural form of trees seen in Image A with a more technologically inspired look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bridge illuminated with vibrant neon lights along its structure, creating a glowing pathway effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge is depicted with vibrant neon lights along its structure. This is evident from the intense, glowing colors that outline the bridge, creating a pathway effect that resembles the bright, continuous illumination found in neon signage or futuristic settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene consistently feature futuristic technology aesthetics, such as digital patterns, glowing elements, and cybernetic design features across buildings, trees, and infrastructure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consistently features futuristic technology aesthetics throughout the scene. This includes digital patterns on the building facades, glowing and luminescent elements across both the buildings and the bridge, and circuit-like designs replacing natural elements like trees. These characteristics collectively create a cybernetic and futuristic atmosphere that departs from the natural and realistic depiction in Image A.",
