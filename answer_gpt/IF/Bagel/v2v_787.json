      "question": "Does the character retain the original facial details and pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters resemble chibi-style figures, which are markedly different from human proportions and details. Chibi figures typically have exaggerated features, and the poses are more stylized compared to the more realistic pose of the person in Image A. Thus, the facial details and pose have been significantly altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character have chibi-like long-legged proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the characters have the exaggerated proportions typical of chibi figures, with a larger head and shorter body and limbs. This indicates that the character does not exhibit long-legged proportions associated with traditional human figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted in a simplified, cartoonish style, with brown-orange blouses and green trousers similar to the original outfit in Image A. One character holds a tablet, but there is no evidence of glasses or specific details on the footwear that indicate chic designer apparel as referred to in high fashion contexts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases outfits that maintain the green and burnt orange color scheme from Image A, which are coordinated and visually appealing, incorporating fashion-forward elements as expected in a stylized representation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is solid, complementing the color scheme of the characters without any gradients or patterns, which enhances the visual focus on the characters and their outfits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the layout have an aspect ratio of 9:16, with \"OOTD\" text at the top, the full-body chibi character on the left, and a breakdown of the outfit and accessories on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has the 'OOTD' text at the top and features full-body chibi characters. The image layout includes both front and back perspectives of the character and accessories, suggesting a design reminiscent of outfit breakdowns. However, this setup does not adhere to a 9:16 aspect ratio as commonly understood, and the elements are side by side rather than adhering strictly to the described layout.",
