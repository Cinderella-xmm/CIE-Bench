      "question": "Does the figurine appear to be made of polished wood, with visible wood grain and a smooth, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's appearance suggests it is crafted from polished wood. This is evidenced by the visible wood grain patterns across its surface, which are characteristic of wooden materials. Additionally, the smooth and reflective surface implies it has been polished, as observed in many wooden sculptures or crafts. The combination of these visual cues points to the use of wood as the primary material.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors on the figurine are expressed through contrasting wood tones. The darker and lighter sections simulate the natural patterns of black and white dog fur, but in terms of wood, these could be variations in stain or types of wood used to represent these tones. The use of contrasting wood tones effectively mimics the fur's color differences.",
