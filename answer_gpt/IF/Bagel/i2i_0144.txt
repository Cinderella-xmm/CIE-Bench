    "Question": "Q1: Has a small flag reading “Fresh” been added on top of the sandwich?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible small flag with the word 'Fresh' inserted on top of the sandwich. This is concluded from the visual cue of the flagpole penetrating through the sandwich, and the flag itself containing the printed text 'Fresh'. Such additions are not typical for an original sandwich without decorations or indicators, suggesting an enhancement for marketing or presentation purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Have the tomato slices been replaced with grilled pineapple slices?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visible slices above the meat layer have a yellow color and display grill marks, which are characteristic of grilled pineapple slices. In contrast, tomato slices, which are red and do not have grill marks, are absent in Image B. This indicates that the substitution of tomato slices with grilled pineapple slices has occurred.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the layers of lettuce and meat unchanged except for the addition of the flag and substitution of the tomato?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of other components, namely the lettuce and meat, appears consistent compared to Image A. The lettuce maintains its green, leafy appearance at the sandwich's base, and the turkey meat retains its light pink color and thickness. The only visible changes are the introduction of the flag and the substitution of tomato slices with grilled pineapple slices. Hence, other layers remain unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the pineapple slices appear grilled, showing char marks or a browned exterior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pineapple slices have visible parallel char marks, indicating that they have been grilled. This grilling process typically results in a browned exterior along the charred sections, differentiating it from regular or fresh pineapple slices. The presence of these marks is strong evidence of grilling.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the flag sit properly on top of the sandwich without disrupting its composition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flag is positioned such that it penetrates through the top bun, anchoring itself without causing the other sandwich components to become disarranged. The flagpole fits snugly, indicating it is balanced and not causing distortion or collapse of the sandwich structure, thereby maintaining its composition properly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
