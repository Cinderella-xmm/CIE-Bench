    "Question": "Q1: Is the woman's head significantly larger than her body, consistent with a cartoon-style character design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's head is designed to be disproportionately larger compared to her body, which is common in cartoon-style characterizations to emphasize certain features and create a playful aesthetic. Cartoons often exaggerate head sizes for stylistic purposes. In comparison to Image A, where the head is proportionate to the body, Image B deliberately enlarges the head for the cartoon effect.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the character have bold black outlines surrounding its entire form, suggesting a soft rubber toy aesthetic?",
