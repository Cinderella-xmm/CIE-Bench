      "question": "Is the cliffside visibly shaped like a mythical titan creature with distinct anatomical features such as a head, body, or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is evidently designed to represent a mythical creature, complete with discernible features like a head, body, and limbs. The overall appearance, along with its armored form, supports identifying it as a mythical titan. Image A shows normal cliffside rock formations without any creature-like attributes. Therefore, Image B's specific anatomical features justify recognizing it as a mythical titan.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the jagged rock formations now resemble segmented armor plating, with moss growing along their edges or crevices as decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the features of the titan include segmented armor plating that appears intricately designed, and there are visible patches of moss decorating these segments. This resembles armor more than naturally occurring rock formations. Image A displays natural cliff rock formations with no such armor-like detail. Thus, in Image B, the rock formations present the appearance of armor segments complemented by moss.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water below the cliff appear as translucent, flowing spectral limbs connected to the titan’s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are flowing spectral elements that resemble translucent limbs, intertwining around the titan, creating a mystical aura. They do not directly appear to connect to water as spectral limbs originating from it. Image A's depiction of water is plain with natural reflections. Thus, in Image B, any reference to water forming spectral limbs is not directly observable in visual interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the small trees arranged in a dense, flowing pattern along the upper part of the titan’s head or neck, resembling a textured mane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper region of the titan's body does not display small trees in a manner that aligns with a textured mane. The appearance of Image B shows the titan with armor and no indication of tree-like elements forming a mane. In contrast, Image A has small trees scattered naturally with no arrangement to suggest a mane on a creature. Therefore, the depiction in Image B lacks the specific dense, flowing tree arrangement resembling a mane.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible carved runes or symbolic markings on the surface of the rock formations forming the titan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, runic or symbolic carved markings are present on the surface, especially visible on objects that appear to be part of the titan's surroundings. Image A lacks such detail on its rock formations, showing purely natural textures. Hence, in Image B, the presence of carved runes or symbolic markings is clearly observable.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the clouds replaced by glowing, twisting spirit-like forms spiraling around the titan’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are definite glowing, twisting forms that appear to be spirit-like or ethereal, encasing and moving around the titan. They create a dynamic illusion of movement and spiritual energy. On the contrast, Image A’s clouds are naturally arranged, typical for a sky scene with no mystic qualities. Thus, Image B distinctly features these spirit-like forms as opposed to clouds.",
