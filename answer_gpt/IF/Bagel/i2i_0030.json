      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fruit platter is prominently displayed in the center of the packaging. By examining it, the fruit pieces such as watermelon, oranges, pineapples, and berries all appear consistent with a typical fruit platter image.

Comparing with Image A shows the same composition and item layout, suggesting that the original image was used without considerable changes.",

      "question": "Have decorative green leaf graphics been added around the fruit platter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surrounding the central fruit platter image are graphical representations of green leaves, complementing the idea of freshness and healthiness associated with fruit. This decorative addition aims to enhance the visual appeal and associates the product with natural elements, which is not present in Image A. This visual modification suggests an intent to make the packaging more attractive.",

      "question": "Does the image reflect a ready-to-eat supermarket packaging style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the fruit platter with added graphic elements like green leaves and product text such as 'DAILY Viitmin-C Ppalte,' which are typical for commercial packaging. Such text indicates branding and nutritional emphasis, common in supermarket-ready packaging. These characteristics distinguish Image B from a simple presentation of fruit, rendering it a representation likely found on supermarket shelves. Unlike Image A, Image B is purposefully styled to convey a packaged product.",

      "question": "Is the background styled with a light green gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background is visually distinct with a light green gradient that extends from top to bottom, adding depth and subtlety to the packaging design. This choice is likely intended to convey freshness and align with the concept of natural produce. Image A, being just a photo of the fruit platter itself, does not feature this design element, highlighting the change made for Image B's packaging presentation.",

      "question": "Are the details and colors of the original fruit platter preserved accurately in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection, Image B presents the fruit platter with vibrant and vivid colors that mirror the original in Image A. The retention of color fidelity in the fruits (such as the red of the watermelons, orange of the oranges, and green of the kiwis) suggests accurate preservation. Despite being part of a new composition, the details maintained their clarity and authenticity as seen in the original image.",
