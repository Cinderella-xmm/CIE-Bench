        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock are positioned within a transparent dome-like structure with snowflake patterns and particles around them. This visual information is consistent with a snow globe, which is typically a transparent sphere encasing a scene, often with faux snow.",

      ],
