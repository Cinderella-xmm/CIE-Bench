      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding elements exhibit clear geometric contours and segmented areas resembling stained glass panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree and surrounding elements are depicted with clear, geometric contours and segmented areas, characterized by the presence of distinct dark lines that mimic the leaded divisions found in stained glass art. This design choice creates a visual appearance similar to stained glass panels, highlighting separate sections filled with flat colors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree’s branches composed of angular, geometric shapes rather than organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree’s branches are designed using angular, geometric shapes. The segments of the branches are formed by straight lines and clear angles, rather than natural, flowing curves. This stylistic choice aligns with a more abstract and geometric approach, akin to stained glass design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the grass rendered in desaturated, low-saturation colors consistent with a muted palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict grass rendered in desaturated or muted tones prominent in the palette. Instead, the overall image presents high-contrast and bright color sections. The grass is abstracted into flat regions of distinct colors, typical of stained glass styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mountains depicted with sharp, angular forms and colored in shades of bronze and teal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are represented with sharp, angular forms and are indeed colored in shades of bronze and teal. This choice of color and form contributes to a stylized interpretation consistent with the stained glass effect, where flat areas are often filled in with distinct colors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient and include visible accentuated lines or decorative patterns that convey vintage elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky does not exhibit a smooth gradient or visible accentuated lines or decorative patterns typical of vintage elegance. Instead, it is part of a stained glass presentation with segmented, solid color zones without texture or gradient effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the elements in the image composed of flat, solid-colored regions bounded by dark, defined lines characteristic of stained glass art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B are composed of flat, solid-colored regions bounded by dark, defined lines, characteristic of stained glass art. This style is achieved through the use of outlined segments filled with single colors, giving an overall impression mimicking stained glass craftsmanship.",
