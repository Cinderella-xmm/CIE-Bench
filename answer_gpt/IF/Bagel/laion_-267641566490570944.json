      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the jagged mountain peaks transformed into ancient dragon spirits with distinct dragon-like features such as heads, limbs, and tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate the presence of a large dragon-like creature, positioned among the mountain peaks. The creature has a distinct head with dragon-like features such as sharp horns, glowing serpentine eyes, and visible scales along its body. These features are characteristic of a dragon spirit. No peaks in Image B resemble mountain peaks due to this transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mountain surfaces feature visible rocky scales that mimic dragon skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the dragon creature is characterized by scales covering its surface, reflecting the texture commonly associated with dragon skin. However, the mountain surfaces themselves do not exhibit these features, as they remain rocky and unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spines of the dragon-shaped mountains covered in moss-like vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the dragon creature with spines that are more metallic and scaly in appearance, and there is no visible moss-like or vegetation coverage on these areas. The dragon's spines contrast with typical moss-covered mountain surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tallest mountain peak reshaped into a dragonâ€™s head with clearly visible crystal horns and serpentine eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's head is positioned prominently among the mountains, effectively reshaping the landscape around it. The head features sharp, crystal-like horns and serpentine, glowing eyes, distinct from the natural mountain peaks in Image A. The tallest peak has indeed been transformed to resemble the head of a dragon.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the mountain ridges extend into sinuous, snake-like bodies that fade into the mist, with sections resembling coiled limbs or tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon is positioned in such a way that its body naturally continues into the mist, with sections appearing sinuous and resembling a coiled tail. The body fades into the mist, mimicking the way a snake-like dragon would interact with the atmosphere, unlike regular mountain ridges in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the dragon-shaped mountains blend seamlessly into the surrounding misty, atmospheric environment without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows the coloration and atmospheric qualities blending smoothly into the dragon's form. The dragon's body has integration into the misty environment without abrupt visual transitions, ensuring a seamless blend with the surrounding scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the overall lighting and atmospheric quality (such as warm glow, mist, and layered depth) preserved from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the overall atmospheric quality with warm glow and misty layers is indeed preserved. The lighting remains consistent with a layered depth, highlighting the environmental continuity in both images with modifications primarily involving the addition of a dragon figure.",
