      "question": "Has the winding dirt path been transformed into a dragon-shaped form that follows the same route across the hill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central aspect of the scene is a dragon interwoven with the path of the hill. The dragon's body is shaped and positioned in such a way that it resembles the winding path in Image A, maintaining the contour and directionality of the original path. By comparing both images, it is evident that the path has been creatively transformed into the dragon's body.",

      "question": "Are emerald green scales visibly covering the body of the dragon along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon has a detailed and vivid depiction with emerald green scales covering its long, snake-like body, which follows the alignment of the path seen in Image A. The distinct emerald color and scaling pattern are clear indicators of this transformation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are fiery orange markings present along the dragon’s body, following the path’s trajectory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that along the dragon's body, there are fiery orange markings which provide contrast against the emerald green scales. These orange markings are distinctly visible and run along the pathway that forms the dragon's body, enhancing the visual dynamic of the dragon.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dragon have horns that twist and resemble the shape of natural shorelines or coastal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon is depicted with horns that twist and curve. However, they do not distinctly resemble shorelines or coastal edges; rather, they follow a more abstract, fantastical design typical of mythical dragons.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the dragon with two prominently bright, jade-colored eyes on its head. These eyes stand out due to their particular shade and luminous quality, giving the impression of gleaming, which contributes to the dynamic and mythical nature of the dragon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, emanating from the dragon's neck area are tendrils that resemble vines or moss, adding a naturalistic and organic element to the dragon's otherwise mythical appearance. These vine-like structures enhance the visual complexity of the dragon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon's face in Image B displays features that might suggest intelligence, with its almond-shaped eyes and slight curvature of the mouth line. However, the expression leans more towards a typical fierce dragon look rather than one of calmness or serenity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding natural elements such as the trees, hills, distant mountains, and overcast sky remain visible and largely unaltered. The dragon is the primary alteration to the image, without changing the landscape's other features.",
