    "Question": "Q2: Does the right-side skier cast a shadow that suggests depth and closeness to the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier casts a more defined shadow on the snow, which extends toward the viewer. This shadow presence, combined with how shadows generally work by being more prominent when closer to the ground or an object, suggests depth and a sense of proximity to the viewer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier is significantly blurred compared to Image A. This blurring effect simulates motion, as it mimics how rapidly moving objects appear to the human eye or in camera captures. The blur effect highlights the skier's speed and dynamic motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier appears larger and more prominent, indicating that the skier has been repositioned closer to the viewer. By analyzing both images, we observe the increased size and forward placement in Image B, suggesting this adjustment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier appears to be at a more pronounced angle, leaning towards the slope with greater forward inclination. This positioning, coupled with the skier's large presence and motion blur, suggests movement and a perspective that indicates they are coming towards the viewer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
