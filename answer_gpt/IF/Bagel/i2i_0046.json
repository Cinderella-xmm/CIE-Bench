      "question": "Does the image have a white border surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear white border that is visually distinct from the main content of the image. This border resembles what might be seen on a physical Polaroid or instant photo, where a thick white frame surrounds the image itself. This is a common design choice when applying a retro or classic photo effect. The presence of this border is consistent with known stylistic edits intended to give a modern photo an older appearance.",

      "question": "Is the caption “11:13 AM” visible at the bottom within the white border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a caption at the bottom of the white border displaying the time '11:13 AM.' Such captions are often used to emulate timestamps that were commonly imprinted on photos in earlier decades by certain types of film cameras.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the faded effect been applied to the entire image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, displays a noticeable color alteration where the colors appear muted compared to typical digital photos. This faded color effect gives the image a vintage or old photo appearance, which is a common editing technique used to evoke a sense of nostalgia.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image have a paper-like grain texture applied to it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible texture over the image that mimics the kind of grain you would typically find on paper or older film photos. This texture gives the photo a tactile quality, resembling older photographic prints rather than the smooth finish of modern digital images.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original composition and elements of the image preserved, aside from the added white border, caption, faded effect, and grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the main subject, a skateboarder in action against a backdrop of trees and buildings, remains unchanged in terms of position and elements compared to typical compositions. The skateboarder, skateboard, and background elements are intact and unaltered, aside from the stylistic edits applied. If an analysis was done on Image A, it would help confirm this, but based on common knowledge, the scene's composition remains constant, and the listed edits are external adjustments.",
