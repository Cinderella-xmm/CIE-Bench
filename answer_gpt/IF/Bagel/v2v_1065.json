      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual depicted is in a highly stylized, animated manner.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character elevated above the skateboard, with both feet positioned as if executing a trick. The context of being inside a snow globe gives additional charm and focus to the moment captured as a trick in progress, supported by visual cues of motion and action typical in skateboarding.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside Image B, there are small, white particles dispersed in the globe, resembling the classic appearance of snow in snow globes. This visual indication confirms the presence of simulated snowfall creating an enchanting atmosphere inside.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is shown resting on a surface that resembles a table. The background suggests a blurred view through a window, but it does not distinctly resemble a skate park. The emphasis seems to be more on the interior scene rather than an outdoor setup.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to have bright spots and gleams reflective of light interacting with a glass object such as a snow globe. These highlights are indicative of rays filtering through, providing a radiant look consistent with sunlight or indoor lighting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the original background of a skate park in Image A is replaced with a more intimate setting involving a snow globe scene on a table, as seen in Image B. This change replaces the outdoor environment with an indoor, fantastical setup.",
