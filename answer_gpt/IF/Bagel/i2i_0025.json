      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a hand-painted watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is rendered in a manner that resembles a hand-painted watercolor style. The colors are soft, with a mix of gradient washes and linework that mimics watercolor painting techniques. This is evident throughout the image, including the background and the figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the foreground woman depicted in greater detail compared to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground woman in Image B appears to be rendered with similar levels of detail as the rest of the image. While there is a focus on her due to her position and size in the composition, the level of detail does not significantly differ from the other elements, which are all uniformly presented in the painted style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background figures represented with light-colored linework and faint washes rather than detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background figures in Image B are depicted with a consistent style that includes light-colored linework and faint washes, characteristic of a watercolor painting. This style naturally leads to a less detailed rendering compared to more realistic or finely detailed depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Does the woman appear to be elegantly raising her glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman in the foreground is holding her glass in a manner that can be described as 'elegant.' The positioning of her hand and the subtle posture indicate a typical gesture of raising a glass, often associated with elegance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition structured so that the foreground woman is the central point of attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B places the woman in the immediate foreground and significantly larger than the background figures. This positioning naturally draws the viewer's attention to her, making her the focal point of the image.",
