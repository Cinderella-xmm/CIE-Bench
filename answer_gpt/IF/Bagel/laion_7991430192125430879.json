      "question": "Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle appears to be constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, including realistic glass-like elements that are actually LEGO pieces shaped like bottles. The visual cues indicate the bottle is entirely LEGO, particularly by how LEGO bricks are distinctly used for design elements. This suggests no traditional glass or plastic materials are present.",

      "question": "Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the bottle predominantly in green, and the material used appears translucent, suggesting it is constructed using translucent green LEGO bricks. This is evident through the shade and transparency of LEGO bricks forming the bulk of the bottle.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle label is crafted using multicolored LEGO bricks. These LEGO blocks include various colors and shapes that imitate the original design elements like logos and text effectively. This indicates the label utilizes LEGO bricks to represent these design aspects.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cap that is constructed from blue LEGO bricks with a smooth appearance, consistent with the circular and cylindrical shape often associated with LEGO pieces. Hence, the cap maintains its cylindrical form using blue LEGO bricks.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, brand texts such as \"Bacardi\" and \"Mojito\" are depicted using LEGO-style lettering, where individual letters appear blocky due to the LEGO bricks used. They remain visually legible, showcasing the adaptability of LEGO bricks for text rendering.",
