      "question": "Has the central touchscreen been transformed into expressive calligraphic strokes and graded ink washes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central touchscreen appears to display a pattern that resembles free-flowing strokes, akin to calligraphy, and ink washes often seen in traditional art forms. This transformation indicates an artistic alteration where technology is intertwined with a classical visual style. Image B visually distances itself from a straightforward display of digital interfaces, suggesting expressive elements typical of calligraphy.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a display where the interface and representation of airflow are no longer discernible and have transformed into flowing, artistic strokes reminiscent of calligraphy.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region where there is typically dark wood paneling now appears like it has bold, freehand strokes. This suggests an alteration to a more expressive, artistic style, characteristic of freehand brushwork, replacing the standard wooden aesthetic.",
