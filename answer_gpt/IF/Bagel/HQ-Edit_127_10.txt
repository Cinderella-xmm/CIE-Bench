    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical or dome-shaped structure resembling a snow globe?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the scene is clearly enclosed within a transparent spherical structure with the visual appearance of a snow globe.

    "Question": "Q2: Does the upper tier display a detailed Paris skyline composed of buildings with metallic textures or finishes?",
    "explanation": "The upper tier of the edited image (Image B) shows a skyline consisting of structures that appear to be city buildings.
