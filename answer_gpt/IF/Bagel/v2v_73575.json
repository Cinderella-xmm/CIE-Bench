      "question": "Is the bird on the left depicted as an animated origami figure with visible star chart patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the left is depicted as an animated origami figure with distinct geometric patterns, typical of origami art. However, there are no visible star chart patterns on this bird. The judgment is based on recognizing the faceted, folded paper-like appearance consistent with origami without apparent celestial patterns.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both birds in Image B are depicted as perched on large, ivory chess pieces that resemble rooks. These chess figures are shown with elaborate carvings typical of chess set design. The perspective and scale give them a colossal appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing the postures in Image B, the birds are presented in a static and artistic manner, representative of crafted figures rather than living entities. The original Image A depicts live birds in natural poses. Given these differences in artistic representation and dynamic posture, the placement and expression appear altered.",
