      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pyramid's steps visibly transformed into segmented, armored body parts resembling a mythical creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steps of the structure appear much thicker and substantial, resembling the segmented parts of an armored creature, characterized by their curvature and ornamentation with natural elements. This is in contrast to typical pyramid steps which are straight and flat, suggesting an artistic transformation to appear as body parts of a creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original entrance of the pyramid replaced with a mystical eye featuring an iris and pupil, positioned centrally at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent eye with a detailed iris and pupil in the central top area, which is not typical for pyramid architecture. Generally, pyramids have traditional openings or entrances that are rectangular or door-like rather than circular or eye-shaped. This transformation indicates a deliberate replacement with a mystical eye element.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the surrounding jungle been transformed into detailed, interconnected vine-like scale patterns covering the ground and vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding area includes elaborate vine-like structures that appear to intertwine and integrate with the building, giving a sense of interconnected scale patterns, which is different from the natural jungle growth seen in Image A. This transformation emphasizes decorative vine patterns.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the base of the creature display visible ancient stone patterns such as glyphs, carvings, or geometric designs consistent with the temple’s style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B features stone patterns that bear resemblance to ancient carvings or glyphs common in temple architecture. Despite the transformation, these elements are evident and consistent with the temple's style of intricate stone work.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing plants or flowers around the creature that resemble or are inspired by architectural features of the pyramid, such as stepped forms or symbolic carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes glowing plants or flowers situated around the pyramid, reflecting a fantastical element. Although these plants don't exactly mimic architectural features like steps or carvings, their integration into this fantastical setting suggests an inspiration from symbolic imagery to enhance mythical ambience.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire structure transformed into a cohesive, mythical guardian creature with all elements (armor, eye, scales, base, flora) harmoniously integrated to create a strong fantastical impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B seamlessly integrates various elements—such as armored steps, a mystical eye, vine-like scales, and decorative stone patterns—to redefine the architecture as a mythical guardian creature. This transformation results in a cohesive, fantastical impression, contrasting starkly with the traditional pyramid structure in Image A.",
