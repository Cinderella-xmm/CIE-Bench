    "Question": "Q1: Does the robot feature streamlined, symmetrical forms with chrome or highly reflective metallic surfaces typical of Art Deco design?",
    "explanation": "The robot in Image B is depicted with angular, symmetrical forms, characteristic of Art Deco design. While Image A shows a realistic robot with chrome surfaces reflecting light, Image B transforms this into a more abstract representation. The robot's design in Image B leans towards stylized, geometric patterns seen in Art Deco, which often includes reflective surfaces, although the reflection is more implied by the design than directly depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the flamingos depicted as stylized geometric patterns rather than realistic birds?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingos are presented as geometric shapes composed of various polygons creating abstract forms rather than attempting realism. Their design is consistent with a stylized approach, emphasizing shapes and colors typical of Art Deco artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the palm trees in the background have angular, geometric forms instead of natural, curved shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B features palm trees that are represented with angular and stylized geometric forms, contrasting with the natural curved shapes of palm trees seen in Image A. This stylistic change aligns with the Art Deco aesthetic of emphasizing geometric and streamlined forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the rocks in the background rendered with stylized, geometric shapes rather than natural rock formations?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire scene rendered in a muted pastel color palette, avoiding strong or vibrant hues?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the robot positioned centrally among the flamingos, maintaining the original compositional layout?",
    "explanation": "In both images, the robot is placed centrally among the flamingos, maintaining a similar compositional layout. The robot's central position serves as the focal point amidst the surrounding elements in both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
