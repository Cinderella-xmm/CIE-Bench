    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cat's body now composed of a fluffy, mist-like substance with a sky-blue hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the relevant object is made of cloud-like structures and has a sky blue hue, suggesting a transformation to a misty, ethereal form. This description fits the characteristic of a mist-like substance with a sky-blue hue.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the knitted cap been replaced with a swirling cumulus cloud cluster on top of the cat's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no longer a knitted cap visible. Instead, there is a cloud-like structure present, which can be interpreted as a swirling cumulus cloud cluster based on its wispy and fluffy texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible cloud-like patterns woven into the cat’s misty body, such as soft streaks or wisps resembling fog or cirrus clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows features that include soft streaks and wisps within the prominent cloud-like structure, which align well with descriptions of fog or cirrus clouds. As such, this indicates that cloud-like patterns are integrated into this structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts structures that resemble wings made of a translucent material with swirling patterns, commonly associated with cloud or ethereal wing depictions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object's design does not contain any discernible eyes or eye patterns as typical in animal representations, nor does it feature any swirling patterns that could be interpreted as breezes or vapor on what would be considered the eye region.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any vapor trails extending along or from the structure. The forms are more cohesive and do not display the typical characteristics of trailing vapors from limbs or tails.",
