      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements of the buildings have been simplified and stylized with sharp and angular edges, which are characteristic of a paper-cut art style. This involves clean lines and distinct shapes, aligning with the aesthetic of paper-cutting. Observing the straight lines and geometric shapes throughout the illustration confirms this style choice.",

      "question": "Are the window frames and plant motifs enhanced with visible gold foil-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window frames and some plant motifs are depicted with a shimmering gold color that mimics the look of gold foil. This is evident in the shiny texture and distinct golden hue used in these areas, suggesting an embellishment characteristic of gold foil detailing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the entrance awning colored in a bold crimson hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entrance awnings in Image B are indeed colored in a bold and vibrant red, which is similar to a crimson hue. The intensity and richness of the red suggest a deliberate choice to use a striking shade, aligning with the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background of each postcard rendered with a textured cream-colored paper appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In observing Image B, the background for each illustrated building appears to have a creamy hue. However, instead of being a plain color, there is a texture visible, akin to that of textured paper, providing a classic aesthetic often used in physical postcards to enhance their tactile appeal.",

      "question": "Does each postcard feature a geometric arch border around its edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that each postcard features a distinct border along its edge. These borders are geometric in nature, forming an arch-like pattern around the cards, providing a formal and visually structured boundary that frames the central illustration of each postcard.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the postcards presented without any visible frame or border, maintaining a clean, borderless edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Contrary to the question, Image B clearly shows that the postcards each have a visible border around them. These borders provide a structured boundary for each illustration, so the postcards are not presented as borderless.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays three distinct illustrated postcards, each featuring a different variation of a building with a similar architectural style, likely intended to depict the same hotel in different renditions. The presence of three separate illustrations confirms this.",
