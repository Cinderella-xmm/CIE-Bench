      "question": "Are the outlines of the clock tower and surrounding elements strong and well-defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the clock tower and the surrounding elements are distinctly marked, which gives a clear and defined appearance. This is typical of cartoon or illustration styles where strong outlines help differentiate objects and structures from each other and the background. This is evident from the dark lines seen separating the clock tower from the sky and ground around it.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features vibrant and bright colors, such as the pink and yellow tower, bright red roof, and the cyan sky. This use of strong, bright colors is typical in animated or stylized illustrations designed to catch attention and evoke a sense of vibrancy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textures in the image simplified yet sufficient to identify the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, textures are minimized, focusing on flat, bright colors with well-defined outlines. Despite this simplification, the clock tower and its features, such as arches and clock faces, as well as the circular road and cars, remain easily identifiable. The minimalist approach does not compromise recognition due to its stylistic emphasis on shape and outline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrations in Image B maintain the essential structural features of the clock tower, including its height, clock positions, and general architectural style. This implies that even with the stylization, key aspects needed to identify the structure have been retained, such as the clock faces and tiered components of the tower.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a lively cartoon style, characterized by the combination of distinct, strong outlines, a palette of vivid and bright colors, and minimal textures. The image focuses on bold color blocks and prominent outline features to bring a sense of cheerful animation typical of cartoon aesthetics.",
