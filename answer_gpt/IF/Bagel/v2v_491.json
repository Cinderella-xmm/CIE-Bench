        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a bear figure with exaggerated, rounded features typical of toy or cartoon designs. The surface lacks the intricate details of real fur, indicating smooth textures and a simplistic design approach. The appearance is more stylized without realistic detailing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bear figure have emotive eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure's eyes are large, round, and expressive, a common trait found in cartoon characters to convey emotions. These features suggest that the eyes are designed to elicit an emotional response, often seen in anime or animated figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bear figure on a flat, wood-like surface that resembles the typical top of a desk or table. The context and other items in the image lead to the conclusion that it is placed on a desk.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a realistic, scaled-down model of the backpack included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backpack in Image B matches the stylized and smooth characteristics of the bear figure. While it resembles a real backpack in shape, it lacks realistic detail and scale typically found in true-to-life models, indicating it is not designed to be a realistic scaled-down version.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the scene have a casual, natural vibe, as if captured using a smartphone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a highly stylized and artificial scene, where the elements appear smooth and cartoon-like, deviating from natural appearances. Such a scene is typically not associated with casually captured, naturalistic smartphone images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bear figure seamlessly combine lifelike textures with distinctive Japanese anime-style elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bear with distinctly anime-style eyes and smooth, stylized surfaces typical of animated or toy design. The absence of lifelike textures such as detailed fur means it does not combine these with anime elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
