      "question": "Is the facade of the theater building constructed from visible tan LEGO bricks with brown accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the theater indeed appears to have a texture and pattern typical of LEGO construction. The walls are a tan color with distinguishable seams and edges simulating LEGO bricks. The accents and design elements, especially around windows and structural edges, are brown, complementing the tan background, which is typical of the color schemes used in LEGO sets for a similar aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO pieces arranged in a grid pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows in Image B have visibly changed in appearance compared to standard building materials. They have a pattern resembling translucent LEGO pieces arranged in a grid. In contrast to typical glass windows from the original image, LEGO builds often use such patterns to suggest window panes, supporting the observation that these windows are made from LEGO-like pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the marquee signs for \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" rendered using smooth red flat LEGO bricks to form the letters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marquee signs in Image B have a detailed, smooth appearance; however, they do not show visible characteristics typical of LEGO constructions, such as the studs or modular build lines. The text appears more like typical signage rather than constructed from LEGO-style bricks, suggesting a deviation from LEGO aesthetics when it comes to lettering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles, one in black and one in purple, with angular, modular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars have an altered presentation compared to their realistic appearance in Image A. They display a clear, blocky, and modular appearance, reminiscent of LEGO vehicle construction. One vehicle is predominantly black, and the other is purple. Both have angular, less detailed shapes characteristic of LEGO toys, differing from the detailed and realistic design of vintage cars seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene—including the building, cars, and signage—appear as a cohesive, playful, miniature LEGO model with consistent blocky textures and toy-like proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The alterations in Image B give the building and vehicles a blocky structure typical of a LEGO model. The scene, while maintaining real-world scale, closely mirrors a miniature model in its playfulness and texture, though not all elements, like the sign lettering, are perfectly LEGO-like. However, considering the primary components—facade, windows, and vehicles—the transformation into a LEGO-like model is coherent and evident.",
