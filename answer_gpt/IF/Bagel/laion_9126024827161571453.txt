    "explanation": "The second image (Image B) features three robot characters in a dynamic and stylized pose, typical of comic book cover designs.

    "explanation": "In Image B, there are three robot characters that are designed with human-like features such as arms, legs, and heads.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the title 'Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!' prominently displayed in a bold, comic-style font at the top or center of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title appears to be 'DURACELL GRADÅNS', continuing with fictitious stylized text. While it does feature a bold and comic-style font, the full and specific title 'Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!' does not appear.
