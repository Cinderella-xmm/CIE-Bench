      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's representation has the distinct features of a soft vinyl figure, such as its smooth surface, simplified proportions, and stylized appearance indicative of collectible figures made from vinyl. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge about collectible figures, it can be concluded that the character is depicted as a soft vinyl figure.",

      "question": "Is the character standing on a black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character positioned above a flat, black platform, which serves as a base. The presence of such a base is typical for figures, especially vinyl ones, to provide stability and display presentation. This visual detail leads to the conclusion that the character is indeed standing on a black base.",

      "question": "Are weapons included as interchangeable accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with a small, simplistic firearm held in its hand, characteristic of soft vinyl figure accessories that could be interchangeable. However, without direct visual evidence of additional accessories or known interchangeable parts, there's insufficient information to conclude definitively whether the weapon is interchangeable. Without more detail indicating multiple accessories, the most reasonable judgment is that the weapon is part of the figure's fixed design, not interchangeable.",

      "question": "Are different hand gestures included as interchangeable accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's figure in Image B shows a specific hand position holding a weapon, but it doesn't provide visual cues of additional interchangeable hand gestures, nor any indicators of accessorization allowing for varied hand positions. Thus, the evidence suggests there are no interchangeable hand gestures included.",

      "question": "Does the soft vinyl figure retain recognizable character features from Image A?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image A and Image B, the key identifiable features such as the characterâ€™s costume design, color scheme, and red curly hairstyle remain consistent between the realistic portrayal in Image A and the stylized version in Image B. Despite simplification typical for vinyl figures, these features provide clear recognition of the character across both images.",
