      "question": "Is the Aquatic warrior rendered as a three-dimensional model rather than a flat 2D image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B suggest that the Aquatic warrior is indeed a three-dimensional model. This is evidenced by the shading and lighting that give the figure distinct depth and volume, characteristics unique to 3D objects. Additionally, the presence of a dome and a base provides a real-world context more associated with three-dimensional models than with flat images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior enclosed within a dome that features marine-themed decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior is enclosed within a transparent dome, and marine-themed decorations, such as coral-like structures, can be seen surrounding the figure within this enclosure. These details support the conclusion that the dome is designed with a marine aesthetic in mind.",

      "question": "Is the armor of the Aquatic warrior rendered in metallic blue tones with visible reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor in Image B is distinctly blue with metallic sheen, indicated by visible highlights and reflections on the surface. This gives the armor a polished, reflective appearance typical of metallic materials, suggesting it is rendered in metallic blue tones.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the trident maintain its large, dominant size and detailed structure relative to the Aquatic warrior's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trident in Image B is depicted as large and carries a detailed structure relative to the figure of the Aquatic warrior. Its size and prominence in relation to the body suggest it maintains the grand scale and intricate design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the 3D model placed on a base that resembles a coral reef made of artificial or stylized coral structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base on which the 3D model stands includes structures that resemble coral, suggesting it is designed to mimic a coral reef. These features are clearly stylized, consistent with a crafted or artificial representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there swirling, miniature water currents visible around the figure, suggesting dynamic movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Around the model's base in Image B, there seem to be swirling designs that mimic the appearance of water currents. These suggest an element of dynamic movement, giving the impression that water is swirling around the figure.",
