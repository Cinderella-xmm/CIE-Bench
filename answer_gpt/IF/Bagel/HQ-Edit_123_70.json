    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image split into two distinct panels, one on the left and one on the right (or top and bottom), forming a comic layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing the edited image, it's evident that it is divided into two clear segments. The presence of different visual elements and text in each section supports the conclusion of a panel-based layout, similar to a comic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 show the bear wearing spectacles and displaying a wise or thoughtful facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Panel 1 depict a bear that is anthropomorphized, wearing spectacles, which often symbolize wisdom or intelligence. The facial expression also aligns with thoughtful or wise demeanor typically seen in educational comics or illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text: “Ever wondered how a salmon ends up in a bear's mouth?”",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Panel 1 does contain text, but it's not in an intelligible language, and it doesn't precisely match the phrase provided. Thus, the specific text is not present as described in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does Panel 2 show a salmon emerging from bubbling water into a visual chart with labeled stages: 'egg', 'fry', 'smolt', 'adult'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 features a stylized depiction of a fish alongside text elements, but upon inspection, it does not present a clear chart or the specific life stages of salmon as described.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a fact box in Panel 2 containing the text: “Journey's end in the river gives life to the forest.”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is significant text present in Panel 2, however, the statement in question does not appear within it. The box contains different wording not matching the described fact box text.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all text elements (speech bubble, labels, fact box) rendered in a clear, modern sans-serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the text elements, they appear stylized with non-standard formatting and are not rendered in a clear, modern sans-serif font, exhibiting more of a comic or artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the water elements in Panel 2 depicted in blue hues and the forest background in Panel 1 shown in brown-green tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water in Panel 2 is indeed illustrated with blue hues, and the forest in Panel 1 uses tones that include browns and greens, which aligns with natural colors used in forest scenes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the overall image have an aspect ratio of 16:9?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Determining the aspect ratio from the visual examination of the image without specific dimensions can be challenging, but the layout does not noticeably conform to the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the visual content of both panels clear, logically connected, and suitable for educational purposes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the image has an educational theme with the bear and salmon, the lack of clear text and non-standardized imagery may affect its suitability for straightforward educational content.",
      "weight": 1,
