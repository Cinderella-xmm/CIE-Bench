      "question": "Is the elephant depicted as a smaller-scale version enclosed within a transparent glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is visible inside a clear display case with evident corners and edges. This setup suggests that the figure is a scaled model, reflecting a miniaturized version inside the glass case. The placement within this case clearly indicates a smaller-scale representation, different from a real-sized elephant. The visual clues of the glass edges, along with common knowledge about display cases, lead to the conclusion that the elephant is depicted in a smaller scale within a glass display case.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate armor details on the elephant rendered with a shiny, metallic-resin-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor details on the elephant in Image B display a sheen and reflective quality commonly associated with metallic textures. These visual characteristics align with the shiny, resin-like perception often used to simulate metal in model design. Through observation, the armor's reflectivity and surface texture resemble metallic and resin surfaces typically found in model construction, leading to the conclusion that these details are rendered in that texture.",

      "question": "Are there four small golden banners made of silk-like material positioned at each corner of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only two small banners are visible attached to the inner corners of the display case. These banners have a flowing appearance suggestive of silk. However, they do not appear at each corner; instead, they are only visible on the left side of the case, contrary to being on all corners. Consequently, not all four corners have banners, leading to the conclusion that the answer is no.",

      "question": "Does the background feature multiple layers of mountains with translucent, soft-edged silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a backdrop with mountain shapes painted or depicted without intricate detailing, characterized by smooth and softened edges, giving a translucent appearance. These silhouettes behind the transparent case depict layered mountain forms, creating depth through artistic simplicity. Compared to Image A, where the mountains are detailed and realistic, Image B's are intentionally less defined and more stylized. Based on this observation, the background indeed features layers of soft-edged mountain silhouettes.",

      "question": "Are there small, stylized bonsai-like trees placed along the foreground edges of the display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two small trees resembling bonsai are visible within the display case on either side of the elephant. Their form and placement within the foreground as decorative elements imply an intentional bonsai-like styling, typical in small-scale showcases. Using the visual cues and knowledge of bonsai aesthetics, Image B indeed features stylized bonsai-like trees within the display.",
