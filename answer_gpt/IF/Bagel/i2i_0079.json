      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a scene with a small, stylized black dresser with a round mirror and decorations that seem to be miniature in scale.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting appears to be a small-scale scene with a black dresser that has the appearance of a desk ornament or tabletop decoration due to its miniature perspective.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The items in Image B, including the miniature dresser, mirror, and vase arrangement, are coordinated in terms of color and style, which contributes to a sense of visual harmony within the scene.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scale and arrangement of the items are such that no single element dominates or obstructs others within the scene. Each element, including the miniature vase, books, and mirror, has its own space and visibility. The design intent seems to be to showcase each item without overshadowing any element, maintaining clear visibility and focus.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure setup is designed with a consistent aesthetic that suggests it is a natural aspect of the scene. The scale, colors, and stylized objects convey a unified decorative theme. All elements appear purposefully arranged to create a cohesive miniature scene, indicating harmonious integration within the composition.",
