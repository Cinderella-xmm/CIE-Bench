        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Breathe' is clearly visible in large, bold letters at the top left corner. This placement at the top left is typical for adding noticeable text to an image, particularly when aiming to convey a positive or motivational message. The positioning helps the text stand out and immediately registers with viewers.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes the word 'Calm' in a similar font and style to 'Breathe,' located in the bottom right corner.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Breathe' and 'Calm' in Image B uses a bold, rounded font in a deep green color, which is often associated with nature, calming environments, and wellness themes. The size is large enough to be readable without dominating the image, aligning with themes common in plant therapy and meditation, where tranquility and nature play key roles.",

      "question": "Do the added texts \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" blend well with the plant and window setting, maintaining the calming atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added texts in Image B are carefully positioned and colored to integrate seamlessly with the plant and window scene. By using a natural deep green tone and placing the text in non-obtrusive spots, the design maintains the calming, serene atmosphere intended by the plant's visual. The harmony in color choice and positioning supports the intended soothing theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the texts \"Breathe\" and \"Calm\" positioned in a way that does not obscure the central visual elements of the plant and window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' in Image B is such that neither text encroaches upon the central visual elements of the plant or the window. By being positioned at the top left and bottom right, the texts frame the plant rather than overlap it, ensuring that the main visuals—namely, the plant and light from the window—remain clear and unobstructed, preserving the focus of the image.",
