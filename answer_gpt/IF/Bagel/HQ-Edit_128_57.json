      "question": "Has the entire scene been reimagined as a vintage stationery set packaging design rather than a realistic library interior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts elements typical of a vintage stationery set. The items are framed in a wooden box - a notebook, ink bottle, and a stylized quill, complete with classical motifs and design elements reminiscent of antique aesthetics. In contrast, Image A reflects a library interior with books on shelves and an ornate desk with an open book. Thus, Image B is configured less like an interior and more like a boxed stationery set.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ornate desk styled as a decorative box base with visible embossed wood textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate desk from Image A is no longer present; instead, we see a stationery box with compartments, which includes a textured wooden base, suggesting an embossed design. This contrasts with Image A, where an intricately carved desk is visibly part of a library setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the open book been replaced with a writing pad made of antique-style paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a rectangular object resembling an antique-style notebook or writing pad that occupies the space where the open book was previously seen in the library setting of Image A. The stylized cover and classical emblem on the writing pad emphasize its antiquated inspiration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the quill depicted as a gold foil embossed logo on the packaging or box surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a quill that looks like an actual object rather than just a part of the box surface. Despite the box design, thereâ€™s no distinct evidence of it being an embossed logo; it is placed as part of the arrangement in the box. Contrasting with Image A, where the quill is in an inkwell on the desk.",

      "question": "Is there a small ink bottle placed on top of the desk or packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a small ink bottle set into the packaging, similar to how one might place it atop a desk for use. This is distinct from Image A's scene, where no ink bottle is present on the desk.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible branding or detailed etching along the spine of the writing pad. The writing pad has a classical design with an emblem, but no striking brand markings are evident. Comparing with Image A, no such branding would apply as it shows a book.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall design convey elegance through refined materials, balanced composition, and classical styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys elegance through the use of refined and classic materials like the luxurious wooden box, ornamental paper aesthetics, and stylized features such as the quill and ink bottle, all arranged in a balanced composition within a boxed display. This assessment is independent of Image A, which conveys a similar elegant aura albeit within the context of a library.",
