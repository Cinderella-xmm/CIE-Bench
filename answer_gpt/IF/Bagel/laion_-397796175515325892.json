      "question": "Has the church been rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified shapes and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is shown with simplified shapes and smooth, stylized lines, resembling a more artistic and cartoon-like interpretation.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the architectural elements of the church perfectly symmetrical on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is depicted in a symmetrical fashion, which is common in idealized or cartoon representations. The simplification and stylized approach ensure that each side mirrors the other exactly, following a common design choice in stylized art to enhance visual appeal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic gold accents applied specifically to the spires and upper parts of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's spires are shown with gold-colored accents, especially noticeable due to their contrast with the dark background. The use of gold coloring suggests a stylized artistic choice, often used to add a sense of elegance and draw attention to certain architectural features.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the proportion of the church been altered to enhance its sense of grandeur and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions appear exaggerated, with the spires elongated and the church presented in an idealized manner. This is a common characteristic in stylized or cartoon drawings to emphasize grandeur without adhering to realistic proportions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a celestial-themed design featuring elements like stars, galaxies, or cosmic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a celestial theme, including stars and crescent moons against a dark sky. This creates a cosmic atmosphere and is part of the overall stylization, shifting away from a realistic setting to one that is more imaginative and symbolic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed three distinct sections or panels, each framed separately in black. This presentation resembles individual art prints, separated for emphasis and stylistic presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the three prints arranged in a trifold album format, with a central fold and two outer panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The three prints in Image B are arranged in a linear fashion rather than a foldable trifold album format. Each print is separately framed, and there is no indication of a central fold or hinge that suggests they can be folded like a trifold album.",
