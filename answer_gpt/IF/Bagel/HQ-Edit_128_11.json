      "question": "Is the image styled as a vintage theater program cover, with a flattened, illustrative appearance resembling a printed poster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image demonstrates characteristics typical of vintage theater program covers, such as the use of a flattened, illustrative style. This is evident from the use of sepia tones, decorative borders, and the stylized depiction of the chandelier and grand piano. This aesthetic is reminiscent of art styles commonly seen in early 20th-century posters, aligning with the notion of a printed program cover.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the chandelier been modified to include additional ornate decorative elements such as scrollwork or intricate metalwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chandelier in Image B retains a simple and elegant design, with no additional ornate decorations or metalwork beyond what is commonly found in such structures. This suggests that no new intricate decorative elements have been added in the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there newly added intricate patterns (such as floral or geometric designs) on the ceiling surface, particularly surrounding the central dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling surface, especially around the central dome, is not visible as it is edited into a poster format, leaving no room for examination of intricate patterns. Therefore, based on the visual representation in Image B, the answer would be negative as it does not show these elements.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all audience members been rendered as solid black or dark silhouettes without visible facial features or clothing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original photograph has been stylized to remove detailed imagery of the audience, replacing them with other aesthetic elements. This does not apply to the question of rendering audience members as silhouettes, as Image B instead uses typography and illustration without depicting the audience.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is presented with a consistent sepia tone throughout, evident from the warm brown and yellow hues that dominate the image. There is a clear emphasis on these colors typical of vintage prints, with minimal contrast from any cooler colors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano appears as a silhouette in the lower part of the image, but is not physically positioned at the center or the foreground. The positioning and design do not prioritize it as the primary focal point, given the dominant text and chandelier above it.",
