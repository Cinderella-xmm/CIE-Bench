        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is fully visible from head to foot, indicating that it is not shown in a half-body form, which would typically mean presenting only the upper half of the body. The full visibility and posture of standing or jumping are clear from the visual information, reflecting that more than just the upper body is displayed. Hence, based on common understanding, the character is not in a half-body form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visual indications of a screen, tablet, or any electronic device. The background is plain white, and there is no frame or technological elements typical of a screen or tablet. There's no visual cue to suggest that the character is interacting with or emerging from such a device. Therefore, the character does not appear to be jumping out of a children’s tablet screen.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character with its arms outstretched, which is commonly associated with a welcoming gesture. This pose is often interpreted as inviting or friendly based on typical nonverbal communication cues. The character's open arms suggest a posture that could be perceived as welcoming.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a character without any interactive elements or context such as digital effects, screen frames, or animation characteristics typically found in interactive media. The presentation is static with a simple white background, not suggestive of interaction or entertainment typically associated with dynamic or multimedia platforms. Therefore, the depiction does not simulate an interactive entertainment effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no tablet or any electronic device presented. The background is plain without any form or pattern that resembles a tablet. Consequently, there are no features such as rounded edges or colorful designs to analyze. As there is no tablet depicted, it does not include attributes typical of children's tablets.",
