      "question": "Is the cityscape and car fully enclosed within a transparent, cube-shaped resin casing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear structure that encloses a miniature scene, which includes the cityscape and a car. This structure is cube-shaped and fully transparent, suggesting that the scene is enclosed within a resin casing. The visual cues like the shiny, reflective surfaces and the rectilinear shape help determine that this casing is indeed fully enclosing the miniature representation within.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car feature a sleek, futuristic design with metallic and highly reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a car that has a smooth, streamlined shape indicative of a futuristic design. The metallic surface is apparent as it reflects light in a way that suggests high reflectivity. The car's overall aesthetic is consistent with modern, high-tech design elements typically described as sleek and futuristic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers visibly reduced in size compared to the original image, enhancing the sense of depth and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers appear smaller and are part of a terrarium-like setup, which naturally reduces their size in comparison to Image A. This intentional scaling down of the skyscrapers in a miniature form is a design choice to enhance depth and scale within the resin cube.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the skyscrapers have small, distinct points of light resembling micro LEDs on their windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays skyscrapers with numerous small, bright lights that dot their surfaces. These resemble micro LEDs commonly used for miniature effects, providing an illusion of lit windows. The distinct and uniform light pattern within the context of a miniature model confirms this feature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, miniature foliage with rich green coloration that contrasts with the surrounding urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are depicted as small, highly detailed models with vibrant green foliage. The scale and detail contrast vividly with the urban structures, indicating precision and attention to detail typical of miniature model trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the resin cube completely transparent with no visible color distortion or opacity, allowing full view of the interior scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the resin cube is fully transparent, allowing a clear view of the scene inside. There is no visible distortion or opacity that might obscure the details within, which confirms the transparency of the resin cube.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the car positioned in the same relative location on the street as in the original image, maintaining its orientation and alignment with the road?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature car is placed within a setup that is not the same as the street setting in Image A. Instead, it is part of a small model environment. Therefore, the car cannot be in the same relative street location, as the entire context has changed from a city street to a replica model environment.",
