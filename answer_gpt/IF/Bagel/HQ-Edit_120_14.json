      "question": "Has the overall form of the bicycle been transformed into a creature-like structure resembling a steampunk insect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall structure resembles an insect-like entity, characterized by features such as wings, a segmented body, and multiple mechanical legs—typical elements found in steampunk art. This denotes a significant transformation from a bicycle to a creature-like structure. The original Image A shows a bicycle in a traditional form, while Image B presents a distinct insect-inspired design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the frame components replaced with an exoskeleton structure featuring visible cogwheel joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a design where the components appear as mechanical segments, with cogwheels and gear-like elements visible, indicative of an exoskeleton structure, which are common in steampunk designs. In Image A, the bicycle frame is more traditional and devoid of mechanical joints or cogwheels, showcasing that Image B underwent substantial modifications.",

      "question": "Has the bicycle seat been transformed into a detailed, ornate carapace resembling an insect's back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain features that directly relate to a seat resembling an insect's back. The transformed object features a rounded, segmented body, reminiscent of insect anatomy, but distinct from a bicycle seat transformation. In Image A, the bicycle seat retains its classic form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have both wheels been replaced with hinged, mechanical leg structures instead of traditional circular wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows mechanical leg structures at the bottom, where traditional wheels would be expected. These legs are designed with joints and segments typical of insect anatomy and mechanical constructs. Image A features traditional circular wheels, confirming a complete transformation in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steampunk insect in Image B features prominent wings with a copper color, featuring intricate detailing typical of steampunk designs. These wings contrast with the bicycle's frame in Image A, which doesn't have any wing-like extensions, confirming the transformation in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features an antique-style clock face as part of the insect's design, integrated within the body, but there’s no indication of mysterious runes. The clock face contradicts the classic bicycle handlebar seen in Image A, suggesting a substantial transformation in the presentation area in Image B.",
