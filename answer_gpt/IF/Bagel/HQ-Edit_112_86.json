    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the main body of the teapot in a transparent material that's characteristic of glass, including visible shine and reflections often associated with clear glass. Based on world knowledge of teapots and glass materials, the main body appears to be made of clear glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the teapot transparent, allowing visibility through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based solely on Image B, the body of the teapot is transparent, demonstrated by the floral patterns and other elements being visible through it. This indicates that the material is clear and allows for visibility through the teapot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the teapot displays frosted floral patterns, which can be determined by the matte appearance typical of frosting. These patterns resemble the original engraved rose and leaves from Image A, suggesting deliberate editing to maintain the motif.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the handle and spout made of tinted amber glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that both the handle and spout of the teapot are composed of colored material that appears to be glass tinted in an amber hue. Drawing from knowledge of glass tinting, the color and glass-like appearance suggest these parts are made of tinted amber glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored surface showing a clear reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a mirrored surface beneath the teapot, as evident from the detailed reflection of the floral patterns and shape of the teapot. This indicates the surface is reflective, providing a clear reflection of the teapot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the teapot retain the same level of detail and design as the original engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A to Image B, the floral patterns in Image B mimic the design and arrangement of the original, suggesting similarities in detail. However, the frosted patterns in the edited image inherently limit the intricate detail seen in the original metallic engravings, where fine lines and shading are more pronounced. This hints at reduced level of detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original shape and proportions of the original metallic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing both images, the teapot in Image B maintains the same structural design and proportions as seen in the original Image A, from body shape to size, which suggests that the editing focused on material change while retaining shape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
