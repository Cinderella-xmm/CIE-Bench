        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall no longer features the large, colorful painting of a sunset scene, which is present in Image A. Instead, a rectangular digital display screen is visible. The absence of the painting in Image B indicates it has been removed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a rectangular digital display screen on the wall showing some cloudy weather imagery, whereas in Image A, there is a painting of a sunset. The presence of this screen in the position where the painting was suggests that the digital display has been added in place of the painting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital display screen in Image B shows graphics with clouds and text that resembles weather symbols, which is typical for weather forecasts or real-time weather updates. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the display is showing weather imagery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the digital display screen is mounted on the wall in the same central location where the painting was originally positioned. Thus, the spatial placement remains unchanged between the painting and the digital display screen.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the removal of the painting and the addition of the digital display screen maintains the general symmetry of the room. The chairs remain symmetrically placed, and the screen occupies a similar visual space as the previous painting. The composition appears balanced as it retains the central wall hanging between the chairs.",
