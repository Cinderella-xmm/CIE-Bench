    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain two distinct panels depicting different scenes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly four distinct sections divided by borders, showcasing different visual scenes and events. This segmentation into four sections inherently indicates multiple panels, though the question asked about two, suggesting there might be some confusion. Given that these are distinct, separate panels telling parts of a narrative, the two-panel form might be part of simplifying the description, but ultimately, Image B does indeed have more than two distinct panels.",
