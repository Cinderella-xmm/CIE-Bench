      "question": "Does the edited image contain multiple distinct postcard-style panels depicting the woman in different dynamic poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition is that of a single stylized illustration on a black slipcase cover, featuring a woman in a red dress and leather jacket. There are no different panels within the single image that show multiple poses; instead, the image is a unified design. The woman is presented in a poster-like format with static elements, not in multiple postcard-style panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red dress and black leather jacket outlined with bold, thick lines and rendered in highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration uses bold, thick lines to define the red dress and black leather jacket, which are rendered in saturated colors typical of stylized graphic designs. The use of strong outlines and bright colors gives it a comic art style as opposed to a realistic depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there at least three different dynamic poses shown—such as walking, looking at neon signs, and browsing shop windows—in the postcard series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, depicts only one central pose of the woman standing in a confident manner holding a handbag. There are no other dynamic poses shown like walking or interacting with environment elements. The image focuses on a single stylized representation rather than a series or collection of different actions or activities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire set of postcards presented within a black slipcase that has a silver foil embossed cityscape design on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B has a black border surrounding the illustration, suggesting it is presented as part of a set, possibly a slipcase cover. However, it lacks visible evidence of a cityscape design embossed with silver foil on the surface. The cityscape is illustrated as part of the drawing but not embossed as a separate design feature on the supposed slipcase.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there comic-style visual elements such as panel borders, speech bubbles, or motion lines present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, comic-style visual elements typical of graphic designs are present, including bold lines defining clothing and scenery. However, traditional comic elements like panel borders, speech bubbles, or motion lines are not found in this image. The portrayal remains an illustration without transitioning into comic-strip storytelling techniques.",
