      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the skier's exact pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the figurine maintains the skier's exact pose, observe the posture and position of the skier in Image B. The skier's body position, the angle of the skis, and the placement of the arms and poles are similar to the real skier's action pose in Image A. Since Image B is a figurine, there might be some constraints on mirroring dynamic poses exactly, but the overall stance aligns with the skier's action. Based on this analysis, the figurine appears to maintain a very similar pose to the original skier.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By inspecting Image B, the figurine is shown without any visible magnetic base or snow powder feature. It is packaged in a blister pack with no indication or appearance of a snow base. Therefore, there is no magnetic snow powder base attached to the figurine.",
