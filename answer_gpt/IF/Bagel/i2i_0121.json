      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a keychain figure with classic chibi traits: an oversized head in relation to its body, resulting in a cute and stylized appearance. This disproportionality is typical in chibi designs, highlighting its distinguishing characteristics.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the character, there is a distinct base resembling a shell. This is evident from the scalloped edges and the depiction of a textured surface resembling a seashell.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even without the face, Image B shows the character wearing a straw hat and a red jacket, matching the elements from Image A. This suggests a causal link to the original design.",
