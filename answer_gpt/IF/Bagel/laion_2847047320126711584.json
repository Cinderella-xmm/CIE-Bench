      "question": "Is the edited image structured as a two-panel comic strip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visualization indicates two distinct sections, or panels, divided horizontally through the incorporation of different scenes. This format is characteristic of a two-panel comic strip where each part tells a part of the story or complements the narrative. The top panel features a conversation or introduction, and the bottom panel progresses the comic narrative.",

      "question": "Does the image feature bold outlines, vibrant colors, and exaggerated expressions typical of pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has characteristics that align with pop-art styles, including evident bold outlines around characters and elements, vibrant and contrasting colors throughout the panels, and characters with exaggerated, cartoonish facial expressions, particularly visible in the icing eyes and animated movements of the donut characters. These elements conform to the aesthetics typical of pop-art.",

      "question": "Are all donuts depicted with doughy limbs, expressive icing eyes, and sugar-crusted armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comic strip of Image B, the donut characters are creatively illustrated with anthropomorphic features: they have limbs made to appear dough-like, eyes crafted from icing to give expressive faces, and their exterior design indicates sugar-like armor, suggesting an imaginative depiction consistent with a cartoon style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text “Guardians of the Plate, unite!” spoken by a donut character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of the edited image (Image B), Panel 1 contains speech bubbles that are consistent with cartoon narratives. However, the text reads differently, using creative but jumbled words which are not straightforward English and resemble the phrase structure, but it does not actually contain the exact words 'Guardians of the Plate, unite!' Instead the text seems like a play on words using similar sounds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does Panel 2 show donuts surrounding a large coffee mug fortress, holding marshmallow spears and chocolate shields?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 2 depicts donut characters surrounding a large mug in a suggestive homage to something they could be protecting, resembling a fortress scenario. They are illustrated holding spear-like objects and shields that fit the comic's food-themed narrative. However, the explicit depiction of marshmallow spears and chocolate shields is not visually clear, but the playful representation of these objects serves as a metaphor for the mentioned items.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text elements (e.g., speech bubbles) rendered in playful, cartoon-style fonts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features text within speech bubbles that are artistically designed. They utilize playful and large cartoon-style fonts which are characteristic of comics and enhance the whimsical nature of the scenes depicted in the image. These fonts contribute a playful and engaging thematic presence typical in such illustrated narratives.",
