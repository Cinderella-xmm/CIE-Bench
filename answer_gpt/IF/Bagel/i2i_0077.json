      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror is centrally placed above the sink with the faucet directly beneath it, a typical layout for many bathrooms. Analyzing Image A, we see a similar arrangement where the mirror is also placed above the sink with the faucet underneath. This suggests that the fundamental layout involving the positioning of the mirror and faucet remains consistent in comparing both images.",

      "question": "Have the wall materials been changed to reflect classical Roman architectural aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the walls are composed of warm-toned stone tiles, resembling materials used in Roman architecture, which often featured stone and marble. In contrast, Image A shows dark, smooth walls and cabinetry without any stone tile appearance, reflecting modern design. This indicates a change towards classical Roman aesthetics in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes ornate wall sconces emitting a warm glow, which aligns with classical design and ambiance often found in Roman-style architecture. Comparatively, Image A employs simple pendant lights with a modern, sleek design. This suggests a shift in lighting to reflect classical Roman aesthetics in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of potted greenery and the placement of plants in a structured manner complements the classical Roman theme, where greenery and nature were integral to aesthetics. Image A has minimal, modern decor with no prominent greenery fitting classical Roman style. This points to a deliberate change in decor to match Roman aesthetics.",

      "question": "Does the overall scene now feature elements typical of a Roman-style bathhouse, such as columns, arches, or frescoes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features elements such as columns and arches, which are hallmark features of Roman architecture and bathhouses. By contrast, Image A lacks these structural elements, instead presenting a modern, minimalist interior. The introduction of columns and arches in Image B indicates a transformation to a scene reminiscent of Roman-style bathhouses.",
