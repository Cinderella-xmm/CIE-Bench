      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks, which are visibly orange, black, and silver. This is indicated by the texture and shape of the bricks, which match common LEGO pieces. The colors are distinct in the image, with the orange making up the majority of the body, black used for certain parts like the window and bed edges, and silver (or light gray) appearing on elements like the wheel hubs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the truck with wheels that are made from circular gray LEGO pieces, evident by their recognizable pattern and texture associated with LEGO wheel pieces. The original design, visible in Image A, features typical rubber tires with metal rims. The change in material and design is apparent from the smooth, uniform appearance of LEGO wheels in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed is constructed with LEGO bricks that form a smooth-looking surface, indicative of the typical LEGO assembly style using flat tiles. The original truck bed seen in Image A has a more textured surface typical of actual pickup truck designs meant to prevent slipping. The transition to a smooth LEGO tile surface in Image B is a notable change.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO truck displayed on what appears to be a plain white shelf. This is evident from the flat, uniform surface and the background with no elements that suggest ground contact, contrasting with Image A, where the truck is outdoors on gravel. The elevation is implied by the pedestal effect of a shelf setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the correct shape and proportions of the original pickup truck, including the cab, bed, and wheelbase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO truck model in Image B has the basic shape and proportions associated with pickup trucks, with clearly defined sections for the cab, bed, and wheelbase. However, due to the limitations of LEGO bricks, which are blocky and geometric, some aspects of the precise curvature and aerodynamic details are less accurate than the original truck in Image A. Therefore, while the overall structure is retained, the precision of shape and proportions relative to the original design might not be exact.",
