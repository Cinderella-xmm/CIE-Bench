      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a pocket watch situated inside a transparent glass dome, alongside a small library setting.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the books around the pocket watch are distinctly colorful with deep reds, browns, and hints of gold, reflecting earthy and vibrant color tones typical of leather-bound volumes from antiquity. However, there is no fabric visible around these elements in Image B, distinguishing it from Image A, where the fabric is present.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A showcases fabric with intricate golden embroidery patterns, Image B does not contain such fabric. Instead, the setting in Image B consists entirely of a miniature library and a domed display, lacking any textile embellishments such as embroidered patterns. This comparison highlights a shift from a textile-centric to a literary-themed visual in Image B.",
