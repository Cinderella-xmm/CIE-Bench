    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is only one zebra visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (second image), there appears to be only one zebra visible. The background is a plain green, which further supports the notion that there is only one zebra present in the image without any other surrounding objects or animals.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has all the grass been removed from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background consists solely of a green plane, indicating that any grass or natural elements have been removed, as the zebra stands against a simplified backdrop. This absence confirms that all grass has been removed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the grass area replaced by a green gradient plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image shows a consistent green color without any visible gradient. It appears uniform rather than transitioning gradually between shades. Thus, it is not a green gradient plane.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a calm and solitary atmosphere without extra distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image is a simple green plane, providing a focus on the single zebra without any additional elements or distractions, such as grass, other animals, or varied background details. This minimalism contributes to a calm and solitary atmosphere.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the original zebra's position and appearance preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the analysis of the zebra's position and orientation relative to the background, it maintains the same stance and characteristics as typically expected from a zebra. The absence of other elements does not affect its posture or visual identity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
