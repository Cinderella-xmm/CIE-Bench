      "question": "Has the black bottle cap been replaced with a transparent or translucent glass stopper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object on the top of the bottle is not a typical stopper but a dark-colored component consistent with common fragrance diffuser designs, where reeds protrude from the top, often without a visible stopper. A transparent or translucent glass stopper is usually distinct and visible, but in this image, the top component is a dark piece possibly used to hold the reeds in place, not a glass stopper.",
