      "question": "Is the woman depicted as a chibi-style character with an oversized head and simplified proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is indeed depicted as a chibi-style figure. This is evident through its exaggerated proportions, such as the large, oversized head and the small, simplified body, which are characteristic of chibi art style. Chibi characters are commonly designed to look cute and playful, which aligns with the visual impression given by the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image have a design consistent with a collectible fridge magnet, such as a border or background suggesting it is a small, flat object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not show any signs of being a small, flat object typical of fridge magnets. It lacks any specific border or background indication that would suggest it is designed to be a fridge magnet. Instead, the image appears to represent a three-dimensional figure rather than a flat, outlined image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown in Image B is indeed designed with oversized and vibrant frills, typical of a chibi design, but it lacks intricate detailing such as visible lace that one might find in more realistic or detailed art styles. The focus is on bold, simple shapes rather than intricate lacework.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible elements of jewelry in Image B show distinct gold accents, consistent with a chibi design which often uses bold, clear colors to highlight features. This includes the visible beads on the gown and any accessories in gold tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no depiction of furniture as the focus is solely on the character itself. The absence of furniture in the image indicates that the question of its style in this context is not applicable.",

      "explanation": "There is no decorative border surrounding the image itself in Image B. The focus is on the character and her gown, which has a border-like design made of pearls at the bottom, but this does not extend as an image border.",
