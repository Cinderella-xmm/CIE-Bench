      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird features exaggerated cartoonish, rounded shapes and smooth surfaces typical of a 3D chibi-style model. This is in contrast to the more detailed and realistic style seen in Image A, where the bird exhibits more textural detail and realistic anatomy. The transformation to a 3D chibi style is characterized by a simplified and stylized appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lemur in Image B has been altered to display the rounded, simplified features common in 3D chibi-style renderings. The original image features a more textured and detailed depiction, indicating a realistic style. The change reflects a shift to a more playful and stylized design, which is consistent with 3D chibi aesthetics.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters exhibit characteristics typical of 3D chibi style, including exaggerated smoothness, simplified details, and a more playful, stylized appearance compared to Image A's realistic portrayal.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images depict the characters in similar attire and accessories, with the outfits such as sleeveless tops and the pocket watch maintained. Despite the stylistic change to a 3D chibi aesthetic in Image B, the foundational elements of their clothing and accessories remain consistent with those in Image A, reflecting careful preservation of these attributes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images display the subjects in the same overall arrangement: a bird in flight above, a lemur in a tree, and characters positioned in a similar order around the microscope. This consistent layout indicates that despite the stylistic transformation into a 3D chibi style, the spatial composition and interaction between scene elements have been preserved.",
