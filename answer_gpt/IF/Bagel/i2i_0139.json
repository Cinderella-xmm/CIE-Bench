    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the carrot now growing inside a space greenhouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment surrounding the carrot appears to be enclosed by vertical, smooth surfaces and possibly transparent or reflective materials, suggesting an artificial setting rather than natural outdoor conditions. Such an environment could resemble a controlled setting like a space greenhouse where plants are grown in closed ecosystems.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include a metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber surrounding the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sides around the carrot in Image B have a smooth, shiny texture with a metallic-like appearance, indicative of a cultivation chamber environment. This type of environment is characterized by surfaces that are often metallic to hold and reflect light, maintaining specific climate conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carrot now rooted in synthetic substrate instead of natural soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the medium in which the carrot is rooted appears more uniform and pellet-like compared to natural soil, resembling synthetic substrate frequently used in controlled agriculture systems such as hydroponics or space cultivation, which often uses artificial growth mediums.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the carrot appear visibly rooted in the synthetic substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrot in Image B is depicted as inserted into this substrate medium, with the visible base and top of the carrot clearly rooted in the substrate, giving the impression that it is indeed growing directly within it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has all evidence of the original outdoor garden environment been removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Compared to Image A, which shows a natural outdoor environment with garden soil and foliage, Image B is enclosed by reflective surfaces with no visible backdrop of traditional outdoor elements like sky or surrounding plants. This indicates the original garden environment's evidence has been removed.",
