      "question": "Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the Hagia Sophia appears to be transformed into a creature-like figure. The center of the image showcases a large entity with a distinct body and head-like structure. This transformation includes elements such as the ornate cosmic patterns, indicative of a non-architectural, creature-like figure. The reasoning is based on the visual cues that suggest a departure from architectural integrity towards an animated, distinct figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of the typical architectural domes, there are appendages that extend outward resembling large, wing-like structures. These metallic appendages diverge from the static stone construction seen in traditional Hagia Sophia architecture, transforming the domes into more dynamic, wing-like forms.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four minarets of the Hagia Sophia are not replaced by leg-like structures. The minarets remain intact and bear their original form without transformation into limb-like features. The slender and vertical form of the minarets persists, indicating they have not been altered to resemble legs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structureâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the structure features glowing and intricate patterns that create a cosmic and abstract aesthetic, but they do not specifically resemble Byzantine art. The patterns may hint at otherworldly or fantastical elements rather than being authentic representations of Byzantine intricacies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome of the Hagia Sophia is replaced by a striking, jewel-like object that depicts cosmic imagery. This transformation alters the dome from a traditional architectural element into a visual display of nebulae and galaxies, suggesting an otherworldly motif.",
