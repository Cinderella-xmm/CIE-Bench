      "question": "Is the doll figure rendered in an oil painting style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image has undergone an editing process that appears to give it an artistic effect similar to that of an oil painting. The image's texture and blending style, discernible from the visible areas such as the doll figure and other elements, mimic characteristics typical of oil paintings, such as the alteration of solid colors into more blended strokes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image predominantly feature warm tones around the doll figure and wooden stump?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image exhibits a mix of colors that enhances some warm tones, but it is not predominant. The area around the doll figure and wooden stump includes various colors, but it doesn’t distinctly lean towards warmer tones predominantly.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible textures resembling a canvas on the doll and wooden stump?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not distinctly show a canvas texture. Instead, it features an artistic filter that alters the image’s sharpness and blending but does not add a canvas texture similar to physical painting surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the artistic editing, the positions and structures of the objects such as the doll figure and the wooden stump remain consistent with a likely intended preservation of object integrity. There are no apparent alterations or distortions in terms of their placement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The editing style includes visual modifications that result in edges appearing softer and more blended, resembling an oil painting effect where edges are less harsh and merge into the surroundings smoothly.",
