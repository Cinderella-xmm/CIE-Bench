      "question": "Does the edited image feature a halftone pattern with dots creating shades and gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a distinct pattern of small dots, typical of a halftone technique, used to create variations in shading and tone. This approach replicates the look of older comic books where dots are used to simulate different shades of a color. The background shows varying densities of dots which create a gradient-like effect. This indicates the use of a halftone pattern.",

      "question": "Are there vivid contrasts between the colors and elements in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are strong contrasts present, notably between the black and white of the soccer ball and goalpost, and the red and peach tones of the background. This stark difference in color and the bold black outlines of the objects against the colored background enhance the visual appeal and make each element stand out distinctly, creating a vivid contrast.",

      "question": "Do the soccer ball and goalpost in the edited image have sharp, well-defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a style typical of graphic or comic book art, with bold black outlines that create very sharp, well-defined edges around the soccer ball and goalpost. This stylistic choice is characteristic of pop art, contributing to a clear and easily recognizable form of each object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the soccer ball and goalpost been simplified into bold, graphic forms while remaining recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image uses strong black outlines and solid areas of black and white to represent the soccer ball and goalpost, simplifying them into bold, graphic forms. Despite this simplification, the essential features are retained, ensuring the items remain easily identifiable as a soccer ball and goalpost.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of the edited image is dynamic with its use of bold lines, vivid colors, and contrasting elements. The halftone background adds depth and interest, while the clear definition of the ball and goalpost draws the viewer's attention, resulting in a striking visual effect.",
