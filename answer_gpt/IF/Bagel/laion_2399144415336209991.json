      "question": "Is the couple depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated facial features and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually depicts characters in a cartoon style, characterized by exaggerated proportions such as larger heads and simplified features common in cartoon illustrations. This can be determined by observing the design style that aims to enhance expressiveness and distinct characteristics typical of cartoons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the beadwork on the bride’s gown been enhanced to appear more elaborate or exaggerated than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bride's gown with beadwork depicted in a cartoon style. Typically in cartoons, details such as beadwork might be simplified or stylized rather than exaggerated directly. Comparing Image A, where actual beadwork is detailed, Image B seems to maintain a similar level of detail but in a stylized form rather than enhancing or exaggerating it beyond its original elaboration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lapel appears larger in comparison to Image A, reflecting a cartoon style where proportions are often exaggerated for visual emphasis. Image A shows a regular-sized lapel typical for formal suits, whereas Image B adapts a similar visual communication style used in cartoons.",

      "question": "Are there three distinct scenes showing the couple holding hands, toasting, and dancing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are three panels depicted above the envelope with the couple in different poses, indicating scenes of varied actions such as toasting. However, since dancing and hand-holding are not distinctly illustrated or suggested, it can be deduced that only toasting is clearly present.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only the main couple image is enclosed with a heart-shaped border in gold trim, whereas the three smaller scenes on the envelope are framed with rectangular shapes, not individual heart-shaped borders.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that each scene above the envelope is placed on a cream background. The main surrounding design does include floral motifs, which are typical decorations meant to provide thematic coherence in illustrations such as wedding-themed cartoons.",
