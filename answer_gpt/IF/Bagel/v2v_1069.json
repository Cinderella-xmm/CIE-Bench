      "question": "Is the ceiling fan enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, there is a visible transparent dome enclosing a miniature scene consisting of a ceiling fan above a small house and trees. This setup distinctly resembles a snow globe, which traditionally features a glass enclosure. Given these observations, the answer is deduced to be that the fan is indeed within a snow globe.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the snow globe rest atop a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is placed on a surface that resembles a tabletop. The surrounding area has a uniformly warm tone with blurred elements that suggest simple, minimalistic design traits, commonly associated with soft lighting. This environment suggests a warm and uncluttered backdrop typically found in such settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, there is no visible evidence of intricate shimmering patterns cast on nearby surfaces, which could be attributed to light refracting through the globe. Such effects, typically seen when light interacts with rounded glass objects, are not apparent in the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fan inside the snow globe depicted in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan inside the snow globe maintains realistic proportions and finishes akin to those in Image A; there are no exaggerated or whimsical elements characteristic of a playful, cartoon-like style. This is confirmed by the realistic modeling and detailing of the fan and surrounding elements.",

      "question": "Are snowflakes visible drifting gently through the air inside the tiny room within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, there is a visible presence of snowflakes seemingly in motion, although they are not confined to a room but part of the entire snow globe scene surrounding a small house and a fan. These elements evoke the visual experience of snow globes where snowflakes usually float throughout the scene.",
