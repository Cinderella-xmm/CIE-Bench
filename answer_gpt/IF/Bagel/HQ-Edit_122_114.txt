    "Question": "Q1: Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stork features metallic plates that resemble segmented armor, which is a common design element in mechanical or steampunk aesthetics. The surface of the stork appears shiny and metallic, indicating the use of metal plates instead of natural feathers. This observation aligns with the concept of replacing organic elements with mechanical ones.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a structure surrounding the stork where gears and mechanical components are prevalent throughout. This suggests that the nest materials, typically made of twigs in a natural setting, have been wholly replaced by mechanical parts like cogs and gears, fitting the steampunk motif.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the roofline of the house features copper-colored pipes, which are a characteristic design element of the steampunk style. These pipes run alongside or integrate into the house's structure, providing a clear shift from a traditional roof to one that includes these industrial components.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stork is depicted with mechanical joints at various limb connections, which are particularly visible at the leg, neck, and wing areas. These joints symbolize the transition from organic to mechanical, a key feature of a steampunk style transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
    "explanation": "The scene in Image B is dominated by elements consistent with the steampunk style, including the use of mechanical components, gears, pipes, and metallic textures in both the stork and the house. The cohesive use of these elements across the entire image, replacing natural aspects with industrial designs, establishes a unified steampunk aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
