      "question": "Have the three sheep been converted into chibi characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts three figures with exaggeratedly cute features such as oversized heads, small bodies, and simple facial expressions, which are characteristic of chibi-style art. These figures resemble sheep but with human-like attributes, confirming their transformation into chibi characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chibi characters have scarves, earmuffs, and gloves added as winter accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, each chibi character is depicted wearing winter accessories: scarves around their necks, earmuffs on their heads, and gloves on their hands. This detail is clearly visible through the distinctive drawing style and coloration that represents these accessories.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the interaction pose of the chibi characters by the railing been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the original image, the sheep are standing close to a fence, appearing to interact with it. In the edited image, the chibi characters are positioned similarly near a vertical structure, suggesting that the pose of interaction with the barrier has been preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chibi characters depicted in a flat, cartoonish style with thick outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays chibi characters with attributes typical of a cartoonish style: simplified shapes, thick outlines, and minimal shading. These stylistic choices contribute to a flat appearance, which is consistent with many forms of chibi art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of the image transparent for sticker use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image is not transparent; instead, it appears as a pale or off-white color. A transparent background would show no color or detail, allowing the image to be overlaid directly onto any surface without a backdrop, which is not the case here.",
