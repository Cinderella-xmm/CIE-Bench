      "question": "Have the skiers been converted into 3D chibi-style characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skiers appear with exaggerated proportions and simplified features characteristic of chibi-style characters, including rounder shapes and a cartoon-like appearance. This analysis is based on recognizing common traits of chibi art, which often include oversized heads and a playful aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear of the skiers identical to those in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skiers are wearing red jackets similar to those in Image A, but the design is stylized to match the chibi aesthetic, such as rounded uniforms and cartoon-like skis. The backpacks also appear slightly altered to fit the chibi style, though they remain similar in form and color to the original. Therefore, while there are thematic similarities, the specifics are altered to match the chibi art style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the snowy forest setting been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes snow-covered trees, maintaining the original snowy forest theme from Image A. While the depiction is more stylized to fit a 3D chibi aesthetic, the presence of similar snow-laden trees suggests that the overall setting has been preserved.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the original arrangement of the environment, including the positions of the skiers and trees, preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positions of the skiers are side by side, resembling the side-by-side alignment in Image A. The trees also appear similarly arranged around a central open space where the skiers are located, suggesting that the general layout of the environment has been preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the skiers exhibit exaggerated proportions and simplified features typical of chibi art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skiers display exaggerated body proportions and highly simplified features, such as larger heads and a more compact body form, which are defining characteristics of chibi-style art. This conclusion is reached by comparing these features with the chibi art conventions that prioritize a cute, whimsical appearance.",
