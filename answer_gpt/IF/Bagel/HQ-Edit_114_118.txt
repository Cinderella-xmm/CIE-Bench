    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly enclosed within a visible curved glass dome. This is evident from the presence of the rounded, transparent boundary that encases the ship and the surrounding elements. The glass dome gives an impression of a miniature world inside a display case, which is common for such dioramas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",
    "explanation": "The sails in Image B show visible creases and layered edges with shadows that indicate they are made of a material like paper. The texture and structure of the sails, with their characteristic bends and shadows, mimic the appearance of papercraft, where individual paper pieces are layered and creased to create a detailed three-dimensional form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",
    "explanation": "Beneath the ship in Image B, there is a layer that appears to be made from a translucent, shimmering material, designed to mimic ocean waves. The appearance and texture of this layer suggest a resin-like material, commonly used in dioramas to simulate water owing to its reflective and refractive properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seagulls appear static yet dynamic as if they are in flight. The appearance of their suspension by fine wires suggests an intentional design to give the impression of them floating within the diorama. This method is typical in crafting intricate models where elements need to seem airborne.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "The ship in Image B retains structural elements such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now rendered in miniature scale. These features are meticulously crafted to capture the essence of the larger ship but in a scaled-down version suitable for placement within the small diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",
    "explanation": "The blue resin layer beneath the ship in Image B shows shimmering textures and light reflections. These features emulate the appearance of flowing water, a common technique in model making to simulate bodies of water by capturing the dynamic and reflective qualities of the ocean surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the curved glass dome visibly present with clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the curved glass dome is visibly present, with clear boundaries outlining its shape. Light refraction effects may occur due to the glass surface, which is typical in glass-covered displays, adding visual depth and realism to the scene inside.",
    "answer": "Yes"
