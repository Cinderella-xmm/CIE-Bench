      "question": "Is the map rendered as a partially unfurled scroll floating above a stylized ocean?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map appears as part of a scroll that is unfurled horizontally across the image and extends over an ocean-like blue section beneath it. The scroll has brown tones, typical of aged parchment, and the map element seems integrated into this scroll, enhancing the concept of floating over the stylized ocean. This visual cue, along with common depictions of nautical themes, supports the idea that the map is indeed rendered as a scroll.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a compass, there is a large ship's wheel depicted with rich golden tones and intricate engravings. This wheel is the central object in the image, emphasizing nautical exploration themes. The visual difference from the typical circular compass with cardinal markings is clear based on elements such as the handles typical to a ship's wheel.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains dark silhouettes of figures across the map area, resembling explorers due to their pose and the context.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing highlights can be observed, especially around lantern objects and the ship's wheel, implying illumination. These highlights are in a golden hue that contrasts with the darker areas, enhancing light simulation effects. However, the rest of the image retains brown tones consistent with classical map designs, preserving the original aesthetic while providing additional visual emphasis.",
