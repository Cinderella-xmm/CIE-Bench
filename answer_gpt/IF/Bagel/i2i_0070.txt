    "Question": "Q3: Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a prominent, bright band of stars and cosmic dust stretches across the sky, strongly resembling the Milky Way galaxy as it's typically depicted in night sky photography. This is a common representation of the Milky Way, supporting the conclusion that it is visible in the image.",

    "Question": "Q5: Do the train and railway tracks appear seamlessly integrated into the savanna background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train and railway tracks appear to be placed atop the savanna landscape, but they do not integrate seamlessly. The tracks abruptly stop in the savanna, and the train's alignment and lighting do not fully match the rest of the scene. The transition between the train tracks and the savanna does not appear natural or cohesive.",
    "answer": "No"
