      "question": "Has the body of the guitar been transformed into a dragon's torso with organic, beast-like features such as scales or musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a dragon featuring organic scales and defined musculature, typical of mythical beast representations, rather than the wooden body of a guitar seen in Image A. The visual transformation is evident through the replacement of a guitar's smooth surface with a textured, organic form resembling a living creature's torso, demonstrating beast-like features.",

      "question": "Has the guitar neck been reshaped into an elongated, elegant dragon neck that extends naturally from the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a distinct, elongated neck characteristic of a dragon, which extends naturally from its torso. This is compared to Image A, where the neck appears as a straightforward extension of the guitar body. The transformation involves organic curves and textures typically associated with a dragon's neck.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the original tuning pegs been replaced with golden, horn-like spikes on the headstock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dragon with horn-like features, but they appear as part of the dragon's anatomical structure rather than as tuning pegs on a guitar. In Image A, the tuning pegs are clearly visible as standard metallic knobs on the guitar. Thus, the transformation visible does not specifically replace tuning pegs with horn-like spikes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible luminescent runes embedded or drawn along the fretboard of the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features glowing runes down the dragonâ€™s body, creating an effect similar to luminescent markings. In comparison, Image A's guitar fretboard does not feature any such glowing symbols or runes. The transformation highlights luminescence on an area corresponding to a fretboard in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the guitar strings been replaced with fiery, flame-like tendrils that extend from the bridge to the nut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not portray any guitar strings as flame-like tendrils. Instead, it visualizes a dragon with intricate details. In contrast, Image A features actual strings on the guitar. The image description for Image B shows typical dragon anatomy rather than transforming guitar strings into any tendril-like form.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Have the cutaway horns of the guitar been transformed into majestic wings featuring intricate, scale-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays large, majestic wings with scale-like patterns, a design choice that reflects dragon imagery. In contrast, Image A features the cutaway horns of a guitar, which are solid and lack such patterns or thematic elements. This illustrates the transformation from structured guitar cutaways to organically intricate wings.",
