      "question": "Is the rose bush rendered as a mosaic mural composed of distinct tile-like segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose bush appears as a mosaic mural with each part segmented into distinct, small units that resemble tiles. This is evident from the visible borders separating each segment, typical of mosaic art, which contrasts the natural and continuous form a plant takes in reality. This method uses small, individual pieces to create an overall image, characteristic of mosaic techniques.",

      "question": "Are all flowers outlined with bold, distinct borders resembling ceramic tile edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that each flower is outlined with bold borders that emphasize their separation from each other, suggesting the characteristics of ceramic tiles. These borders are uniform and well-defined, similar to grout lines found between tiles in ceramic artworks. In contrast, in Image A, flowers naturally blend into the background without such strong delineations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petals and leaves depicted in shades of pearl (soft white/off-white) and jade (greenish tones), replacing their original colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the petals and leaves in stylized colors, notably pearl for petal tones and jade for leaf tones, rendering a deliberate artistic interpretation rather than the natural colors observed in Image A, where petals show subtle variations in white and pink, and leaves display deep green hues typical of natural vegetation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the red brick building been abstracted using terracotta tile shades (warm earthy tones) instead of realistic red bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's depiction uses warm earthy tones akin to terracotta tiles, making the structure appear as part of the stylized mosaic scene rather than realistic brickwork shown in Image A. This abstraction gives a less literal representation, focusing instead on artistic expression through color palette manipulation to convey an impression of brick without using typical red hues.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are architectural features of the building (such as arches or window frames) incorporated into the mosaic pattern as stylized elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The architectural features in Image B, such as window frames and other structural elements, are incorporated seamlessly into the broader mosaic mural as stylized elements, contributing to the overall artistic format. This contrasts with Image A, which maintains a realistic portrayal of architectural details. The integration into the mural suggests an artistic approach where real-world elements are adapted into the stylized aesthetic of the mosaic.",
