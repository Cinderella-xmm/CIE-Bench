        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that initially appears as an ornate book in Image A is now depicted as interlocking wooden puzzle pieces. This is evident from the puzzle piece outlines, which segment the formerly solid design into modular, connectable parts. The transformation from a singular form to a divided, puzzle-like structure confirms the objectâ€™s new depiction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon patterns are visibly in darker wood tones, highlighted against the lighter background of the puzzle pieces. This contrast is deliberate to ensure the dragon designs are prominent and visually distinct from the rest of the puzzle, thus clearly indicating a difference in wood tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the compass area is in a lighter wood tone, featuring a clean and less intricate design compared to the darker, more detailed dragon patterns. This suggests the use of lighter wood tones specifically for the compass area, making it contrast with the darker dragon elements.",
