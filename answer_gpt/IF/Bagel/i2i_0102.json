    {

      "question": "Is the word “Draft” written in a handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' appears cursive and uneven, characteristics commonly associated with handwritten or script fonts. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge of handwriting styles, allows us to conclude that it resembles a handwritten font.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word “Draft” placed on the yellow paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is located on the surface of the yellow paper. The visual cues suggest the paper serves as a backdrop for the text, consistent with common uses of paper for writing. Based on the visual placement and understanding of typical paper usage, the word appears to be directly on the yellow paper.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image resemble a design sketch cover focused on presenting the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the word 'Draft' prominently on a yellow piece of paper, in an environment that includes a pencil and a laptop. Given these elements, the composition might suggest it's a cover page or introductory element for a design sketch. However, without explicit indicators like a drawing or sketch elements more pronounced, the focus appears more on the word itself from a casual observation.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is clearly written on the yellow paper, both in terms of visibility and legibility, allowing immediate recognition. The high contrast between the dark text and bright background further supports its clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any elements in the image other than the yellow paper and the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B includes additional elements such as a blue pencil and a part of a laptop, indicating elements beyond just the yellow paper and the word 'Draft'. These elements contribute to the context of the image, offering insight into a possible scene involving writing or working at a desk.",
