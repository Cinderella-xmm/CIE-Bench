      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's body exhibits layered and reflective surfaces consistent with crystal, specifically resembling the rich, green color of emerald or jade. This appearance is characterized by a glossy, transparent texture and structured layers, indicating a crystal-like composition. In contrast, Image A shows a standard, painted military truck exterior without such reflective and faceted properties.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the truck's wheels as transparent, with a crystalline appearance that suggests a material similar to quartz. The wheels show a structured, geometric pattern within, typical of crystalline substances. This contrasts with Image A, where the wheels are typical rubber tires used in military vehicles, lacking transparency or crystalline patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck placed on a smooth, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck rests on what appears to be a smooth, white base with veining that is characteristic of marble, enhancing the aesthetic of the crystalline truck. This differs from Image A, where the truck is on a natural, rough terrain typical of outdoors or a military testing ground.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of the truck in Image B are composed of angular and faceted planes that resemble crystal geometry, which would naturally reflect and refract light, adding to the gem-like allure. Image A has the typical smooth, metallic panels of a military vehicle, with no such angular, faceted surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the basic form, proportions, and layout of Image A's military truck. Despite being transformed into a crystal model, the shape, including the cabin, body, and wheel arrangement, mirrors the original truck, indicating the transformation preserved its structural design.",
