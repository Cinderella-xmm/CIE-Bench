      "question": "Has the sparrow been transformed into an ethereal blossom spirit with a non-realistic, floral appearance?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has undergone a significant transformation from its realistic form in Image A.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers of the bird are no longer present in their natural form as seen in Image A.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows patterns that simulate the appearance of blossoms integrated into the design along the bird's wings. These intricate patterns give the appearance of florals, which were not present in the original, natural depiction of the sparrow in Image A.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's eyes are depicted with an unnatural, bright emerald-green glow, differentiating significantly from the realistic dark eyes of the sparrow in Image A. This glowing effect enhances the ethereal and otherworldly aura of the transformed bird.",
