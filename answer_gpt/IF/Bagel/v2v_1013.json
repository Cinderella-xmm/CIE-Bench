      "question": "Have the two birds been transformed into realistic anime-style model figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds appear as smooth, stylized, and colorful models that resemble anime or cartoon-like figures, rather than realistic representations. Their features, such as the smooth surfaces and large eyes, suggest that these are anime-style model figures. This transformation aligns with common depictions of characters or objects in an anime style, showcasing simplified and exaggerated features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the anime-style bird models placed on a desktop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the models standing on a flat, wooden surface that resembles a tabletop. The context and appearance suggest this is likely a desktop or similar flat surface typical for displaying small figures or models.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the image captured from a casual snapshot perspective, similar to a mobile phone photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to be carefully composed, with a focus on lighting, angle, and composition which suggests intentional artistry rather than a casual snapshot. The image is likely rendered or digitally manipulated, as is common in promotional or artistic visualizations of models, rather than captured spontaneously with a mobile phone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the anime-style models faithfully represent the birds' full body postures, feather textures, and coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B captures the general postures and color schemes of the birds, the anime-style abstraction means it does not faithfully represent the intricate feather textures and detailed coloration found in real birds. Instead, it offers a simplified, stylized version focusing on basic shapes and colors.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth, polished look with clean lines and gradient color transitions. While it lacks intricate textural detail, the rendering is refined within the constraints of anime-style, focusing on smooth color transitions and overall design clarity rather than minute detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does indeed have an anime-inspired look with its stylized forms and vibrant colors, though it focuses on simplicity rather than rich textures. The emphasis is on form and color harmony typical of anime art, with an exquisite and polished overall look.",
