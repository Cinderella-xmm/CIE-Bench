        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small orb or capsule near the creature's feet styled with colors and patterns that reflect elements like gridlines, beige paper, or metallic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small orb near the creatureâ€™s feet. The orb is styled with colors and patterns, but they do not specifically reflect gridlines or metallic textures.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a text displayed beneath the creature that likely represents a creative name or perhaps a stylized text associated with the creature. The text is written in a stylized font, suggesting it might be a name or title for the character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not explicitly include an elemental type like 'Craft,' 'Metal,' 'Precision,' or 'Pattern.' The image focuses on the chibi creature without additional text indicating an elemental classification. The presence of tools like scissors or rulers is not visually represented in a way that suggests an elemental type.",
