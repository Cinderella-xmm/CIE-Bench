    "Question": "Q1: Does the dancing woman appear as if made of stained glass with distinct panel-like divisions and dark outlines resembling lead came?",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's clothing and adornments appear with distinct panel-like divisions typical of stained glass, but lack the flowing, curvilinear lines and intricate geometric patterns associated with the Art Nouveau movement, which often features more organic and fluid designs.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the trees and huts in the background redesigned with smooth, curving lines and organic shapes typical of Art Nouveau, rather than naturalistic forms?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is illustrated with distinct, bold outlines and has a segmented appearance as opposed to the smooth, curving, and natural shapes typical of Art Nouveau. This gives the background more of a stained glass look rather than flowing, organic shapes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall color scheme of the image muted and iridescent, resembling colored glass with soft transitions and low contrast, rather than vibrant, saturated colors?",
    "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B appears softer and more subdued, characteristic of stained glass art where colors are more muted and transitions can be softer due to the nature of the material. This contrasts with the vibrant and saturated colors commonly seen in other styles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the entire image exhibit a sense of continuous, flowing ornamentation and balanced movement, with decorative details linking the dancer and environment in a unified design?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a segmented structure typical of stained glass, which breaks the continuous flow observed in styles like Art Nouveau. While there is a thematic consistency, the segmented motif does not provide the flowing ornamentation or movement found in fully integrated design styles.",
    "answer": "No"
