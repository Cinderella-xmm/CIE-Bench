      "question": "Has the reflection in the mirror been replaced with a nighttime city skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the mirror clearly shows a nighttime city skyline, characterized by multiple illuminated buildings and a dark sky. The presence of skyscrapers and lights, indicative of nighttime, is easily observable in the reflection. Comparing with the original Image A, which simply shows a plain reflection, it is evident that the reflection has been changed to depict a city skyline.",

      "question": "Does the new reflection in the mirror enhance visual depth compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the introduction of a city skyline with illuminated skyscrapers adds layers of detail and perspective, which contribute to a greater sense of visual depth compared to Image A's plain reflection. The varied architectural structures and lighting effects in Image B's mirror reflection create a multidimensional view, enriching the visual experience.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the mirror's position and frame identical to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the position and framing of the mirror remain constant as in Image A. Both images exhibit a large rectangular mirror with a minimalist frame positioned centrally above the sink. This consistency in position and design indicates that the mirror itself has not been altered, only its reflection has changed.",

    {

      "question": "Does the new reflection include elements indicative of a nighttime setting, such as a dark sky and lit buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in Image B distinctly features elements typical of a nighttime setting, with a dark sky as backdrop and numerous buildings illuminated with lights. These features are clear indicators of the nighttime environment, contrasting starkly with the simple reflection observed in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the sink, marble countertop, and accessories such as the towel, soap bottle, and decorative plant remain unchanged. All elements apart from the mirror reflection maintain their positions and appearances, confirming that no alterations were made to these components between the two images.",
