      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers in the headdress are noticeably more exaggerated, with smoother, rounded petals, indicating a shift towards a chibi-style design where elements are usually more cartoonish and simplified.
