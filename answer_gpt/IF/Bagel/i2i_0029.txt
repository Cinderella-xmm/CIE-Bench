    "Question": "Q1: Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the grass has been replaced with a black-and-white striped pattern that matches the zebra's stripes. These stripes appear to expand outward from the zebra's body and continue uninterrupted into the background. This suggests an intentional blending of the zebra's stripes with what was previously the grass. Thus, based on the visual cues, the zebra's stripes do extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the background pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the grassland rendered in a black-and-white striped pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, what was previously grass in Image A is covered by a pattern of black-and-white stripes that are very similar to those found on a zebra. The entire background area where grass would typically be has been modified into this striped pattern. This indicates that the grassland is rendered as a black-and-white striped pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?",
    "explanation": "The image in Image B features a transition of zebra stripes that seamlessly extend into the background, forming a unified visual of stripes. This creative manipulation results in a scene that merges the animal with its surrounding, departing from realistic representation. Such a portrayal aligns with the characteristics of surrealism, which often blends unusual elements together to create dream-like or unreal scenarios.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there any abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the grass?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no obvious abrupt changes or breaks at the boundary between the zebra's body and the background pattern. The stripes of the zebra continue fluidly into the striped background without any discernible discontinuity. The lack of breaks or transitions suggests a seamless, continuous design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the zebra's original body proportion been maintained despite the extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra itself appears unchanged in shape or size compared to typical images or known proportions of zebras. The integration or extension of its stripes into the background does not alter its body structure or proportion. Each component of the zebra's body, such as the legs and torso, retains typical proportions, which suggests that the body proportion has been maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
