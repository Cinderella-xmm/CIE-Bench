      "question": "Is the food processor now enclosed within a box-like packaging structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a box visible with printed images of the food processor and additional graphics. The presence of multiple surfaces and clear edges indicates a three-dimensional packaging box structure. This information, combined with common knowledge about how consumer electronics are typically packaged, suggests that the food processor is within a box-like packaging.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the visible colors on the box are primarily black and silver. The silver is reflective, which suggests a metallic finish, while the black appears non-reflective, consistent with a matte finish. This balance of finishes is common for product packaging to convey a premium quality.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Waring' is displayed prominently on the box in Image B.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perspective of the food processor image on the packaging shows multiple sides slightly offset, typical of an isometric view, which is often used in technical and product illustrations to give a three-dimensional representation without distortion.",

      "explanation": "Examining Image B, there are no exploded views showing disassembled components. Instead, separate images of components are depicted, but they are not presented in a way that illustrates an exploded or disassembled view. An exploded view typically shows how different parts fit within each other, which is not observed here.",
