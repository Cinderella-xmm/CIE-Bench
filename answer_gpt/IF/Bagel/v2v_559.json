      "question": "Have both individuals been transformed into a chibi-style 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals are depicted with exaggerated, cartoonish proportions, characteristic of chibi style. This involves a larger head relative to the body and simplified, rounded features, which are indicative of 3D chibi models. The visual cues clearly show these proportions, confirming the transformation into a chibi-style 3D model.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person in front still wearing a formal suit and holding a cup in the chibi-style 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front individual maintains a formal suit attire, as evidenced by the consistent shape and structure of the clothing, which resembles a suit jacket and tie. The person is also holding a cup, similar to the gesture seen in realistic images, indicating that these elements have been retained even in the chibi transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the person in the back positioned near a gently glowing lamp resting on a table in the chibi-style 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a lamp on a table. The lamp appears to emit a gentle glow, casting a warm light similar to that in Image A, indicating that the position and elements of the scene have been preserved in the chibi-style representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the scene maintain a photorealistic vibe with warm lighting throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall scene is transformed into a chibi-style model, which lacks the photorealistic texture typical of real-life imagery. Although some elements, like the warm lighting, are represented, the simplified and stylized nature of chibi models precludes the retention of a photorealistic vibe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire composition enclosed within a photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of Image B show a distinct frame surrounding the scene with a visible border, indicating that the composition is enclosed within what appears to be a photo frame. This frame is easily identified due to its lighter color and defined edges, typical of picture frames.",
