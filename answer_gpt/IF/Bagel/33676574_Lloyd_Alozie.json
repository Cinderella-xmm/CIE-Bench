      "question": "Do the skyscrapers appear as integrated, articulated robotic limbs forming a larger guardian-like figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues present a large, robot-like structure prominently located in the cityscape. This figure has distinct mechanical features such as articulated limbs and is constructed in a manner consistent with a humanoid guardian structure, suggesting that the buildings themselves are not simply skyscrapers but are part of this mechanical figure. This is derived from the overall appearance and placement of these elements, where the buildings act more like components of a large robot rather than traditional skyscrapers.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible neon circuitry patterns running along the facades of the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of neon blue lines and geometric patterns on the surface of the structures, including the large mechanical figure and adjoining towers, resembles circuitry. These patterns are spread across the infrastructure and are visually distinct as they emit a bright, glowing color akin to neon lights, typical of science fiction interpretations of futuristic cities or technology.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the building facades feature reflective, scale-like panels arranged in an overlapping or segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image prominently displays large, smooth surfaces with neon circuitry, but there are no clear signs of textured, scale-like panels or segmentation that would resemble such a pattern. The surfaces are characterized by sleek, futuristic designs rather than overlapping scales.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the expressways depicted as glowing, curving, spine-like structures emitting light and winding through the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases expressways that arc through the scene with a luminescent blue glow. Their curved nature and emitted light create an impression of fluidity and movement, resembling a spine-like structure as they wind through the cityscape. This evokes a futuristic, almost organic design intertwined with urban elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of the buildings feature enhanced, fin-like vertical structures that resemble mechanical protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, many of the buildings and structures, particularly those forming the backdrop and parts of the robot, have vertical elements extending upwards. These structures resemble mechanical fins, enhancing the futuristic and mechanical aesthetic of the cityscape, providing a stylized, mechanical or aerodynamic aspect to the buildings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there rotating holographic elements positioned across the skyline that resemble pulsing, eye-like forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes large circular shapes that emit a blue glow, particularly on the large mechanical figure and infrastructures behind. These are suggestive of eye-like forms due to their position and glowing nature. They appear as key visual elements within the skyline, reinforcing a theme of advanced technology or surveillance, akin to holographic eyes.",
