      "question": "Has the original pyramid been converted into five adorable chibi-style Russian nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four Russian nesting dolls designed in a chibi style featuring faces with large eyes, rosy cheeks, and friendly expressions. The dolls are visually distinct from a pyramid structure seen in Image A, indicating a transformation took place. The distinction in the number of elements (four dolls versus a singular pyramid) supports the conclusion that a conversion to multiple, not five, dolls occurred.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls feature pyramid-inspired designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls have painted designs that mimic a pyramid-like shape. Each doll has a pointed top that resembles the apex of a pyramid, and their outfits have triangular and diamond patterns reminiscent of pyramid stones. This indicates a design inspired by pyramids.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are indeed arranged from the largest to the smallest, from left to right, which exhibits a descending order in terms of their size.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are shown standing on a surface that appears to be a wooden table. The table gives an impression of warmth and sophistication due to its polished and clean appearance, indicative of a well-crafted piece of furniture.",

      "question": "Does the edited image have a horizontal 3:2 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to have a more square-like orientation rather than the elongated appearance characteristic of a 3:2 ratio. A 3:2 aspect ratio is commonly more rectangular, typically found in traditional photographic dimensions. The balance and proportion in Image B do not match this ratio, suggesting it is closer to a 1:1 aspect ratio.",
