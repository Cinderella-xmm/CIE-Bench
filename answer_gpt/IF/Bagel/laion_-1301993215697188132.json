      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl character's wings appear to be lifted in a gesture reminiscent of expressive hand movements. The positioning suggests a communicative action similar to hand gestures, thereby retaining the intended expressive quality of the original image.",

      "explanation": "Image B contains several speech bubbles around the owl character, but the text within them is largely nonsensical or misspelled. While they are related to the theme of speaking ('SSTSE AOTY', 'TREMFMENON'), they do not directly convey meaningful articulation and clarity.",
