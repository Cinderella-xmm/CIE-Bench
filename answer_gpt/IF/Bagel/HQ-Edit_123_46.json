      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the basketball player depicted in a mid-dribble pose with the ball near the ground and body in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player is shown holding the ball with one hand while in a dynamic stance, leading with their left leg as if moving forward. However, the ball is positioned at waist height rather than near the ground, suggesting more of a preparatory dribble or control position than a mid-dribble pose. World knowledge about basketball indicates a mid-dribble pose typically involves the ball being closer to the ground and the knees being bent deeply in motion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a comic or retro-cartoon style, characterized by thick, bold black outlines surrounding the player, the basketball, the hoop, and other elements within the court area. World knowledge about comic-style illustrations supports this observation, as such styles are known for their use of defined lines to delineate boundaries and emphasize shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic action lines around the player’s legs, arms, or the basketball to emphasize motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration uses lines commonly seen in comics to convey movement and energy. These lines are visible around the player's arms and legs, which highlight the action and motion of basketball play, consistent with cartoon techniques to depict motion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image vibrant shades of red and orange, particularly in the player’s uniform and surrounding lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily uses vibrant reds and oranges, especially noticeable in the player's uniform. The background shows a warm color palette that enhances the color contrast, typical in many illustrations or artworks to give a vibrant and lively impression, often used to suggest energy and excitement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains text in a stylized font, appearing in a voice bubble reminiscent of comic prints. While the exact text doesn’t suggest a recognizable fictional game title like 'Hoops Fever '87', it does employ a retro-styled typeface typical of comic narratives.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct border that frames the entire illustration, akin to a comic panel. This frame is consistent with the typical presentation of comic pages, where panels are outlined to separate individual scenes and narratives.",
