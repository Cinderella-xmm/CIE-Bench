    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire heart-shaped board composed solely of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, it is clear that the heart-shaped board is constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, forming a mosaic-like structure. The distinctive studded surfaces characteristic of LEGO pieces are visible throughout, indicating a purely LEGO composition without any non-LEGO elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the LEGO bricks used to represent the food items colored appropriately to match the original produce (e.g., blue for blueberries, red for tomatoes)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the LEGO bricks do broadly correspond to the expected colors of the food items they are meant to represent. For example, blue bricks can be seen representing blueberries, red bricks for tomatoes, and green bricks for broccoli, which demonstrates an effort to mimic real-life produce using similar colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are different LEGO brick sizes and shapes used to simulate textures (e.g., smooth bricks for avocado, small round bricks for berries, larger chunky bricks for broccoli)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a variety of LEGO brick sizes and shapes are employed, which contribute to different textures—a fundamental aspect of representing varied objects using LEGO. For instance, assorted bricks sizes and shapes capture the nuances of texture, akin to smooth bricks for avocados and chunkier ones for broccoli. This shows a thoughtful application of different LEGO pieces to imply texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do all food items in the LEGO mosaic have clearly defined and distinct borders separating them from adjacent items?",
    "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, it's apparent that borders between different food representations aren't sharply distinct, as the LEGO pieces create a somewhat blended transition. This indicates a more integrated mosaic rather than one with precise separation between each item.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the overall shape of the LEGO mosaic remain a perfect heart, matching the original board’s silhouette?",
    "explanation": "The heart shape formed by the LEGO mosaic in Image B mirrors the heart silhouette seen in Image A. The boundaries formed by the red LEGO bricks closely mimic the heart-shaped curve, maintaining the overall shape integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the LEGO mosaic placed on a solid, neutral gray base with no visible texture or pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO mosaic is placed against a solid gray background lacking visible texture or intricate pattern. This neutral, consistent backdrop complements the vibrant LEGO construction without adding any distractions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the LEGO mosaic exhibit a clear pixelated, blocky appearance consistent with a LEGO construction, rather than a smooth or realistic rendering?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO mosaic in Image B undeniably presents a pixelated, blocky aesthetic, a classic characteristic of LEGO constructions. Each respective LEGO piece contributes to a fragmented, non-realistic look, which reinforces the blocky nature rather than offering a smooth or lifelike depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
