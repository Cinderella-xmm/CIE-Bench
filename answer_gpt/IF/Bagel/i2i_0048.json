      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the contrast between the white and black stripes of the zebras and between the foliage and ground appears more pronounced compared to what would be naturally expected, indicating an enhancement in contrast. This conclusion is drawn by observing how stark the whites and blacks appear, as well as the emphasized distinctions in color tones throughout the image.",

      "question": "Is there visible improvement in the sharpness of zebras and the grassy ground in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image utilizes high contrast but does not necessarily display improved sharpness. Instead, the alterations create an artistic effect where edges are more pronounced due to contrast rather than clarity or detail enhancement. Thus, while the image appears sharper at a glance, this is not due to actual improvement in sharpness but due to contrast adjustments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the natural textures of the zebras' stripes and the grassland detailed and clear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, natural textures are obscured by the stylistic emphasis of contrast. While the stripes of the zebras remain pronounced, any fine details, such as individual hairs or the texture of the grass, seem lost in the exaggerated coloration effect. This suggests that natural textures are not clear and are overshadowed by artificial enhancements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing the edited image, no urban elements such as buildings, vehicles, or people have been introduced. The visual focus remains on the zebras and the natural grass landscape, unchanged in terms of subject matter, although stylistically altered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in terms of subject placement and the scene setting—zebras in grassland—has been preserved in the edited image. The focus remains on the natural scene as in the original context, without rearrangement or repositioning of elements, although the visual style has been altered.",
