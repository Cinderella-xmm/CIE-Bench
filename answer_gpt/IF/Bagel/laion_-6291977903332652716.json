      "question": "Is the entire canal scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature village that is encased within what appears to be a transparent spherical structure, which is a common characteristic of snow globes or glass-encased models. This conclusion is drawn from the visible curvature and reflected light patterns on the boundary surrounding the scene, indicating it is within a spherical enclosure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the timber-framed houses rendered with enhanced texture detail and colored in muted autumnal tones (e.g., browns, oranges, soft reds)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The timber-framed houses in Image B appear to be miniatures with detailed texturing. They display colors in muted autumnal tones like browns, oranges, and soft reds, which align with typical autumn palette. This contrasts with Image A, which shows natural, vibrant colors of an actual scene. The choice of tones in Image B gives it a more artistic and crafted look.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the canal water appear glossy and reflective, resembling a polished resin surface rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water depicted in the canal has a glossy, highly reflective appearance, characteristic of polished resin surfaces used in miniature models to imitate water. This differs from Image A, where the water in the canal looks like natural water with reflections that are not as pronounced or uniform.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there scaled-down, detailed mini bridges and additional greenery (such as small plants or moss) integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there are indeed small models of bridges and additional greenery such as small plants or bushes integrated into the scene, which are crafted to scale with the miniature houses. These elements enhance the realistic depiction of a village scene within a modeled environment, unlike the actual human-scale scene in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features small, stylized figures dressed in vibrant clothing, adding life to the miniature model scene. These figures have the appearance of hand-sculpted models, typical in crafted miniatures, differing from Image A where the figures are real people in a natural setting.",
