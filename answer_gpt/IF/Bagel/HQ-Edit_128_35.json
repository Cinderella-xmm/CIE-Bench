      "question": "Is the typewriter now depicted as part of a notebook cover, with the overall shape resembling a closed book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements indicate a flat, rectangular object resembling a book cover laid on a marbled surface. There is no depiction of a typewriter itself in this image. Instead, the focus is on the textual and iconographic design typical of a book cover. This suggests that the object now represents a closed book rather than incorporating a typewriter.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
