      "question": "Is the entire urban street scene recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene exhibits characteristics commonly associated with Lego recreations. The plastic-like texture, vibrant colors, and simplified geometric shapes align with how Lego sets typically represent environments. The background buildings and cobbled street are constructed in a manner consistent with Lego bricks, showcasing interlocking pieces suggestive of Lego's design style. Therefore, world knowledge of Lego's design prompts the conclusion that the entire street scene is recreated using Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Are the cobblestones on the path represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct, uniform, rectangular shapes forming the cobblestones on the street. This suggests a stylized representation where the repetitive, modular design fits the characteristics of Lego bricks. Cobblestones in real life have more tactile variation, while Lego bricks offer a consistent texture and orderly alignment. This visual consistency indicates that the cobblestones are indeed represented using Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Are the buildings in the background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings exhibit a blocky, modular structure typical of Lego architecture. The clean edges, simplified detailing, and bright colors are consistent with Lego bricks, often used to create miniature architectural models. World knowledge of Lego sets and their use in building structures leads to the reasoning that the background buildings are indeed recreated using Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Is the man and his clothing, bag, and cap represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figure composed of distinct, solid color pieces and simplified features common to Lego minifigures. The man's clothing is blocky, and the superficial detailing conforms to Lego minifigure design styles. Familiarity with Lego sets and their specific minifigure characteristics supports the judgement that the man, along with his clothing, bag, and cap, are represented using Lego bricks.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and perspective of the urban street scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the general setup and layout are preserved, maintaining a similar perspective and arrangement in both. The direction of the cobblestone path, the positioning of buildings, and the central figure holding a bag, shown from behind, are consistently depicted. Despite the change in representation to Lego bricks, the composition and perspective remain faithful to the original urban street sceneâ€™s layout.",
