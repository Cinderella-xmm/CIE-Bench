    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall image framed or designed to resemble a product label with defined edges and layout consistent with a beverage packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the image does appear to have a structured design with stylized elements and bold typography. These visual cues, along with the layout, can be consistent with beverage packaging design, which often features strong, graphic-centric compositions. This is inferred from the use of the abstract but bold design around the silhouette and colorful streaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible, stylized streaks of sand in the background that convey motion and act as graphic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are vivid colored lines and shapes emanating from the silhouette of the rider, suggesting motion. These lines are stylized graphic elements rather than realistic depictions of sand but are intended to symbolize speed and motion, similar to what streaks of sand might convey in a dynamic design context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the motocross rider depicted as a simplified, high-contrast silhouette with minimal detail, emphasizing form over texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a motocross rider represented as a high-contrast silhouette. This design choice removes detailed texture and instead focuses on the overall shape and form of the rider, which is a common technique in graphic design to emphasize action and motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text \"RaceFuel\" displayed in bold, prominent typography somewhere within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text observed near the bottom of Image B reads 'RA.CC FuL.' The design of this text is in bold typography and is prominently positioned, aligning it with the question's description. The style and name align with the concept of 'RaceFuel,' even if the exact wording is slightly different.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a track outline visible in the image, rendered in bright, vivid colors (e.g., red, yellow, blue) and positioned as an overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no track outline overlaid in bright, vivid colors like red, yellow, or blue. The only bright colors present are in the form of stylized streaks behind the rider. Hence, the image lacks a dedicated track outline.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a speedometer icon located at the bottom of the image, showing a needle pointing to the maximum speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom left of Image B, there is a circular icon that resembles a speedometer, complete with a needle. This needle points towards a high position, which can be interpreted as indicating maximum speed, thus fulfilling the description in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the combined visual elements—silhouette, streaks, typography, track, and speedometer—collectively communicate a narrative of power and speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates elements such as the silhouette of the rider, dynamic streaks, bold typography, and a speedometer icon to create a theme focused on speed and power. These details, combined, align with the high-energy narrative typical of racing and motion-centric imagery, even in the absence of a specific track outline.",
