      "question": "Does the elephant’s skin feature a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's skin displays a prominent galaxy-inspired theme with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls. This visually represents a starry sky or universe wrapped around the elephant, intertwining celestial elements with its skin texture. This analysis relies on the distinct cosmic patterns that are observed on the elephant’s body.",

      "question": "Do the elephant’s tusks exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance with glowing, cloud-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's tusks have a shimmering appearance with a cloud-like texture, resembling nebulae. The visual cues like glowing accents and ethereal quality contribute to this assessment. This is through observing the bright and smooth textures of the tusks in comparison to how nebulae can appear.",

      "question": "Are the elephant’s ears replaced with vast, sail-like structures that reflect starry constellations and have a celestial appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ears of the elephant in Image B are transformed into sail-like structures that indeed reflect starry constellations and possess a celestial appearance. Observing the surface pattern, they showcase cosmic elements that are commonly associated with outer space visuals, which supports the conclusion of a celestial transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the elephant’s trunk emit a visible, swirling cosmic mist composed of glowing particles or nebula-like vapor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s trunk is depicted as emitting a visible, swirling cosmic mist. This mist consists of glowing particles and nebula-like vapor, as evidenced by the swirling effect and luminescent qualities visible in the image, drawing from characteristics of cosmic phenomena.",

      "question": "Are there radiant, glowing planetary rings encircling the elephant’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are multiple cosmic and stellar elements incorporated into the elephant, there do not appear to be any distinct, radiant glowing planetary rings encircling the elephant’s legs specifically. The legs have patterns and textures similar to the rest of the body but do not have ring structures seen as encircling.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B indicate the elephant's feet feature luminescent star patterns. These patterns appear to glow visibly and add to the overall cosmic theme of the edited image, portraying a vibrant outer space-like motif on the elephant.",
