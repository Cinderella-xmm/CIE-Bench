      "question": "Are the bicycles depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles appear in a simplified, cartoonish manner with bold and exaggerated features, resembling a 3D chibi style often characterized by enhanced and rounded shapes. The use of bright colors and simplified design elements contributes to this impression. A chibi style typically exaggerates features in a playful manner, which is evident here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the bicycles retained their original arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the bicycles appears almost identical to how they are displayed in Image A. They are placed in a similar sequence and orientation, which suggests that the spatial arrangement has been preserved across both images.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the bicycles identical to those in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features bicycles in red, blue, beige, and black. In Image B, while there is a red and alternative blue bicycle, the beige turns into white, and the black bicycle is absent, suggesting a significant change in color alterations or omissions.",

      "question": "Do the bicycles retain their original design details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles have lost significant detail due to the 3D chibi style that simplifies and exaggerates features. For example, detailed elements like saddle style, chain mechanisms, and intricate handlebar designs from Image A are not present in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Is the overall scene composition and lighting consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition, with bicycles in front of a large window and the reflection on the floor, remains similar between both images. However, the lighting in Image B is more exaggerated, with fewer shadows and a more uniform glow, differing from the detailed shadows and realistic lighting in Image A.",
