      "question": "Has the body of the teapot been transformed into a sleek cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a canister with a sleek cylindrical shape, distinguished by its tall, straight sides, unlike a traditional teapot's rounded form. Based on this observation, the body of the teapot from Image A appears to have been edited to take on a cylindrical shape in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dragon engravings still present and visibly detailed on the body of the canister?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canister features dragon engravings that are still visible and detailed on its surface, although they are visually distinct from the sculpted engravings on the original teapot in Image A. The presence of these dragon motifs suggests that the theme has been retained, albeit in a different style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the original hinged lid been replaced with a metallic screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the canister topped with a metallic screw cap, which has visible threading that is typical of screw lids. This contrasts with Image A, where the teapot lid is more ornate and not designed as a screw cap. The presence of the screw cap in Image B indicates a change from the original hinged design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are intricate tea leaf patterns embossed around the circumference of the screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the metallic screw cap does not contain intricate tea leaf patterns around its circumference. It appears smooth without any detailed embossing, contrary to the description.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" visibly inscribed along the length of the spout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text \"Dragon's Delight\" is prominently printed on the body of the canister rather than on any spout. Given the design of the canister, there is no spout present, making the inscription along a spout impossible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a minimalist tea leaf logo located on the top center of the screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the minimalist tea leaf logo is actually located on the side of the canister, above the text \"Dragon's Delight,\" rather than on the top center of the screw cap. Thus, the logo's placement does not match the description.",
