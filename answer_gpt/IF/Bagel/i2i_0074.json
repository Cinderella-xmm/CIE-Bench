      "question": "Is there a visible main cover title that reads \"Ideal Home\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, at the top of the image, there is a prominent text in large red letters that reads 'IDEAL HOME'. This placement and styling indicate it is intended as the main title of the page, similar to how magazine titles are typically displayed at the top of a cover.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are various blocks and lines of text positioned around the main image. However, rather than being readable or meaningful headings, they consist mostly of scrambled or gibberish text that does not clearly relate to home design or specific magazine sections.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, there are no clearly identifiable text modules that are providing price recommendations. The text present is not legible or coherent, adhering to nonsensical strings rather than conveying actual information such as price details.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bed, furniture, and decor visible are the same as those in the original Image A. The core elements such as the bed, nightstands, lamps, painting, and other decor have been visually preserved, indicating no alteration to these particular elements has occurred in the editing process.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is clear that an arrangement mimicking a magazine cover is attempted with the title 'IDEAL HOME' at the top, and various blocks and lines of text surrounding the main image. Despite the nonsensical nature of these texts, the overall layout and positioning suggest an attempt at a magazine-like format.",
