        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs exhibit the characteristic features of LEGO bricks, including visible studs and the interlocking pattern typical of LEGO construction. The texture and modular appearance indicate the use of LEGO pieces. Common knowledge of LEGO bricks and their design confirms these visual cues.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tabletop and chair seats in Image B have a clear interlocking pattern indicative of LEGO brick construction. The visible lines and studs are consistent with LEGO’s modular construction approach, where bricks fit together to create larger structures.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the center of the table in Image B, there is a green element that appears to be constructed from LEGO bricks, resembling a plant. The color and shape suggest it is meant to simulate a small plant using LEGO’s modular pieces.",
