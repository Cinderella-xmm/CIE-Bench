      "question": "Is the central figure in the edited image now a robot horse rather than a biological horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure appears to be a mechanical four-legged creature with a metallic appearance, rather than an organic animal. The structure and shine of the creature's body suggest a robotic design. Hence, based on visual cues and world knowledge of robotic creations, the figure resembles a robot rather than a biological horse.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image maintain the same posture as the original horse, with its head lowered as if grazing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biomechanical horse is positioned with its head forward, maintaining a posture similar to that seen in Image A where the cow's head is forward, suggesting a cautious walk rather than grazing. The poses are comparable in terms of direction and body orientation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have a silver-white metallic shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the biomechanical horse with a surface that shines and has a reflective quality consistent with a silver-white metallic shell. This is inferred from the bright highlights and metallic sheen visible in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exposed joint mechanisms visible on the biomechanical horse in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the legs and joints of the biomechanical horse with visible, articulated structures that suggest mechanical joints, common in robotic designs. This indicates exposed mechanisms typically associated with robotic creations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have glowing red sensor eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biomechanical horse is seen with eye-like structures that appear to be glowing with a red hue, suggestive of sensor technology commonly used in robotics, especially for eyes.",
