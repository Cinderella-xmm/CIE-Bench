      "question": "Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bears have a surface texture that consists of numerous small pieces that resemble tiles, forming a mosaic pattern. This gives the appearance of mosaic figurines and mimics fur texture through the arrangement of these tiles. Recognizing mosaic art typically involves identifying the use of small, colored materials laid out in patterns, and this is evident in the visual cues from Image B.",

      "question": "Have the knitted sweaters been replaced with intricate tile patterns in yellow and turquoise hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bears' shirts are composed of a complex pattern of brightly colored tiles, including yellow and turquoise pieces. This transformation from a fabric material, likely used in a knitted sweater in Image A, to a tiled representation suggests that the shirts originally intended as knitted garments have indeed been substituted with tile patterns.",

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, snout) recreated using subtly shaded tiles to provide detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are delineated by strategically placed tiles that vary in shade and color to create detail and depth for the eyes, nose, mouth, and snout areas. This technique in tile art gives the details necessary for facial recognition and expression, evident in the teddy bearsâ€™ expressions as seen in the image.",

      "question": "Do the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles that contrast with the mosaic texture of the rest of the bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bows in Image B exhibit a different surface texture; they appear shiny and smooth compared to the rest of the bear which has a typical mosaic texture made of smaller tiles. This sort of textural differentiation is common in art for highlighting and emphasizing certain features, creating contrast between the glossy bows and the tiled texture of the bears.",

      "question": "Are the mosaic bears positioned on a minimalistic white pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base that supports the mosaic bears is distinctly minimalistic and white, indicative of a pedestal. Such presentation is typical in art displays to bring focus to the artwork itself. The simplicity of the pedestal in color and design contrasts against the complex and colorful mosaic pattern of the bears on it.",
