      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit a 3D style with depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image prominently features a kitten that seems to be jumping towards the viewer. The paws are reaching out, and the body exhibits a level of depth that suggests a three-dimensional effect. This style mimics a 3D approach by giving the viewer an illusion of the kitten coming out of the image. These cues, combined with common knowledge of 3D imagery, indicate a 3D style with depth perception.",

      "question": "Does the edited image depict the kitten as actively jumping out of the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the kitten's position and stretched-out paws create a visual effect where it seems to be leaping forward towards the viewer. This illusion aligns with the common understanding of a subject 'jumping out' in a 3D context. The placement of its paws and the position of its body enhance this sensation of motion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 3D effect in the image achieved without requiring special glasses or external devices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image achieves its 3D effect through perspective and composition rather than requiring external devices such as glasses. The depth is visually simulated by the positioning of the kitten, which is typical of pictures designed to give a 3D-like effect without additional tools, demonstrating an understanding of creating depth through artistic techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the kitten's original appearance, including color and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the blurred face, the ears and paws of the kitten appear to retain the same color and texture as the original image. The fur color is consistent with the typical reddish-orange hue known from the original, and the texture seems to preserve its soft and fluffy appearance, consistent with a ginger tabby kitten. These visual elements support the maintenance of its original appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's features still clearly visible and not obscured by the 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image reveals the kitten's ears and paws clearly, with the 3D effects enhancing rather than obscuring them. The paws are in focus and detailed, and the ears maintain clarity despite the kitten's leaping position, indicating that the 3D effect is well integrated and does not detract from the kitten's features.",
