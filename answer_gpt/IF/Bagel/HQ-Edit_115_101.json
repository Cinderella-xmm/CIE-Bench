      "question": "Has the pocket watch been transformed into a cylindrical glass vessel resembling a whiskey bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is clearly a bottle with a rounded base and a narrow neck, which is typical of glass vessels such as whiskey bottles. This contrasts with the circular pocket watch shown in Image A. The transformation from a circular watch to a cylindrical bottle shape is evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ornate engravings from the original watch visible as embossed patterns on the surface of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image A features a pocket watch with intricate, ornate engravings. Image B shows a bottle with similarly styled embossed patterns on its surface. The designs on the bottle appear to mirror the ornate nature observed on the pocket watch, though they are adapted to fit the bottle's shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the center of the bottle labeled with the text \"Timeless Reserve\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle displays a label at its central area with the text that reads 'Timeless Reserve'. This is a straightforward observation from the edited image, as the label text is prominent and legible.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are Roman numerals arranged in a circular pattern around the edge of the \"Timeless Reserve\" label?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of Image B reveals that the area around the 'Timeless Reserve' label does not display Roman numerals in a circular arrangement. Instead, the focus is on the label itself and the surrounding embossed designs. I also used the world knowledge that Roman numerals are often used in designs involving timepieces, yet they are not present on the bottle.",

      "question": "Has the top ring been transformed into a bottle cap with a visible cork stopper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, there is a looped top ring typically found on pocket watches. Image B shows a bottle with a bottle cap at the top, featuring a cork stopper, which is commonly used in whiskey and other liquor bottles. This indicates the transformation of the top ring into a bottle cap with a cork.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible gold accents on the bottle, particularly on the cap, label, or embossed designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the bottle's design, particularly the label and some sections of the embossing, have a gold-like appearance. The color scheme and the metallic sheen seen in parts of the bottle design are suggestive of gold accents. This choice follows a common aesthetic for premium or reserved edition bottles, aligning with the name 'Timeless Reserve'.",
