      "question": "Has the diffuse, smoky brown background been replaced with an expansive blackboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly features a filled black surface with various white markings and drawings. These are typical elements found on a blackboard, especially in academic or scientific contexts. By comparison, Image A has a diffuse, smoky brown background. The presence of these academic markings strongly suggests that in Image B, the background is indeed intended to represent a blackboard.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blackboard intricately covered with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a blackboard covered with various symbols, formulas, and cosmic sketches. These elements correspond to what is typically associated with advanced scientific topics, such as relativity, and are often visually represented with mathematical equations and space-related drawings. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the chalk markings on the blackboard include scientific equations and galactic imagery.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple remain consistent after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the lighting is warm and diffused, casting a soft glow on Einstein and the pineapple. In Image B, despite the change in background, the lighting on these subjects remains consistent, suggesting that the illumination has not changed with the introduction of the blackboard.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the blackboard exhibit an aged appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An aged blackboard might show signs of wear such as faded spots, cracks, or other indicators of use over time. In Image B, the blackboard appears visually clean and uniformly dark, with bright white chalk markings adding vibrancy; it lacks any indicators of age such as fading or deterioration.",

      "question": "Have the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the composition featuring Einstein and the pineapple appears consistent. The lighting, angles, and positioning relative to each other and to the frame seem unchanged from Image A to Image B. The primary alteration in Image B is the background, which does not affect their positioning or appearance.",
