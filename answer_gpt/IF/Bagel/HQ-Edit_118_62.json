      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plush pigeon with a distinctly vibrant blue chest and gray wings.

      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable contrast between the textures. The pigeon is soft and has a plush texture, while the cookie-like architectural forms have a hard and embossed appearance. This is a common visual contrast found when placing soft toys against harder textured objects, enhancing the distinct characteristics of each.",
