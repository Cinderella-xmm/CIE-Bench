      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are depicted in a style reminiscent of Japanese woodblock prints, which often feature bold calligraphic outlines to define shapes and add contrast. The visual cue of thick black lines around the dolls suggests this artistic style. In contrast, Image A shows real-life dolls without such outlines, as they are naturally rendered in a three-dimensional space. The logic is based on recognizing the characteristic feature of traditional Japanese art.",

      "question": "Are the dolls' clothing and hair depicted using flat planes of color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has transitioned to an illustrative aesthetic that relies on large, flat areas of color, lacking gradients or shading, which is typical of certain graphic art styles. This results in a simplified depiction of clothing and hair. Image A depicts actual dolls in a store, with texture and shading rendering their clothing and hair, providing more depth and realism. The comparison highlights the shift from a realistic depiction to a stylized artistic one.",

      "question": "Has the store environment been replaced with a subtly patterned, simplified background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be simplified into a pattern with calligraphic elements and flat colors, evoking a traditional Japanese screen or wallpaper. This is a departure from the detailed, realistic store setting in Image A, which includes visible shelves and merchandise. The change to a patterned background in Image B is apparent and fits within the artistic transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position and attire of the doll in the foreground seem consistent with a ballet pose, with arms raised and a skirt that resembles a tutu skirt, in line with a stylized representation. Despite the change in artistic style, the fundamental pose and attire remain recognizable, mirroring the ballet pose from Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seated doll in Image B is shown wearing an outfit that is visually consistent with a pink top, sitting on a brightly colored mat that matches the position and color tones of those seen in Image A. Despite the artistic shift, these elements have been preserved in structure and color, allowing for continuity in recognition.",
