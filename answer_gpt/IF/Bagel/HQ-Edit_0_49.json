      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is visibly placed within a transparent structure that appears to be a glass dome. The enclosing element creates a clear boundary around the teapot, consistent with the appearance of it being within a dome. This is concluded by observing the rounded, clear lines and reflections that conform to the shape of the dome around the teapot.",

      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot resting on a wooden-look base marked with 'Amber'. While this base does have a polished, shiny appearance, it doesnâ€™t display the qualities of a mirror, such as distinct reflections of the teapot or cups. Therefore, it doesn't appear to be a reflective mirrored base.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed small cups positioned around the base of the teapot. They are arranged in a circular formation, and their size and appearance suggest that they are intended to be porcelain or ceramic.",

    {

      "question": "Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a teapot covered in intricate engravings that appear to be highly detailed, embellishing the surface with an elegant design. These patterns enhance the existing embellishments on the teapot's surface, giving the appearance of additional detailed work.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct spirals visible above the teapot that resemble the appearance of steam. These spirals are aesthetically designed to give the impression of steam rising from the teapot, with curved, wispy trails.",
