      "question": "Is the central body of the drone redesigned to resemble a robotic face with sharp, angular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the drone indeed presents a structure that resembles a robotic face, characterized by sharp, angular features. This similarity to a face is accentuated by the layout of its components, giving it a more humanoid or robotic appearance. In light of this visual inference, the central body does appear to have been redesigned with these facial characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rotor blades replaced with arm-like structures that appear to be capable of rotation and are positioned as if in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original rotor blades are repositioned as arm-like structures extending from the body. These structures deviate from traditional blades by exhibiting jointed appendages reminiscent of limbs that imply motion and functionality beyond simple rotation, reinforcing the idea that they've been substituted with arm-like components.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original landing gears replaced with multiple spider-like mechanical legs extending from the drone’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the landing gear has been transformed into multiple limb-like extensions that remarkably resemble spider legs. These new appendages suggest a spider-inspired design, differing significantly from typical flat landing gear, indicating a distinct redesign towards a more arachnid aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the character shown in mid-flight above a detailed futuristic cityscape with high-rise buildings and advanced urban elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the character in an airborne position above a cityscape that appears modern and futuristic, populated with high-rise buildings and features indicative of advanced technology, attributable to sophisticated architectural forms, supporting environments reflecting a curated future urban setting.",

      "question": "Does the character exhibit a sleek metallic surface with reflective textures, chrome finishes, or glowing highlights indicating a metallic aura?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character does possess a glossy metallic sheen with some reflective qualities and glowing eyes, indicative of a metallic or cybernetic composition. These glowing highlights convey an impression of technology and futuristic materials commonly associated with chrome and polished finishes.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble present with the text “Secure the Quantum Core!” written in a bold, tech-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B contain text. However, rather than the precise phrase 'Secure the Quantum Core!', the text reads 'Secrre the Quumman Core!' and 'Suerce Qumeam Core!' in a similar font style. This suggests a play on words or modification of the expected phrase, not an exact match.",
