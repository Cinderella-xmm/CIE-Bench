    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the scene appear as a digitally rendered holographic installation with visible projection-like effects such as transparency, layering, or digital glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene features vibrant, neon-like colors and elements that appear transparent or semi-transparent, giving a sense of layering and depth typical of holographic displays. Additionally, the glowing outlines and bright, unnatural colors suggest digital rendering, commonly seen in holographic installations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as animated light projections on transparent or reflective glass surfaces instead of natural flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls present glowing, digital textures and bright neon colors rather than the natural appearance of water. They seem to be projected onto clear surfaces, creating visual effects akin to animated light projections rather than natural waterfalls.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees feature visible iridescent, glowing filaments resembling fiber optics embedded within their trunks and branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B show brightly glowing, multicolored filaments which resemble fiber optics, weaving through trunks and branches. These unnatural glowing elements suggest a synthetic digital effect instead of natural tree features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines appear as virtualized, looping structures with light trails or animated effects, forming a kinetic light sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines are depicted with vivid, glowing lines and loops, appearing dynamic and animated as if part of a kinetic sculpture. This treatment aligns with virtualized effects, including light trails that are typically seen in digital art installations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the environment integrated with futuristic architectural elements such as glass panels, geometric structures, or artificial lighting that blend with the natural forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates clear and defined geometric glass panels and artful artificial neon lighting that interacts with natural forms, presenting a seamless integration characteristic of futuristic architectural design.",
