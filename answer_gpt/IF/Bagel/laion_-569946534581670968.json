      "question": "Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the items displayed appear to be plush toys rather than real chicken wings. These objects have a uniform golden-brown hue and are likely made from a fabric that mimics the appearance but not the texture of chicken wings. World knowledge dictates that plush toys are made of soft materials such as fabric or felt, which differ from the typically crispy texture seen in fried chicken wings. The visual cues strongly suggest that these are indeed plush replicas.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sauce replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bright orange object that resembles a pillow and seems to take the place of where the sauce was in Image A. The pillow has a fluffy texture, and its color aligns with a soft and fabric-filled product. Based on the usual characteristics of sauce (which is liquid), a comparison suggests that the soft, textured item is indeed a pillow.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene set on a smooth, light-colored wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a light-colored wooden surface, which appears smooth and uniform, suggesting it is indeed a wooden texture. Compared with the usual textures, surfaces that are smooth and light-colored typically correspond to wood. Therefore, it can be concluded that the entire scene is set on a wooden surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the plush wings and the orange pillow arranged in the same spatial configuration as the original chicken wings and sauce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spatial configuration in Image B places the plush toy replicas where the chicken wings were initially positioned in Image A and positions the orange pillow in the general area of the sauce. However, the specific arrangement of individual wings and sauce may have slight variations owing to the changed nature of the objects. Using world knowledge and the observation of Image A's classic arrangement for serving food, it is reasonable to say that while there are replacements, they maintain the same broader pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the plush wings and pillow clearly appear as fabric-based toys rather than real food items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on observation, the items in Image B display characteristics typical of fabric-based toys such as a consistent color, soft texture, and seams that suggest they are sewn, not cooked. These visual features are markedly different from real food items like chicken wings or sauce, which have uneven textures and variable coloring. Additionally, world knowledge allows understanding that such plush toys are actual products designed to mimic the appearance, not the texture or realism, of food items.",
