    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the forest background been replaced with a city balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a cityscape with a blurred skyline, which is indicative of an urban setting, unlike the natural forest or woodland setting present in Image A. The presence of a railing in Image B further supports the conclusion that the background has been changed to a balcony or urban environment.",

      "question": "Is the bird positioned on the sunlit balcony as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is perched on a branch-like railing which is consistent with the suggestion of it being a balcony in an urban setting. The lighting in Image B has a sunlit quality, suggesting that the bird is on a sunlit balcony.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a blurred city skyline, which is indicative of an urban environment. This is in contrast to Image A's natural forest background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Images A and B, the bird is positioned similarly on the branch, with its beak open, making it apparent that the main subject's position has been retained despite the change in background to a balcony railing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B has a bright, sunlit quality, indicating that it matches the description of a sunlit balcony setting. The warm light and soft shadows are consistent with direct sunlight typically found on a bright balcony.",
