      "question": "Has the hairstyle been transformed into a swirling, fluffy cotton candy form with pastel pink and blue hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the hairstyle appears to be absolutely transformed into a stylized form resembling cotton candy, with swirls and fluffy texture in pastel pink hues. The logic stems from the recognizable structure that evokes the essence of cotton candy, a common element in visual art where softness and vibrancy are expressed in candy-like colors. The reasoning process combines the analysis of shape and color typical for artistic representation of cotton candy.",

      "question": "Has the suit been replaced with a stylized 3D paper doll version featuring a glossy surface and bold geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the figure wearing an outfit that can be interpreted as a stylized version reminiscent of a 3D paper doll due to its smooth, glossy surface and bold geometric styling. The rectangular and angular shapes along with a more defined and vibrant color scheme align with the characteristics of a paper doll dress-up style, often portrayed with exaggerated features and a sheen that suggests a crafted texture.",

      "question": "Has the tie been replaced with an oversized, cartoon-style element featuring bright, contrasting colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tie in Image B is depicted with exaggerated proportions and vibrant colors that stand out, consistent with a cartoon-style representation. Bright colors like yellow and red are used, which are commonly used in animated or stylized visual works where emphasis is placed on contrast and vividness to represent cartoon-like features.",

      "question": "Have the facial features and expression of the person remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without revealing details about Image A, it is evident from Image B that the facial features and expressions are altered with a blurred edit applied to the face area. Generally, this signifies that the original facial details have been modified, contradicting the notion of unchanged features or expressions. The reasoning is based on visible enhancement that suggests modification contrary to realism.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all modified elements (hair, clothing, tie) visually consistent with their respective stylized forms (cotton candy, paper doll, cartoon) and not mixed with realistic details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates cohesive conversion where each element—hair, clothing, tie—conforms to its stylized form, entirely distinct from realistic details. The hair aligns with cotton candy styling, the clothing suits paper doll aesthetics, and the tie reflects cartoon-like vibrancy, ensuring each part respects its creative metaphor and maintains consistency without realistic interference.",
