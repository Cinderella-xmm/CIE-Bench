    "Question": "Q1: Is the building's facade composed of visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building's facade is clearly altered to have a blocky and textured appearance reminiscent of LEGO bricks. The entire structure appears as if it is constructed from large, colorful blocks commonly identifiable with LEGO toys. The visual cues strongly suggest a transformation from a traditional building surface to one emulating a LEGO aesthetic. Therefore, based on these observations and the evident blocky design, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the building’s bricks rendered in muted red tones and the window frames in muted blue tones?",
    "explanation": "Image B features prominent use of vivid red and blue tones. The bricks of the building are altered to display a bright and vibrant red color, while the window frames are surrounded by intense blue tones. These colors are far from muted and showcase a playful and exaggerated LEGO-style color scheme. Upon observing the strong and saturated color choices, the indication is that these tones are not muted. Hence, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Have the climbing plants been replaced with green, segmented LEGO-style vines?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the climbing plants on the building are altered to appear like LEGO structures. They retain a segmented appearance consistent with LEGO pieces used to imitate foliage. The green color is bright, and the shape is consistent with a stylized LEGO aesthetic, resembling interlocking bricks forming vines. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do all balconies feature gray, blocky LEGO-style railings instead of realistic metal or decorative designs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the balconies display railings that appear to be made from blue LEGO bricks, maintaining the blocky and distinctly LEGO-like design. The railings are not gray but conform to the LEGO structure’s style by employing the same color scheme and block-type design. Hence, all balconies veer away from realistic or decorative designs, favoring LEGO-style construction. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform that contrasts with the surrounding environment to highlight its blocky aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "The edited image depicts the building as integrated into the same urban environment as before, without separate platforms or obvious contrasts from its surroundings. The scene retains its initial setting with cars parked on a standard street, not a specialized platform. The image foreground demonstrates the transformed building design rather than situating it on a singular flat, contrasting platform. Thus, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
