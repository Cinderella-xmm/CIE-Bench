      "question": "Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is represented in a manner where the outlines are blocky and the colors are simplified, which is indicative of pixelation. Such characteristics are aligned with the aesthetic commonly found in 8-bit graphics, which often features noticeable pixels due to the low resolution. Thus, the visual cues match the expectations for 8-bit graphics, confirming the presence of pixelation on the mango.",

      "question": "Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table and napkin in Image B appear as flat, simplified shapes with clear edges and reduced detail, lacking the nuanced textures present in higher-resolution images. This minimalist depiction is typical of 8-bit graphics, which rely on basic forms and limited resolution to convey objects. The low-resolution aesthetic in Image B aligns with these characteristics, demonstrating a simplified portrayal.",

      "question": "Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a distinctive use of a few bold colors, which creates high contrast areas and clear segmentation within the image. This restricted use of colors is a hallmark of 8-bit graphics, where the color palette is limited due to hardware constraints. The presence of a limited color range in Image B is consistent with the visual style of 8-bit graphics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and highlights lack gradual transitions and instead are depicted as blocks of flat colors. This flat shading technique reduces the complexity of light interactions on surfaces, providing a stylized look that aligns with the limitations of 8-bit graphics. The simplified representation of light and shadow in Image B thus corresponds to this characteristic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents its composition with an emphasis on basic shapes and stark contrasts, neglecting detailed textures and intricate designs. The simplification is evident in the visual breakdown into fundamental geometric forms, typical of pixel art and 8-bit graphics, which prioritize the representation of essential features over detailed realism. This focus on simplicity supports the observation of a simplified composition in Image B.",
