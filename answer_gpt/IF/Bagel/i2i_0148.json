      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the overall image been given a cinematic appearance akin to a movie poster, with bold colors and dramatic lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features bold and intensified colors with dramatic lighting effects, giving it a vibrant, surreal quality often associated with movie posters. This effect is achieved through heightened color saturation and dynamic lighting, creating a visually striking, larger-than-life aesthetic characteristic of cinematic presentations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections on the cars enhanced, making them appear more glossy and shiny compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars exhibit heightened reflections and increased glossiness, achieved through digital enhancement that amplifies light reflections on their surfaces. This gives the vehicles a more polished and shiny appearance compared to the more subdued reflections found in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an increased level of environmental haze present in the image, creating a hazy effect around the surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays vibrant and clear background elements with enhanced color saturation rather than increased haze. The environmental elements, such as trees and traffic lights, remain crisp, suggesting no increase in haze effect compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the contrast enhanced in the image, resulting in sharper differences between light and dark areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits heightened contrast with more distinct separations between highlights and shadows. This enhancement contributes to a more dramatic visual effect, with sharper differences in tones compared to the original Image A, where the contrast appears more natural and subdued.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and styling of the image evoke a sense of tension and confrontation, possibly through the positioning of the cars or the use of shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of Image B, with two cars closely side by side and intense color gradients, creates a dramatic, competitive tension. The pronounced styling and enhanced contrast in lighting can impart a sense of confrontation, akin to a race or showdown scene, reinforcing a narrative tension not as apparent in Image A.",
