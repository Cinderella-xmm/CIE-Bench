      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The athlete in Image B is illustrated with anime-style characteristics, which include exaggerated features and vibrant colors.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the athlete's pose been kept the same as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete is depicted in a more dynamic, action-oriented pose characteristic of anime art, with a focus on a mid-swing movement. In contrast, Image A shows a more static pose where the athlete is crouched low, prepared for the next move. This significant change in pose indicates that the dynamic nature typical in anime-style art has been applied in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the athlete have enhanced facial expressions with focused eyes and light effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is blurred, typically in anime-style illustrations like the one depicted in Image B, characters often have expressive facial features with exaggerated eyes that convey emotion and intensity. Additionally, light effects around the eyes or face are commonly used to enhance these expressions. Hence, it can be reasonably inferred that Image B likely follows these conventions.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features bright, radiating lines reminiscent of in-motion or energy effects typically used in anime illustrations to accentuate movement or power. This stylistic choice is frequently employed to give illustrations a dynamic and lively appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the athlete as a character with a highlighted background and framed design elements that resemble the aesthetic used in collectible character cards or banners often found in anime and gaming culture. The layout supports this identification with a focus on the character and dynamic artwork.",
