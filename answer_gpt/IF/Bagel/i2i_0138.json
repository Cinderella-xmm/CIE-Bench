      "question": "Has the word \"Sharp\" been added at the top left of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Sharp' is prominently visible in a stylized font at the top left corner. Visual cues in the image clearly show the presence of text in that location, and common knowledge about the editing of images suggests that such elements are typically added for emphasis or branding.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Clean' appears prominently at the bottom right in a stylized form. Based on visual examination and knowledge of textual enhancement in image editing, it is apparent that this text was added to convey a specific theme or message associated with the object in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the words \"Sharp\" and \"Clean\" styled as a rough sketch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The words 'Sharp' and 'Clean' in Image B have a casual, hand-drawn appearance, almost resembling a cartoon or rough sketch style. This type of font is intended to give a more artistic and informal look, consistent with common art styles identified as sketches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a professional and relevant look for a hairdressing tools brand ad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines artistic text with the image of scissors in a manner that is visually appealing and conveys qualities like precision (Sharp) and hygiene (Clean), which are desirable in professional hairdressing contexts. The edited elements do not detract from the overall focus on the product, thus retaining its professional relevance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any elements added or altered in the image other than placing \"Sharp\" and \"Clean\" as specified in the instructions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No\n```",
      "explanation": "Aside from the addition of the words 'Sharp' and 'Clean,' Image B also appears to have a more stylized texture and contrast applied to the scissors and background, giving it a more graphic, high-contrast look. This suggests additional edits beyond just text placement to enhance overall visual impact.",
