      "question": "Has the image been converted into a realistic cartoon rendering style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck and surroundings are depicted with flat colors and no textures, typical of a cartoon style. The details are simplified and the colors are bold and uniform. This is a departure from the more richly detailed and textured original image often characteristic of realistic styles, explaining that it has indeed been converted into a cartoon style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The truck in Image B maintains the same basic form and features as seen in Image A, such as the cab shape, exhaust pipes, and wheel arrangements. The colors and details may be different, but the overall structure and recognizable components emphasize that the essential shape and parts are retained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines outlining the truck components are more pronounced and clear compared to Image A, where details are less emphasized due to realistic shading and gradient transitions. This bold linework is a common feature in cartoon-style art, making them more visible and distinct.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are very vibrant and saturated, distinguishing them from the more natural and subdued tones in Image A. This vibrant coloration is a hallmark of cartoon illustrations, aiming to catch attention through bright and contrasting colors.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is simplified with large areas of single colors without intricate leaf details or realistic textures as seen in Image A. The trees and sky have less detail and serve as a backdrop rather than detailed elements. This simplification is typical for cartoon-style renderings.",
