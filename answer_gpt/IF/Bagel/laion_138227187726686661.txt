    "Question": "Q1: Is the bedspread composed of multicolored LEGO-style blocks arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bedspread is clearly made up of various colored LEGO bricks arranged in a patchwork pattern. These bricks are recognizable due to their distinct LEGO design, which includes multiple colors and the LEGO stud configuration on top. This arrangement mimics the typical look of a patchwork quilt, but using LEGO bricks instead.",
    "answer": "Yes"
