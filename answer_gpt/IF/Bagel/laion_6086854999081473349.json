      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin visibly transformed into bark-covered limbs with naturalistic textures and irregular shapes resembling tree trunks or branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the walls of the structure appear to be transformed into designs that mimic tree trunks or branches. The texture is rough and irregular, similar to real tree bark, and the shapes are woven and twisted like natural limbs or vines, rather than the straight lines typical of man-made structures. This transformation gives the impression of the structure being part of the forest, suggesting a deliberate effort to integrate with the natural environment.",

      "question": "Have the original windows been replaced with eye-shaped features that emit a glowing amber light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that where the windows would traditionally be located, there are now eye-shaped features emitting a vibrant green light, not amber. The luminescence suggests a mystical or supernatural element, enhancing an enchanted or haunted atmosphere. Comparing with Image A, the original had standard square gaps for windows, confirming this transformation.",

      "question": "Does the roof appear as a leafy canopy composed of green leaves and branches, extending upward beyond the original roof structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof in Image B is covered with what seems to be a layer of green material resembling moss or foliage, giving it the appearance of a leafy canopy. While it mirrors the shape of the original roof (Image A), it does not extend upward beyond the original structure significantly but does give the sense of a natural canopy.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire surface of the cabin appears covered with elements that seem to represent vines and moss. These features are strategically positioned along the cabinâ€™s surfaces, such as the roofline and corners, adding to the organic, overgrown aesthetic typical of a structure intertwined with nature.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several symbols and markings on the cabin's surface, which resemble mystical or rune-like carvings. These are visibly etched along the vertical parts of the structure and have no counterpart in Image A, suggesting a thematic shift towards a magical or enchanted appearance.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire lower section where the garage doors were in Image A is transformed to display faces with expressions that look like stylized or mythical entities.
