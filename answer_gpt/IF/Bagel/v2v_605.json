      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the gorilla is enclosed within a box that closely resembles the design of Funko Pop boxes. This is characterized by its isometric presentation, showcasing an angled view of the box that reveals multiple sides including the front and part of one side of the packaging.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the chibi figure of the gorilla inside the box is accessorized with a leafy crown and holds a wooden staff. These elements, along with additional jungle-themed details such as leafy attire, contribute to the thematic appearance referencing a jungle environment. These accessories are not only visually apparent but also reinforce the packaging theme of 'JUNGLE KING'.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B shows no realistic illustration of the gorilla figure outside the box. The only depiction of the gorilla is in chibi form within the packaging, which lacks the detailed textures and sophisticated lighting present in realistic illustrations. This aligns with the typical presentation of collectible figures, where the box design focuses on branding and character appeal through simplified graphics.",
