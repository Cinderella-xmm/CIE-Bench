      "question": "Has the train been transformed into a futuristic maglev train design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train features a streamlined design with a sleek, aerodynamic body, which are common characteristics of futuristic maglev trains. Maglev trains are known for their smooth, curvilinear shapes intended for high-speed travel, reducing air resistance. The elements such as the design of the nose, the smooth and reflective surface, and the absence of visible wheels further enforce the sense of a futuristic train commonly associated with maglev technology.",

      "question": "Does the train retain the original white and red color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a train with a predominantly white body complemented by red accents. This color scheme resonates with the classic and modern train designs that commonly use contrasting colors for visual appeal and branding purposes. The presence of these colors suggests that the train retains the original white and red color scheme.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the train incorporate elements indicative of maglev technology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B has no visible wheels or tracks, suggesting the concept of levitation typical in maglev designs. Maglev trains utilize magnetic forces to float above the track, resulting in faster speeds and smoother journeys. The design elements such as the absence of mechanical undercarriages and the sleek form contribute to its perception as using maglev technology.",

      "question": "Does the train still appear recognizable as a train despite the futuristic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even with its transformed, futuristic aesthetic, the silhouette and design features such as the elongated shape, streamlined front, and window placement, are still coherent with the general appearance of trains, allowing for recognition as a train.",

      "question": "Have all parts of the original train been transformed into the new maglev design, with no elements of the old design remaining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train has undergone a complete transformation into a futuristic design with all elements reflecting a modern maglev aesthetic, leaving no visible elements of an older train design remaining. The sleek body and absence of conventional train parts indicate a full redesign.",
