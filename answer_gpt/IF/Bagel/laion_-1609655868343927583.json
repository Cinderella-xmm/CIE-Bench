      "question": "Is the marble top replaced by a crown-shaped structure with visible gemstone inlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the topmost part is shaped like a crown on the head of an anthropomorphic figure, which features visible gemstone inlays. This is a significant change from a flat marble top design. The design and placement suggest it is meant to be the crown of the figure, indicating a transformation from the cabinet in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
