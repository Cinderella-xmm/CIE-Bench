      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly designed to resemble an owl. The shape includes owl-like features such as a beak, eyes, and wings, which strongly resemble an owl rather than a teapot. The decorative aspects and structure have been modified to depict an owl's anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lid of the original teapot form the crown-like head of the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the owl is detailed with feathers and a crown-like texture, resembling the intricate carvings found on the top of the teapot in Image A, which was originally the teapot's lid.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original engravings now transformed into metallic feather-like patterns covering the owl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the owl features metallic feather-like patterns that cover its surface, resembling the engravings found on the surface of the teapot in Image A. These patterns have been artistically transformed from the ornamental design of the teapot to simulate feathers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been reshaped into a sharp, mechanical beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the owl includes a beak that appears mechanical and sharp. The shape and positioning suggest that the original spout of the teapot in Image A has been modified to resemble an owl's beak.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle of the original teapot does not appear to have been transformed into a tail. The owl's body is fully formed with features like wings and a prominent tail is not distinctly visible or derived from the handle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's face prominently features two glowing eyes that are composed of cog-like elements. These mechanical eyes are distinctive and convey the owl's mechanical design.",
