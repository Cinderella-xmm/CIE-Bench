      "question": "Are the surfers replaced with pandas holding surfboards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subjects have panda heads on human bodies which are the same bodies holding surfboards as seen in Image A. The alteration involves replacing the surfers' heads with panda heads while maintaining the rest of the body and positioning. Therefore, the surfers themselves are not entirely replaced with pandas, just their heads are altered to resemble pandas.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sunset and beach setting kept intact without any changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background setting, including the ocean, sunset, and the beach, appears to remain unaltered compared to Image A. The differences are limited to the subjects, so the environment itself is preserved as in the original photo.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original surfers, facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures with panda heads are in the same posture and orientation as the surfers in Image A. Both sets of figures stand side by side, facing the sunset, which indicates that their positioning is consistent between the two images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pandas holding surfboards in their paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although in Image B the figures have panda heads, the bodies remain human with human-like hands holding the surfboards. The term 'paws' is not applicable here as the alteration is only in the heads, and the surfboards are held exactly as they were by the human surfers in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the surfboards appear to remain unchanged in terms of color and design, indicating that the modification did not affect these details of the surfboards.",
