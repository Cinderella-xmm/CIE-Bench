      "question": "Is the edited image composed of three distinct panels arranged side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a single illustration of three gymnasts together on a balance beam. It does not present three separate sections or panels; instead, the three figures are part of a unified composition. Thus, the image is not divided into three distinct parts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gymnasts depicted in a semi-realistic cartoon style, with stylized features but retaining human proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnasts are illustrated in a cartoon style that simplifies and stylizes features like faces and limbs while still keeping basic human proportions. This style is typical in semi-realistic cartoons where the figures are recognizable as human but have exaggerated or simplified characteristics.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gymnasts' outfits feature flowy designs that suggest movement, such as draping or trailing fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outfits on the gymnasts in Image B appear fitted and are characterized by their shiny appearance. They do not have draping or flowing fabric that would typically suggest movement. Instead, they have a more form-fitting design.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image earthy tones such as browns, greens, and warm neutrals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the gymnasts' outfits primarily consist of shimmering gradients, such as yellows and browns. While some brown is present in the balance beam and frame, earthy tones are not dominant in the depiction of the gymnasts themselves, but are present enough in the overall image composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible sequined or sparkly patterns on the gymnastsâ€™ outfits that stand out due to texture or reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gymnasts' outfits in Image B have shiny and sparkly appearances, suggesting the presence of sequins or sparkly patterns. These details are designed to stand out and catch the light, similar to costumes often used in performance settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the artwork inside a frame, but it is a simple wooden frame, not a tri-fold design. The color of the frame is dark, resembling walnut, but it does not have the structure or functionality of a tri-fold frame used for tabletop displays.",
