        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is cartoonish and playful, depicting animal characters with speech bubbles, unlike the formal diagram structure of Image A.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pathways in Image B are designed to look like trails or paths often found in storybooks or game boards rather than the directional arrows seen in process diagrams like Image A. This suggests that the illustration has traded formal arrows for playful representations.",

    {
