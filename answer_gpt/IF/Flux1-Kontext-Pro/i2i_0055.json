      "question": "Has the baby elephant been transformed into a cartoon character while keeping the original pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is a cartoon character that resembles an elephant due to its large, rounded ears and gray skin. The character wears the same attire—a yellow hard hat, a high-visibility vest, and similarly colored clothing—as the human in Image A, suggesting that the pose and outfit have been replicated in cartoon form. This indicates a transformation into a cartoon character while retaining the original pose.",

      "question": "Does the cartoon baby elephant exhibit a rounded and cute style with smooth edges and soft features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon baby elephant has features typically associated with a cute and rounded style, such as large, rounded ears, a smooth and streamlined body, and soft, gentle curvatures throughout its form. These characteristics align with the common attributes of cartoon characters designed to be appealing and cute.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the texts “First Splash!” and “Ele-Baby” included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Ele-Baby' is visible at the bottom of the image. However, the phrase 'First Splash!' is not present. Careful observation does not reveal the presence of 'First Splash!', thereby confirming only the inclusion of 'Ele-Baby'.",

      "question": "Is the text “First Splash!” and “Ele-Baby” placed on a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible text 'Ele-Baby' appears over the image without any opaque background, suggesting it is placed directly against the background, effectively being on a transparent layer since there is no discernible backdrop to the text itself. However, 'First Splash!' is not present, so it cannot be evaluated.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image A with Image B, the cartoon baby elephant in Image B maintains the same stance, arm, and leg positions as seen in the human figure in Image A, indicating that the pose has been preserved in the transformation.",
