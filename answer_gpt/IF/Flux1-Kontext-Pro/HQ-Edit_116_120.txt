    "Question": "Q1: Is the sandcastle now presented as a scaled-down, highly detailed miniature 3D model?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle appears to be a detailed and intricate scale model. This is because the lighting and shadowing suggest precision in design and craftsmanship.

    "Question": "Q4: Are fine, glittering grains visibly applied to the surface of the sandcastle to simulate a sandy texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show signs of fine glittering grains on the sandcastle. Instead, the surface looks smooth and polished, not simulating a sandy texture. The model's surface appears consistent with a non-gritty material.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are tiny, ornately detailed seashells placed around the base of the sandcastle model?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are small seashells detailed around the base of the sandcastle model, adding decorative realism to the display. The presence of these suggests an ornamental purpose, complementing the miniature sandcastle.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the entire model and surrounding elements have a soft, matte pearl-like finish?",
