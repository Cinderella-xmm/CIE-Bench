      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress appears to be made of a material that looks similar to cookie dough based on the uniform golden-brown color. The darker edges and corners of the structure give the impression of being baked, as seen in baked cookies. This is a visual cue that indicates the material is designed to resemble cookie dough, consistent with the common appearance of baked goods.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observation in Image B shows that the walls and towers of the fortress have a uniform golden-brown color, with darker edges along some of the corners and outlines. This is characteristic of how baked cookie dough looks, where the edges often darken due to the baking process. This suggests that the fortress is intentionally designed to mimic the look of baked cookie dough.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls appear smooth and glossy, with a texture that resembles the appearance of royal icing. Royal icing can achieve a glossy and smooth surface, often used in cake and cookie decoration to simulate water or other liquids in edible art. This visual information, combined with the context of other elements, suggests that the waterfalls are designed to look like royal icing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees in the image made from smooth, uniformly green-colored marzipan with no realistic leaf detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees have a smooth and uniform green color, with round shapes and no visible leaf details. This texture and color is consistent with marzipan, a confectionery that can be molded into shapes without detailed texture, common in cake decorating. This lack of realistic leaf detail suggests they are intended to represent stylized edible tree representations like those made from marzipan.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cookie castle placed on a large, flat, white ceramic platter that is clearly visible beneath and around the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the entire structure, including the fortress and the surrounding landscape features, is placed on a large, flat, white surface that resembles a ceramic platter. The edge of this platter is visible beneath and around the structure, providing a clear demarcation between the edible elements and the platter, which is typical for displaying decorative edible art.",
