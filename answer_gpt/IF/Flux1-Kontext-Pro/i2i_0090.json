      "question": "Does the edited image show the stapler from both the front and rear views side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stapler is displayed twice: on the left, showing the front view, and on the right, showing the rear view. This arrangement clearly presents both perspectives side by side. Using visual cues, one can identify the typical front features such as the opening for papers to be stapled on one side, and a view from behind showing no such opening on the other side, confirming it is the rear view.",

      "question": "Are the stapler's front and rear views arranged next to each other in a horizontal alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual layout shows the front view on the left and the rear view on the right, which indicates they are placed adjacent to each other horizontally. This has been determined by observing the side-by-side placement, which is a typical horizontal arrangement.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all parts of the stapler visible in both the front and rear views without any truncation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays both the front and rear views fully without any visible cropping or truncation that would cut off parts of the stapler. The entirety of each view is presented in the image from the top down to the base where it rests on the surface.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the front and rear views of the stapler in the edited image match in terms of color and design details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stapler in Image B maintains a consistent color (blue) and design features (shape, style, and metallic parts) across both the front and rear views. The consistency of these visual elements suggests a match in color and design for both views.",

    {

      "question": "Is the background consistent between the front and rear views of the stapler without additional elements introduced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, both portions of the image showing the front and rear views of the stapler share a consistent green background without any additional elements introduced. This uniform background ensures visual consistency in the environment around the stapler.",
