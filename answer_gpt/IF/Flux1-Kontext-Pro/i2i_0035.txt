    "Question": "Q4: Are white outlines visible around the edges of all items on the plate in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the items within the plate visually appear to lack distinct white outlines; they blend naturally with the plate environment, which is standard for realistic food presentation in images.

    "Question": "Q5: Has the image been formatted to fit an A4 vertical layout, ensuring proper alignment of text and imagery?",
