      "question": "Is the background of each sticker transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B have a consistent light grey or off-white background visible behind each sticker. This indicates that the background is not transparent, as a transparent background would typically not display any color or pattern behind the sticker designs.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B are not in a square format. They have diverse shapes due to the design of each sticker around the character, which results in irregular outlines and does not form a 1:1 aspect ratio.",
