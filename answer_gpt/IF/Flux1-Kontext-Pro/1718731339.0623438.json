    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the armored figure visibly smaller in scale compared to its original form, consistent with being a miniature sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figure is enclosed within a glass dome, and the presence of this dome, along with the suspended ornaments, gives the impression of a display piece. This setup suggests a smaller and miniature scale compared to Image A, where the figure is standalone without any such context, indicating a standard human-sized armor. The context of the glass dome and accompanying decorative elements in Image B strongly imply that the figure is now presented as a smaller, collectible sculpture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the armored figure enclosed within a transparent dome featuring metallic structural elements consistent with steampunk design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the armored figure inside a transparent dome. This dome includes elements like ringed, brass-colored objects suspended around it, reminiscent of elements often found in steampunk aesthetics, which are characterized by a mix of old-fashioned metalwork and fantastical technology. The use of metallic gears and suspended spheres around the dome contributes to this aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible rotating cogwheels located at the base of the structure beneath the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the armored figure, there are clearly visible cogwheels at the base. These cogwheels are consistent with steampunk design, which often includes mechanical and gear-based elements as decorative or functional parts. The presence of these cogwheels directly beneath the figure confirms their existence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small mechanical wings attached to the back of the armored figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible small mechanical wings attached to the back of the armored figure. The back features spikes and armor plating but lacks the specific detail of attached wings. Therefore, by visual assessment, the armor does not show mechanical wings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible copper-colored piping details integrated into the surface of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the armor displays complex textures and possible dark red details, there is no visible depiction of copper-colored piping integrated into its surface. The design focuses more on the worn, metallic surfaces and spike elements rather than highlighted piping details.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple spherical brass filigree objects suspended in the air around the figure, mimicking planetary orbits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple brass-colored spherical objects are clearly suspended around the dome. These objects, due to their suspension and arrangement, mimic the visual impression of planets in orbit. The craftsmanship appears intricate, akin to filigree design, giving the suspended spheres a celestial appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the brass filigree orbs arranged in a way that creates a sense of orbiting celestial bodies, contributing to a mystical ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of brass-colored, filigree-like orbs around the enclosed figure in Image B is akin to planetary models, which are often designed to showcase orbits. This positioning and presentation inherently contribute to a mystical ambiance by simulating celestial motion, supporting the theme of otherworldly or fantasy design.",
