      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited version (Image B), the cat is indeed shown in a curled-up posture. This is evident from its body shape and positioning, where it is tightly coiled in a circular formation typical of a cat at rest. By observing the overall body posture and comparing it to common cat resting positions, it is clear that this posture is maintained.",

      "question": "Is the cat's fur represented by simple gradient color blocks in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur is not represented by simple gradient color blocks. Instead, it features detailed texturing with variations in color and shading that suggest individual strands of fur. The presence of texture and detail, rather than flat gradients, indicates that the fur is depicted in a more realistic style.",

      "question": "Has the car been simplified to a curved surface with only reflection lines present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat without the car as the background has been removed, focusing solely on the cat and its detailed features. There is no depiction of a car in the edited version, so it cannot be simplified to a curved surface with reflection lines.",

      "question": "Does the sticker have an irregular shape with a thick white outline and a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sticker indeed has an irregular shape, corresponding to the outline of the curled-up cat, and features a thick white border or outline. This appearance is indicative of common sticker design, which typically includes a border to delineate the sticker shape. The background beyond the cat and outline is a pale grey which may suggest a transparent background in a typical display.",

      "question": "Is the entire image styled in a minimalist illustration manner suitable for a chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) maintains a more detailed representation of the cat rather than stylized minimalist illustration typical of chibi stickers. The fur and posture maintain a degree of realism, and there is texture and shading that wouldn't be present in minimalist chibi art, which tends to use simplified shapes, solid colors, and exaggerated features.",
