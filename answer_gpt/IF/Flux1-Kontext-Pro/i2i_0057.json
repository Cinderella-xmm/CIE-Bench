      "question": "Is the central figure in the edited image now a robot horse rather than a biological horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure features characteristics associated with robots, such as metallic components, mechanical joints, and an overall design that suggests artificial creation rather than biological, leading to the conclusion that it is a robot horse, not a biological horse. In contrast, Image A shows a biological cow with natural animal characteristics such as fur and organic shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image maintain the same posture as the original horse, with its head lowered as if grazing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the robot horse walking on the path with its head lowered, similar to a posture that an animal might take when grazing or walking casually. Image A shows the cow walking with its head up, which indicates the robotic figure mimics a walking posture rather than grazing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have a silver-white metallic shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot horse in Image B has a surface that reflects light and shows the metallic texture associated with metal materials, predominantly in silver-white, signifying a metallic shell. This is evident from the shiny, uniform appearance distinct from organic textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exposed joint mechanisms visible on the biomechanical horse in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot horse visibly displays mechanical joints at the limbs that resemble robotic articulation, contrasting with the natural limb joints of the cow in Image A, confirming the presence of exposed joint mechanisms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have glowing red sensor eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot horse in Image B features eyes that emit a red glow, resembling sensors or electronic eyes typical of robots, which differs from the natural non-glowing eyes of the cow in Image A.",
