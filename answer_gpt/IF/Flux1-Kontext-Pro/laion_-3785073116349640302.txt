    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical globe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evident indication of the scene being enclosed in a transparent spherical globe.

    "Question": "Q2: Are Ultraman and the creature depicted as small, cartoonish chibi figures with large heads and simplified features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, Ultraman and the creature are depicted in a detailed comic book style, showing more realistic proportions rather than exaggerated features typical of chibi figures, which usually include disproportionately large heads and simplified details.

    "Question": "Q3: Do the chibi figures have a shiny, reflective surface suggesting a smooth and glossy material?",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the base of the globe contain a detailed rugged terrain with scattered metallic debris?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a detailed area beneath Ultraman featuring a shipwreck amidst smoke or cloud effects, but it is depicted in a common comic book style and setting rather than as the base of a globe with a terrain theme.
