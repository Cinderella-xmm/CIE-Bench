      "question": "Is the sandwich depicted in a thick-painted cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visuals of the sandwich appear to have a thick, blocky style with bold outlines and simplified colors, which is characteristic of a cartoon-like painting style. The elements in the image, such as the bread and the fillings, show less texture and detail, resembling a painted cartoon rather than a realistic photo.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich cross-section clearly emphasized with distinct textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layers within the sandwich, such as the lettuce, cheese, and meat, lack fine detail and texture. The style focuses more on color blocks with limited textural variation, hence, the cross-sectional details of the sandwich are not clearly emphasized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the lettuce been simplified into smeared green shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce appears as broad smears of green with minimal detail, typical of a simplified artistic style. This smeared appearance gives it an abstract feel, in contrast to the detailed representation of lettuce which would retain more natural texture and shape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Are there sauce decorations added around the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows red circular objects around the sandwich on the plate that resemble sauce decorations. These red dots do not appear in Image A, suggesting they were added in the editing process to augment the appearance.",

      "question": "Does the final image style fit a modern Western restaurant menu visual aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, with its cartoonish, stylized depiction, doesn't align with the typical modern Western restaurant menu aesthetic, which usually prefers high-quality, realistic images showcasing texture and freshness to entice customers. Restaurants usually favor detailed and vibrant food photography rather than this type of exaggerated artistic style.",
