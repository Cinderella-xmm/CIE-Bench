      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B exclusively presents the bedroom scene without any extraneous elements outside of this context. The focus remains on illustrating the interior setting with the bed, lamp, windows, and candles, similar to Image A. It does not introduce any unrelated motifs or objects, which aligns with how enamel pins often focus on a central theme or imagery without unrelated embellishments.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the enamel pin design on a plain white background, creating a stark contrast that emphasizes the pin's design. The format is square with rounded corners, a common presentation for enamel pins that helps ensure the pin's visual elements are evenly distributed within a neat boundary. This setup aids in showcasing the design clearly and is typical for enamel pin mockups.",
