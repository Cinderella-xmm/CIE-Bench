      "question": "Does the oatmeal blend include pet-safe ingredients like salmon bits, pumpkin puree, and oats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal box displays text mentioning 'Salmon' and 'Oats', signifying these are ingredients in the oatmeal blend. However, there is no mention or depiction of 'pumpkin puree'. Since only two of the three ingredients are explicitly mentioned, but not the third, the correct choice is based on confirming that all mentioned ingredients are included.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized drawing of a cat on the cereal box, characterized by bold outlines and simple shading. The design does capture features of a cat's eyes and ears but does not include intricate textures that mimic fur.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background suggests a kitchen setup with a clean countertop and blurred kitchen items. The lighting appears warm and soft, influencing the cozy tone of the image. This combination of visual cues suggests a modern kitchen setup with soft lighting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image on the cereal box in Image B showcases a stylized, cartoonish illustration of a cat that appears to have characteristics of a chibi character, such as large eyes and a cute, simplified design. However, the cat is illustrated in a 2D style rather than 3D. Despite this, the emphasis on expressive eyes and alert ears is still evident.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cereal box with a cute and playful illustration of a cat, suggesting a playful brand identity. The modern kitchen background and soft lighting provide a premium feel, though the design more closely aligns with casual and fun branding. The combination of visual elements attempts to balance playfulness with refinement, yet might not strongly communicate 'high-end'.",
