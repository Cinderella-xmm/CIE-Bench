      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible text 'flyaway' that appears prominently on the surface of the photograph.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'flyaway' is situated on the wooden cabinet's top surface, almost directly under the painting that occupies the wall above the cabinet. This close proximity to the painting, along with its placement horizontally aligned with the painting, indicates that the text is positioned directly below the artwork.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
