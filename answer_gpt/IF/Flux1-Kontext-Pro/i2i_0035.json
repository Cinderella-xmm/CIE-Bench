      "question": "Does the edited image contain the exact title “Today’s Balanced Lunch” at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue shows large, bold text at the top saying 'Today’s Balanced Lunch.' This is clearly readable due to the sharp and well-defined letters and positioned in a prominent top section of the image combined with the visible context emphasizing the meal. This analysis relies on the common understanding of text placement and the communication of key information in graphic design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a placeholder for the school logo located at the bottom right corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a detailed graphical element at the bottom right corner, resembling a school logo or official seal, which is common in promotional or informational graphics presented by educational institutions. The visual style and placement suggest purposeful inclusion rather than a generic placeholder.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the colors in the food and background been visibly enhanced to appear more vivid and bright?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color saturation appears more intense; the blue background for the text has increased vibrancy, while the food items look brighter and more appealing. This typically indicates a graphic enhancement to attract attention and convey freshness, relying on the viewer's common expectation for vivid imagery in promotional materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are white outlines visible around the edges of all items on the plate in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the items within the plate visually appear to lack distinct white outlines; they blend naturally with the plate environment, which is standard for realistic food presentation in images. White outlining would make the items visually pop against the background, but such outlines are not apparent here.",

      "question": "Has the image been formatted to fit an A4 vertical layout, ensuring proper alignment of text and imagery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a square format rather than an A4 vertical layout. The composition centers the plate and associated text within a square image. An A4 vertical layout would typically involve a taller aspect ratio and appropriate spacing adjustments for text alignment, which is not observed here.",
