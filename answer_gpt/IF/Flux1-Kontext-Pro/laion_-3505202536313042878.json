      "question": "Is the couple depicted in a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple is illustrated with a semi-cartoon, stylized appearance characterized by bold outlines and simplified details. This distinct change in style from a photograph to an illustration is evident through the noticeable use of lines and lack of intricate details, which is typical of semi-cartoon portrayals. Commonly, semi-cartoon styles feature less realistic textures and more emphasis on geometric shapes and simplified anatomy.",

      "question": "Are the man's tuxedo and the womanâ€™s fur jacket visibly exaggerated in size or shape compared to their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the semi-cartoon style, the man's tuxedo and the woman's fur jacket maintain their proportions and are not exaggerated in size or shape. This observation is made by noting the consistent representation of the attire in terms of its cut and fit compared to Image A. Although the illustration style may suggest abstraction, the intent to maintain realistic proportions in clothing is present.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background composed of simplified linear representations of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 emblem rather than the original photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase the full detailed backdrop of Image A. Instead, it features an artistic backdrop where the focal point is a framed illustration of the couple. While the full background of logos is out of the primary frame, the alignment with Image A's theme implies an integration of the FIA logo subtly. Image A's complex logo array is simplified through the surrounding context in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a noticeable gold-colored, ribbon-like border framing the illustrated couple. This embellishment is distinct and seeks to emphasize and add a decorative quality to the presentation. Such a border captures attention and encloses the scene elegantly, often used to signify specialty or luxury.",

      "question": "Is the stamp presented on a blue envelope that has a subtle embossed pattern of the FIA Prize Giving 2013 logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration seems to feature a presentation format that uses a blue background, reflecting the presentation like a stamp mounted on a surface. There is a subtle texture to this background indicative of an embossed pattern, aligning with the FIA Prize Giving 2013 thematic elements observed in Image A that incorporates logos and emblems.",
