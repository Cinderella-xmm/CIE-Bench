    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the object resembles an owl with distinct features, such as a head, eyes, and wings, replacing the shape of a teapot seen in the original image (Image A). The transformation from a round, compact teapot to the more vertically designed shape of an owl suggests the overall shape is now an owl.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lid of the original teapot form the crown-like head of the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the top of the owl features a crown-like structure that appears to be positioned where the teapot lid was originally located. This visual transformation indicates that the lid of the teapot has been redesigned into a crown-like element to enhance the owl's head appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original engravings now transformed into metallic feather-like patterns covering the owl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the owl's body exhibits intricate patterns resembling feathers. These designs appear to be repurposed from the original teapot's engravings, which were ornate and covered its surface. The transition from teapot engravings to owl feathers is evident in the similar pattern and texture aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been reshaped into a sharp, mechanical beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the owl's face shows what appears to be a sharp beak, likely redesigned from the teapot's spout. The transformation from the more elongated form of a spout to a pointed, beak-like structure suggests this change.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a gracefully curved tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the handle of the teapot is not explicitly visible as a separate element; however, the design suggests that aspects of the original handle may have contributed to shaping the owl's overall appearance, especially in elements like the tail, though it doesn't appear as a distinctly identifiable tail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two glowing eyes made of cogs visible on the owl's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the owl's face features prominent, mechanically styled glowing eyes, suggesting a design involving cog-like elements to give them a distinct mechanical aesthetic. This transformation from the teapot with no eyes to the owl having cog-like glowing eyes is clearly visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned on a richly carved wooden branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the owl is perched on a branch, which shows detailed carving and a wooden texture. This setting emphasizes the natural environment adaptation, differing from the previous context of the teapot on a flat surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
