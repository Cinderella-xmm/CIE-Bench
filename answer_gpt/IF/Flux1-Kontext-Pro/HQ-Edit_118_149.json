      "question": "Is the ballet dancer's pose represented as two distinct sticker versions in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a journal with two stickers of a ballet dancer performing an arabesque pose. Each sticker has a slightly different angle or orientation, but they are fundamentally similar in representing the same ballet pose. Therefore, the stickers can be considered distinct versions in terms of slight visual differences.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays two stickers, both of which feature smooth, flowing lines typical of a ballet dancer's pose and lack sharp geometric lines or angular forms. These characteristics align more with a classic aesthetic rather than a modern one characterized by sharp angles.",
