      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure bears a strong resemblance to a fantastical creature with a defined body. The central dome is prominently featured as part of the 'head' or main body, and there are additional large, sculpted elements that form limb-like structures, including legs and wings, which are not characteristic of the original Hagia Sophia. This transformation into a creature-like figure is evident from the distinct addition of these imaginative architectural modifications.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the structure shows elaborate, wing-like appendages extending from the sides. These appendages possess intricate designs and a metallic sheen, differing greatly from the smaller domes on the sides of the traditional Byzantine structure seen in Image A. The transformation effectively resembles large wings more than traditional architectural elements, indicating a fantastical reimagining.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features long, slender structures that diverge from the established architectural form of minarets seen in Image A. These structures are positioned to support the overall framework of the fantastical creature, exhibiting jointed, leg-like characteristics rather than the static, linear form of traditional minarets. This transformation is a deliberate modification to enhance the creature-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structure’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual inspection of Image B reveals glowing, intricate patterns that cover parts of the structure’s surface. These patterns are stylized and reminiscent of the elaborate decorations typical of Byzantine art. They add a mystical aura to the creature, echoing the historical and cultural art forms but incorporating a supernatural, luminous quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome is topped with a large, jewel-like object. This object exhibits a radiant, crystalline appearance and is surrounded by cosmic imagery, including stars and other celestial elements. This is a significant departure from the solid, non-luminous dome of the traditional Hagia Sophia, making the structure appear otherworldly and fantastical.",
