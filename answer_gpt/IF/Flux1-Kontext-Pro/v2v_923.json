      "question": "Does the illustration include a full-body depiction of the creature that incorporates elements like scissors, rulers, or pens?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration features a creature which is fully depicted and appears to incorporate themes related to crafting tools and precision, implied by the text descriptions 'Metal Precision Pattern'. However, the creature itself does not visually incorporate elements like scissors, rulers, or pens. The depiction focuses more on the style and thematic representation rather than literal incorporation of these tools.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a small orb or capsule near the creature's feet styled with colors and patterns that reflect elements like gridlines, beige paper, or metallic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an orb located near the creature's feet, styled with metallic colors such as blue and gold. Although it does not directly reflect gridlines or beige paper, the metallic color choice mirrors elements related to crafting, particularly precision tools, consistent with the 'Metal Precision Pattern' theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, there are descriptive labels such as 'Elemental Type’ and ‘Metal Precision Pattern,’ but they do not serve as a unique name for the creature. These terms describe characteristics rather than providing an actual creative name.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B explicitly lists 'Elemental Type' along with descriptors such as 'Metal', 'Precision', and 'Pattern.' These relate to the visual theme and conceptual design of the creature, reflecting crafting and material elements carried over from the tools and patterns seen in Image A.",
