      "question": "Has the wooden material been replaced with transparent blue and teal crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object described is a sculpture that appears to be made of a transparent blue material, resembling glass or crystal, with a visually different texture compared to wooden texture. This suggests the material transition from opaque wood in Image A to a transparent crystalline substance in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the facets and angles of the sculpture accurately represent the fish's scales and curved body structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B is depicted with defined edges and facets that mimic the scales of a fish, along with a smooth curvature that represents the body of the fish effectively. These features are typical for sculptures portraying aquatic themes and are visible in Image B through its 3D form.",

      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit glossy, reflective surfaces that suggest water-like fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B is made of a clear, glass-like material that reflects light, providing it with a glossy finish. This reflective quality is reminiscent of water surfaces, contributing to a fluid, liquid-like appearance, which is a common characteristic in crystalline sculptures designed to mimic aquatic or fluid forms.",
