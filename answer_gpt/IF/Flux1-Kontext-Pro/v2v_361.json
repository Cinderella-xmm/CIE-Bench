      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a hand holding a keychain, as indicated by the fingers and thumb grasping the connector of the keychain.

      "question": "Does the keychain feature a chibi-style depiction of the dog from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain has a cartoonish and exaggerated style of a small dog. Chibi style is commonly a caricature with oversized heads, large eyes, and cute features, all of which can be seen here. The dog shares characteristics with common breeds known for long hair similar to a Yorkie, which appears in Image A. The chibi style often infers a simplified yet recognizable version of a real animal, indicating that the keychain is likely a chibi-style depiction of the dog from Image A.",

      "question": "Is the keychain made of soft rubber with thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The appearance of the keychain in Image B is consistent with typical rubber materials used for keychains. It has a smooth finish that indicates flexibility, and the vivid thick black outlines contribute to the cartoon-like style, which is typical for rubberized items designed to be durable yet soft. These features are visually distinct in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the keychain connected to a tiny silver keyring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top part of the keychain in Image B shows a silver-colored ring connecting the cartoon dog figure to a larger ring. The visual cues such as the metallic sheen and geometric ring shape are characteristic of metal keyrings. Therefore, the keychain appears to be attached to a small silver keyring.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a simple, monochromatic shade that does not contain other objects or details, emphasizing the keychain and hand as the main subjects. This lack of additional visual elements or patterns suggests a neutral backdrop, which is often used in product photography to avoid distractions.",
