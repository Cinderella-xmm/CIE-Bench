        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of the texts 'Breathe' and 'Calm' is such that they appear in the corners of the image. This avoids interfering with the central focus of the plant and window, allowing the observer to fully appreciate the visual composition. The arrangement ensures that the added texts do not block or overshadow the primary visual elements.",
