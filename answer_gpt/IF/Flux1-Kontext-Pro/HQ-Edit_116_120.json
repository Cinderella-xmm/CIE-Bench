    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle now presented as a scaled-down, highly detailed miniature 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle appears to be a detailed and intricate scale model. This is because the lighting and shadowing suggest precision in design and craftsmanship. The significant detail in the structure, with no visible inconsistencies, suggests it’s a miniature model rather than an actual large-scale sandcastle.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle enclosed within a transparent spherical glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is clearly seen inside a glass dome, as the transparent spherical structure encapsulates the model, suggesting protection akin to a snow globe.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome placed on a sculpted base made of mahogany wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass dome in Image B appears richly colored, with a polished finish typical of mahogany wood. The design, color, and texture of the base align with characteristics of mahogany.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are fine, glittering grains visibly applied to the surface of the sandcastle to simulate a sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show signs of fine glittering grains on the sandcastle. Instead, the surface looks smooth and polished, not simulating a sandy texture. The model's surface appears consistent with a non-gritty material.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are tiny, ornately detailed seashells placed around the base of the sandcastle model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small seashells detailed around the base of the sandcastle model, adding decorative realism to the display. The presence of these suggests an ornamental purpose, complementing the miniature sandcastle.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire model and surrounding elements have a soft, matte pearl-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B exhibits a finish that appears smooth but does not resemble a pearl-like finish, which usually reflects a gently glistening and iridescent quality. The texture seems more like a polished miniature with a non-shiny surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
