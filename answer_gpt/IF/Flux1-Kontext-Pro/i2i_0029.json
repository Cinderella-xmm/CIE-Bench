      "question": "Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it visually appears that the stripes of the zebra extend onto the grass. This extension integrates with the grass in a way that mimics the zebraâ€™s natural black-and-white striped pattern, giving the illusion that the stripes are part of the grass itself.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the grassland rendered in a black-and-white striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass has a pattern that resembles the black-and-white stripes of a zebra. This pattern is characterized by evenly spaced, alternating light and dark areas, similar to the zebra's natural stripe pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a surrealistic effect by blending the zebra's stripes with the grassland, creating an imaginative and unconventional scene. This integration of the zebra's pattern into the surrounding environment is typical of a surrealistic style, where boundaries between objects and their surroundings become fluid and dream-like.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, there are no abrupt transitions or breaks where the stripes of the zebra meet the grass. The transition appears smooth and the stripes flow seamlessly into the grass pattern, which suggests careful editing to maintain continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the zebra's original body proportion been maintained despite the extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body proportions appear to be maintained correctly. Although the stripes have been extended into the grass, the actual body shape and size of the zebra remain consistent with a natural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
