      "question": "Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bears are covered with small square tiles that give the appearance of a mosaic.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sweaters of the teddy bears have been transformed into a mosaic tile pattern. The tiles are arranged in yellow and turquoise hues, giving a rich, intricate look that contrasts the original knitted texture of the sweaters seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the facial features of the teddy bears are reconstructed using tiles of varying shades. The eyes, nose, mouth, and snout are depicted with darker and lighter tiles providing depth and detail similar to facial features, though the arrangement creates a more stylized effect compared to the more plush-like features in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows tied around the teddy bears' necks maintain their glossy and smooth appearance, which stands out against the textured mosaic tile pattern on the bears. This contrast is evident, highlighting the bows as distinct elements with a smoother finish.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the mosaic teddy bears are sitting on a simple white pedestal. This pedestal provides a clean, minimalistic base that emphasizes the mosaic design of the bears by contrasting their colorful tile textures against the plain white background.",
