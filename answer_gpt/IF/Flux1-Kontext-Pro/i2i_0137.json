      "question": "Is the black vase replaced with a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable change in the object placed on the table between the two chairs. The object in Image A appears to be a black vase with floral elements inside, while Image B showcases a white teapot with a lid. The color and shape differences indicate the replacement from a vase to a teapot.",

      "question": "Are there two porcelain cups placed on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along with the teapot, there are two white porcelain cups visibly positioned on the floor-level in front of the chairs, presumably to mimic a tea-drinking setting. These cups are an addition not present in Image A, where the table only holds the vase in the center.",

      "question": "Does the arrangement of the teapot and cups imply a conversation scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a teapot and two cups typically suggests the setting for a tea session, which commonly involves social interaction or conversation. Such an arrangement implies two people could share a drink, thereby inferring a conversation scene. No such elements are present in Image A, contributing to an environment more centered around aesthetic presentation rather than interaction.",

      "question": "Have the original background and furniture positions remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the background including the window, curtains, side table, and plant remain consistent in position and appearance. The major change between Image A and B is the object on the table and additional cups. This indicates that while certain object placements have changed, the background and furniture positions have remained unchanged.",

      "question": "Do the teapot and porcelain cups match the lighting and environmental conditions in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is natural and soft, as shown by the daylight coming through the window onto the interiors, creating a homely and inviting atmosphere. The white teapot and porcelain cups appear consistent with this environment, typically appearing in such settings for their reflective surfaces under natural light. Their clear visibility and integration within the room suggest they match the room's conditions well.",
