      "question": "Does the edited image depict elements from extreme sports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual composition shows a person in a suit that appears to be in a dynamic, mid-air pose. The scene, however, does not include elements typical of extreme sports, such as skateboards, BMX bikes, or other sporting equipment and arenas. Instead, it appears more illustrative or surreal, with abstract elements surrounding the figure. Therefore, the image does not depict elements characteristic of extreme sports.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the person in the edited image shown in a jumping pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the person's legs is bent at the knees, and the arms are positioned as if maintaining balance or momentum, consistent with someone who is leaping or jumping. This dynamic pose suggests motion, indicative of a jumping action.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image feature bold outlines giving it a hand-drawn appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits characteristics of a hand-drawn illustration, particularly in the use of bold outlines around the figure and other elements. This style contributes to a graphic, artistic representation, differentiating itself from a typical photographic rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are abstract graffiti elements visible within the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the background of Image B reveals swirling, exaggerated forms that resemble abstract art or graffiti rather than realistic depictions. This abstract form could be interpreted as graffiti-like due to its freeform and artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background incorporate a concrete texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background primarily features abstract, artistic elements without a clear representation of realistic textures such as concrete. The texture appears more graphic and illustrative, lending itself more toward artistic representation than a depiction of concrete surfaces.",
