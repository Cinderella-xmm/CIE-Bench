      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the tagine in Image B retains its geometric patterns, similar to those found on traditional Moroccan tagines, rather than shifting to a script-like or mystical pattern.

        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Instead of resting on a cloud of smoke, Image B shows the tagine resting on a wooden surface without significant alteration at its base. The ethereal smoke is present around the tagine but does not replace its base, suggesting a magical ambiance rather than a physical transformation.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the image has been altered so that some ingredients transformed into glowing orbs, floating around the tagine.
