      "question": "Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sock is shown with a textured surface that resembles knitted fabric rather than LEGO bricks. The pattern on the sock is consistent with the design of a printed or woven material, not the discrete shapes and interlocking nubs characteristic of LEGO bricks. Therefore, the sock is not constructed from LEGO-style bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns visible on the sock in Image B appear as typical fabric designs and do not feature blocky shapes or textures characteristic of LEGO bricks. The patterns resemble knitted or woven designs rather than being composed of rectangular brick shapes. Thus, the patterns are not retained using LEGO brick shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sock with pattern details that are flat and uniformly textured like fabric. There is no indication of three-dimensional layering or variations in height that would suggest a LEGO brick construction with depth. Therefore, the sock does not exhibit three-dimensional construction with varying heights.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an orange tag at the top of the sock. It does not appear to be a LEGO brick piece. Instead, it resembles a standard fabric tag or label, which lacks the distinct brick characteristics, such as interlocking nubs or a rigid square shape. Therefore, the tag is not an orange LEGO brick piece.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the sock upright against a simple white background. This presentation is akin to a clean, minimalist environment, with no visible clutter or distracting elements surrounding it, resembling a gallery setting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sock's design does not show any architectural details such as aligned brick rows or defined edges typical of structural form seen in LEGO creations. The sock design is more fluid and appears as a typical textile with patterns embroidered or printed rather than structured like bricks.",
