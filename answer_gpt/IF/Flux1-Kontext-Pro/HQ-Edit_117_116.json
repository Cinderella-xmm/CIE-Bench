    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dragonfly visually transformed into a non-realistic, ethereal water spirit rather than a regular insect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly appears significantly artistic with exaggerated colors and reflection details. Despite these artistic enhancements, it retains its usual insect features, such as the body and wing shapes, without any mythical or ethereal transformations. The ambiance and enhanced colors create a surreal atmosphere but do not transform it into something non-insect-like.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings appear translucent with shimmering, waterfall-like patterns that suggest flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are depicted with a high level of detail, true to real dragonflies that possess translucent wings with intricate patterns. However, these wings do not show patterns suggestive of waterfalls or flowing water. They simply carry an exaggerated translucency and brightness, emphasizing their natural beauty.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dragonfly's body display iridescent, scale-like textures with visible swirling blue patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the dragonfly in Image B is characterized by a bright red color with enhanced details in comparison to a real dragonfly. However, it lacks iridescent, scale-like textures or swirling blue patterns. The colors are vibrant, enhancing the natural appearance rather than morphing into such specific mythical traits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing, plant-like vines visibly wrapped around the dragonfly’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly is perched on a stem or flower with no indication of plant-like vines around its legs. The legs appear clear without any such embellishments or glowing vine-like formations.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dragonfly’s eyes appear dark and deep, resembling the abyssal depths of the ocean with subtle inner glows or reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the dragonfly in Image B are detailed and, indeed, have a reflective quality, contributing to their realistic insect-like appearance. However, they do not convey the depth or glow indicative of oceanic abysses, but rather a natural, shiny appearance typical of dragonflies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a faint, misty halo or vapor effect surrounding the dragonfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B creates a bright, radiant atmosphere that significantly highlights the dragonfly and the surrounding flora. However, there is no distinct misty halo or vapor effect directly encircling the dragonfly, only an overall ambient light.",
