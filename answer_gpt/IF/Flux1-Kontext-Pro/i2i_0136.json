      "question": "Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be an orange with realistic textures and surface characteristics typical of a natural fruit rather than a crafted or manufactured item like a rubber keychain. The lighting and shadows on the orange suggest a natural occurrence rather than artificial plastic or rubber, as it showcases the typical skin texture of a citrus fruit. Therefore, based on the appearance in Image B, it remains a natural fruit.",

      "question": "Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the orange displayed possesses a visible stem at the top, which is characteristic of a freshly picked fruit rather than a modified or crafted object. The presence of the stem is consistent with how an authentic orange appears. Hence, if Image B is portraying a keychain, it retains the original stem.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the orange reflects light in a way that suggests a glossy appearance, typical of fresh and naturally juicy fruits. The shine is present and closely resembles how light would interact with a natural fruit surface as opposed to a matte finish often seen in synthetic products. This glossy look is maintained in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the keychain visually recognizable as a citrus fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B exhibits features such as the spherical shape, dimpled skin, vivid orange color, and a visible stem, all of which are strong identifiers of a citrus fruit like an orange. These elements together clearly project the image of a citrus fruit despite any context of being modified into a keychain. Therefore, it is visually recognizable as a citrus fruit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain include a visible attachment point like a ring or clip for keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an orange without any evident attachment point such as a ring or clip, which would typically be present if it were a functional keychain designed for keys. These components would usually be highly visible to facilitate easy connection to key rings. Given the absence of such elements in Image B, the depiction does not include a keychain attachment point.",
