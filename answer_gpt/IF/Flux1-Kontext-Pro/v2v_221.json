      "question": "Is the cow depicted in a stylized 3D chibi art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is shown with realistic proportions and textures, typical of a real cow, rather than exaggerated features or simplified forms that are characteristic of a 3D chibi art style. Chibi art typically involves oversized heads and exaggerated expressions, none of which are present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow exhibits natural black-and-white patterns across its body, similar to what is commonly seen on real cows. This indicates that the coat patterns have been retained as originally depicted.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cow's front hooves placed on top of the vintage television screen, suggesting the cow is leaning against it or supporting itself on it. This visual information combined with common knowledge about cow posture confirms this action.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the cow's facial expression appears neutral and typical of a cow, without any exaggerated or altered mouth shapes that would suggest a grin, mischievous or otherwise.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a natural setting including a grassy field and a bright sky with fluffy clouds. However, the clouds do not exhibit distinctive 3D modeling characteristics but are rather typical real-world clouds, thus suggesting a realistic scene rather than a modeled one.",
