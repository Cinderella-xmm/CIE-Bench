      "question": "Have the three sheep been converted into chibi characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are stylized as chibi characters, which is characterized by exaggerated cuteness, such as large heads and small bodies. This style distinctly transforms the original realistic animals into a more cartoonish and anthropomorphized version, which aligns with the chibi art style.",

      "question": "Do the chibi characters have scarves, earmuffs, and gloves added as winter accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi characters in Image B are illustrated with winter accessories: scarves around their necks, earmuffs as part of their hats, and gloves. These details are consistent with typical winter clothing and are added to enhance the chibi's winter theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the interaction pose of the chibi characters by the railing been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the characters standing side by side, but there is no railing or fence present. The arrangement of the chibi characters does not directly correlate with the positioning of the animals near a fence in Image A. Therefore, the original interaction pose by the railing is not maintained.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi characters in Image B are presented in a flat and cartoonish style with simple features and thick outlines, which are characteristics of many cartoon depictions, especially those aimed at looking cute and simplistic.",

      "question": "Is the background of the image transparent for sticker use?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is not transparent; instead, it features a solid gray color. A transparent background typically allows an object to be placed on different backgrounds without any visible border, whereas here the characters are set against a non-transparent background.",
