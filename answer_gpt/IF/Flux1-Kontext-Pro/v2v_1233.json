      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic pop-art comic design throughout the hospital setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hospital setting is characterized by its realistic representation. The room features medical equipment, hospital staff, and a patient in a hospital bed. A dynamic pop-art comic design typically includes exaggerated and graphic artistic elements, such as bold outlines, vibrant color combinations, and cartoonish expressions, none of which are present here. The image maintains a more traditional, realistic style seen in a hospital environment.",

      "question": "Are halftone patterns visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone patterns are a graphic design element commonly used in print media to create shades and gradients using dots of varying sizes. In the edited image, the hospital environment does not incorporate these halftone patterns, as it presents a clear and consistent display without any dot-based shading effects typical of halftone patterns.",

      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate striking, vivid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses realistic colors typically seen in a hospital setting, such as muted blue work outfits, white bedding, and standard medical equipment colors. There aren't any striking or vivid colors that enhance the visual impact in a way that would be expected in a pop-art or vibrant design theme.",

      "question": "Are there bold graphical details present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Bold graphical details would include features such as thick outlines, exaggerated forms, or highly stylized elements, none of which are present in the edited image. The image instead contains naturally-lit details aligning with a standard hospital scene, without adopting any bold or stylized visual elements.",

      "question": "Has the original scene composition been maintained in the edited image despite the style change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image, the layout and objects such as the medical equipment, hospital bed, and staff positioning appear consistent with what can be deduced from standard hospital room photographs, suggesting that the original composition is maintained. There is no evidence of drastic alteration or rearrangement of the scene.",
