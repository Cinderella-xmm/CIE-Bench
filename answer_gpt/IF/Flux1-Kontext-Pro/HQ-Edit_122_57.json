      "question": "Is the vase now composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics the original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is made of clear crystal with a reflective quality, indicating it is faceted and appears to mimic the original shape. This conclusion is based on the clarity and reflectiveness of the vase, which are typical features of crystalline materials. The transparent nature suggests it is indeed composed of crystal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative panels visible on the clear crystal vase are etched with abstract floral patterns. This is distinguished by the subtle, carved floral designs that replace the painted figures or scenes. The etched designs are less prominent than painted figures and are consistent with the medium of crystal which often features engraved or etched designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are pastel-colored, translucent, and appear to be intricately carved out of crystal. The translucent quality is evident from how light passes through the blossoms, and the pastel colors hint at a delicate, crystal glasswork rather than natural flowers. This indicates that the flowers are indeed composed of intricately carved crystal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is positioned on a flat, glossy surface that appears to reflect the base of the vase and partly the flowers, suggesting it is a mirrored pedestal. The minimalist design is indicated by the simple, unadorned appearance of the stand, contrasting with the ornate style of the vase itself.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the same overall shape, size, and structural features (such as handles and foot) as the original ornate vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the crystal vase retains a similar overall shape as the original but lacks certain structural features such as handles and the ornate foot that were present in Image A. The simplification typical of minimalist design influences suggests a change in structural details despite maintaining an overall similar shape.",
