      "question": "Are all structural elements of the Japanese house rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black lead lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to have the structural elements of the house depicted with black outlines around colored areas, mimicking the design style of stained glass where segments are bounded by black lead lines. This suggests that the Japanese house is rendered as colored glass panels bounded by black outlines, consistent with the stained glass artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized floral motifs made of red and green segmented glass pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are not shown as stylized floral motifs, but rather as stylized red trees that retain a similar shape to the original image. They are depicted using segmented colored areas, resembling the segmented nature of stained glass, but they are still trees, not floral motifs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the large red moon rendered using multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is depicted as a large singular round shape with a solid red color and does not show multiple overlapping or concentric gradient circles in shades of red. It maintains a simple design with a bold red color rather than a gradient effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all major elements (house, trees, moon) clearly outlined with thick, black, continuous lines resembling lead came in stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house, trees, and moon are outlined with thick black lines, reminiscent of the lead came technique used in traditional stained glass design. This technique involves creating outlines with thick lines, which is clearly used throughout the image to depict major elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene maintain the original composition (house centered, trees flanking, moon above, water in foreground) while all elements are styled as stained glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the original composition seen in Image A, where the house is centered, flanked by trees, with the moon positioned above and the water in the foreground. However, all these elements in Image B are restyled using stained glass techniques, such as bold black outlines and distinct colored segments, thus preserving the basic scene layout.",
