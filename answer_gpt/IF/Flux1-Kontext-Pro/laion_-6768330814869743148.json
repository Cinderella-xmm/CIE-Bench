      "question": "Are the pastries depicted with exaggerated, bright colors and bold outlines characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries are presented in bright, non-natural colors with thick, bold outlines. This style is reminiscent of pop art, which often uses exaggerated colors and bold lines to create a vivid, eye-catching appearance. The alteration gives the pastries an appearance far from their natural look, which aligns with pop art characteristics.",

      "question": "Do the bread slices feature bold outlines and vivid, non-naturalistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slices are depicted with strong outlines and colors that are not naturally found in actual bread, such as vibrant reds and blues. These are typical characteristics of stylized designs, where realistic colors are replaced with striking, artificial ones to create a unique visual effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the muffin liners replaced with distinct geometric patterns such as triangles, squares, or other regular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muffin liners remain consistent with their original shape but are rendered in a stylized pattern. However, they do not show explicit geometric patterns such as triangles or squares. Instead, their appearance is modified through color changes and style but retains an overall rounded shape.",

      "question": "Are the wooden trays replaced with a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe that the trays have been modified to include a checkerboard pattern at the lower section. This pattern consists of alternating colors, which is a distinct change from the solely wooden texture seen in the original Image A.",

      "question": "Have the background cups been replaced with abstract, colorful, non-representational shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cups in the background are largely unchanged in terms of shape but have taken on a stylized color treatment. They are depicted in simplified forms with a color change fitting the edited pop art aesthetic but remain representational and identifiable as cups.",
