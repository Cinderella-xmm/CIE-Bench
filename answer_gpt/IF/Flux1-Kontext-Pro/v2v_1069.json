      "question": "Is the ceiling fan enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure resembling a snow globe encasing the ceiling fan. The globe reflects light and has a spherical shape typical of a snow globe, indicating that the fan is inside a transparent enclosure. This analysis is based on the visible characteristics such as shape and transparency in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest atop a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the snow globe is placed on a flat surface, suggestive of a tabletop. The lighting appears warm and soft, casting a gentle glow on the snow globe and surrounding area. The background is plain and lacks distractions, indicating a minimalist setup. These observations derive from the snow globe base's interaction with the surface and the subtle light gradient.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, tiny sparkles and light reflections are visible around the globe, indicative of delicate shimmering effects. These effects appear to be concentrated on and around the snow globe itself, suggesting that they result from light refracting through the globe's surfaces. Visual knowledge of how transparent spheres impact light leads to this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fan inside the snow globe depicted in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the fan with realistic detailing and metallic finishes similar to traditional design, rather than playful or exaggerated features associated with cartoon style. The realistic rendering of materials and the adherence to authentic proportions suggests a standard 3D design, not a cartoon style.",

      "question": "Are snowflakes visible drifting gently through the air inside the tiny room within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small sparkles and floating lights enclosed within the snow globe, reminiscent of typical snow globe designs that often feature snowflake-like elements. However, these sparkles can represent ambient light effects rather than snowflakes specifically floating through the air inside a room. Thus, true snowflakes are not distinctly visible drifting in Image B.",
