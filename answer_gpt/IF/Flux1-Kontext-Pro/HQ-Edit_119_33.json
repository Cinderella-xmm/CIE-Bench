        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflower field is represented with bold, stylized features including curling lines and ornate patterns. This artistic choice substitutes realism for decorative, soft curves and complex designs, creating a field that resembles a tapestry or an ornamental artwork rather than a realistic depiction, which is consistent with Art Nouveau aesthetics.",
