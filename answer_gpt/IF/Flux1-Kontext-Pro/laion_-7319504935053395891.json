      "question": "Is the chocolate tower redesigned into a box-shaped structure resembling a festive tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate structure is shaped like a conical or triangular tree with a star on top, which is commonly associated with a festive tree or Christmas tree. However, it is not box-shaped, as a box shape implies a more rectangular or square form. Thus, the structure does resemble a festive tree in its conical form, but not a box shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible cutout windows in the structure that reveal chocolate layers inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure has multiple teardrop-shaped cutouts on its surface, which allow the inside contents, likely chocolates or similar items, to be visible through these openings. This matches the description of 'cutout windows.'",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is gold foiling visibly applied to the surface of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the presence of shiny, golden elements visible through the cutouts and on the exterior surface, which can be considered as gold foiling. These elements add a decorative and elegant effect to the packaging.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are intricate nut embellishments present on the surface of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show intricate nut embellishments on the exterior surface of the packaging; instead, it shows nuts visible through the cutouts, hinting at the presence of nuts as contents rather than as embellishments on the packaging surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's surface appears smooth with a shiny finish likely due to the chocolate and potential gold foiling. This does not constitute a 'sparkle effect,' which is typically more granular and reflective across the surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are golden motifs and patterns on the surface of the chocolate structure, including symbols that suggest holiday or festive themes, executed in contrast with the darker brown hue of the chocolate. These motifs are likely meant to be seasonal and elegant.",
