      "question": "Has the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a bottle-shaped object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a clear bottle-like shape which is distinct from the Eiffel Tower's architectural form, confirming that the Eiffel Tower has been replaced with a bottle-shaped object. This conclusion is drawn from the visual features such as the rounded and squared edges typically seen in bottles, which differ from the intricate lattice framework and structural complexity characteristic of the Eiffel Tower.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the structure have a transparent or glass-like appearance with embossed lattice patterns resembling the Eiffel Tower's framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bottle with a clear, glass-like appearance. The bottle features embossed patterns that suggest the Eiffel Tower's framework through visually identifiable motifs like the lattice and shape, albeit in an engraved or relief format on the surface of the bottle.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a gold-colored, metallic-looking base supporting the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a gold-colored base supporting the bottle. Instead, the gold color is observed in the metallic-looking nozzle at the top of the bottle rather than the base. Typically, a base would be at the bottom, whereas here the visual cue of gold color is associated with the spray mechanism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a faint depiction of a Parisian skyline visible on the surface of the glass bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B shows faint engravings on its surface, which include recognizable elements of a skyline complemented by the Eiffel Tower motif. This suggests a depiction of the Parisian skyline subtly integrated into the bottle's design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a small, simple, and modern logo located at the neck of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible logo at the neck of the bottle. The neck area is occupied by the spray nozzle, which is metallic and gold-colored without any branding or logo depicted.",
