      "question": "Is the sheep and clock scene enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock are visibly contained within a transparent snow globe. The spherical glass surface surrounds the subjects, indicating the nature of a snow globe. Commonly, snow globes feature clear domes that encapsulate scenes or objects, allowing visibility while providing a protective barrier. The snow globe is consistent with typical visual characteristics: being clear and spherical with contents visible through the glass.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest on a wooden tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is situated on a flat surface with a wood grain texture and coloration resembling that of typical wooden furniture. The surface appears to be consistent with a table composed of wood, a common material used for table construction. This observation, combined with common knowledge of furniture design, supports the idea that the snow globe rests on a wooden tabletop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scene illuminated by gentle, ambient lighting, casting warm glows on the table and nearby areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's lighting appears soft and diffused, with warm tones and gentle shadows, reflecting typical ambient lighting scenarios that offer a cozy, inviting atmosphere. Such lighting usually results in warmer color reflections on surfaces like wood, consistent with the observed warm glow on the tabletop. The lighting enhances the visual warmth of Image B's setting.",

      "question": "Are the sheep and clock depicted as adorable chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock have features aligning with chibi-style art, characterized by exaggerated proportions and a cute appearance. The sheep's oversized head and distinctively simplistic design reflect chibi traits, often seen in 3D models meant to evoke cuteness. The clock may also exhibit such design intentions, fitting into the same art style by emphasizing simplicity and charm.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sheep casually leaning against the clock inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep stands adjacent to the clock with no visible posture or positioning that suggests leaning. The animals' stance appears upright, facing the viewer with space between it and the clock. Leaning typically involves direct contact or inclination towards an object, which is not evident here.",

      "question": "Are there gently drifting snowflakes surrounding the sheep inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts several white particles floating around the sheep inside the snow globe, reminiscent of snowflakes. These particles are consistent with the appearance and behavior of snowflakes in a snow globe, appearing suspended or moving slowly due to gravity's effect within the enclosed space. This aligns with the common design of snow globes, where snowflakes are meant to hover or drift around the encapsulated scene.",
