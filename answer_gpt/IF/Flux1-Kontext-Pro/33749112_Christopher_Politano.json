    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mountains visibly reimagined as a stone-carved body with moss forming distinct fur-like patterns across their surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual transformation shows the mountains designed as a humanoid or mythical creature, where the texture and arrangement suggest a deliberate stone-carved form. Moss or grass on the mountains is styled to mimic fur, which aligns with the description. This artistic reinterpretation distinguishes Image B from a regular mountain scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lake appear as a reflective surface mirroring the sky, with visible mystical symbols embedded within its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake appears to have an ethereal quality with elements that resemble symbols or patterns that are not part of typical natural reflections. These symbols give an impression of mysticism, contrasting significantly from a simple reflective surface. This effect is achieved through light manipulation and graphical elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are twisted rock horns visibly present atop the mountain peaks, distinct from the original rock formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes the addition of twisted rock formations rising from the peak that resemble horns. These features do not appear naturally in typical mountain landscapes and are a creative modification to the landscape envisioned in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the original pathways appear as glowing, luminescent lines running across the terrain, resembling veins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pathways initially seen in Image A have been altered to appear as glowing lines. This effect makes them look like luminescent veins running through the landscape, creating a contrast to the non-glowing, natural paths found in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grassy slopes replaced with textured, shimmering scales that exhibit a celestial or iridescent hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the slopes maintain a more traditional grass-like appearance rather than appearing as shimmering scales with an iridescent or celestial hue. The texture seems consistent with grass rather than the suggested scales.",
