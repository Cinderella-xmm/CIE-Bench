      "question": "Is the entire image, including the cosmic vortex and forest landscape, rendered in the style of a stained glass window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) appears to be in the style of a stained glass window. This conclusion is drawn from the angular, segmented appearance of elements, and the use of black outlines that are characteristic of stained glass. The swirling vortex, trees, and landscape feature patterns reminiscent of stained glass artwork, suggesting that the entire image adopts this style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spiral patterns of the cosmic vortex outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines resembling lead cames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral patterns are distinctly outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines, similar to the lead cames used in stained glass windows to separate different pieces of glass. This observation is based on the visible structure of the image, matching the traditional stained glass technique.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sky and tree canopies depicted using deep, saturated colors such as deep blues, purples, reds, and greens characteristic of jewel tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features deep, saturated colors throughout the sky and tree canopies, presenting a rich palette of jewel tones. These colors are typically vibrant and give the impression of illuminated stained glass, reinforcing the stained glass style of the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the stained glass elements (including the spiral and trees) exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures that simulate light refraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of the elements in Image B, such as the cosmic vortex and the trees, display angular, multi-faceted textures. This texture suggests a simulation of light refraction, as seen in stained glass artworks where light interacts with differently angled glass surfaces, creating a dynamic visual effect.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature soft, glowing light effects, smooth color transitions, and balanced composition that evoke a sense of calm and serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the edited image (Image B) presents a harmonious composition with vibrant colors, it lacks the soft, glowing light effects and smooth color transitions typical of a more serene and tranquil atmosphere. The use of bold outlines and segmented textures contrasts with the characteristic soft glow of natural light, indicative of stained glass which generally does not emphasize smooth gradients.",
