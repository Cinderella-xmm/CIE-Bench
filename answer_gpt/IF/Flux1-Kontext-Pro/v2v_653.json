      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features a chibi-style illustration of a scientist with exaggerated characteristics typical of such art styles—particularly oversized eyes and soft, rounded facial features. These are common visual traits used to invoke a sense of cuteness and approachability.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a series of chibi illustrations where the character is consistently wearing a white lab coat paired with a light blue shirt in each pose. This consistent outfit design helps communicate that the character is a scientist, reinforcing their professional role across different activities depicted in the stickers.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is bright green and features a subtle hexagonal pattern, which suggests a scientific or chemical theme. Each sticker is surrounded by white borders, providing separation and making each piece stand out as an individual item.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the chibi scientist designs depicts the figure holding a beaker containing a colorful, bubbling liquid. The expression on the character’s face is visibly curious, aligning with the posed theme of scientific exploration and experimentation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the six sticker designs do not adhere to a 9:16 aspect ratio. Instead, these illustrations are more squared or slightly rectangular and varied in shape. This stylistic choice allows more emphasis on the character and actions depicted within each sticker rather than conforming to a wide aspect ratio.",
