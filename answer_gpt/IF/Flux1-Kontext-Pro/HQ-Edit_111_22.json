      "question": "Is the woman rendered in a cartoon style with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman has stylized features typical of traditional illustrations with outlined details and color fills, and the proportions are not exaggerated but more in line with classical art styles. This suggests a cartoon-like approach with less realism and more stylization. Simplification or exaggeration is an expected feature of cartoon styles. However, the details and attire still carry a traditional feel rather than a modern cartoon style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the knitting needles visibly longer than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the knitting needles appear to be of a realistic length, matching standard knitting needles. They seem proportionately accurate to a typical scale for knitting rather than appearing longer in Image B compared to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the yarn being used in knitting feature vibrant, non-realistic patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yarn depicted appears to have multi-color patterns, which is consistent with artistic approaches where vibrancy is emphasized to portray texture or design. The representation may be slightly more exaggerated due to the cartoon style but still within the bounds of possible realistic yarn color variations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are delicate lace patterns visible on the woman’s robe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s robe has detailed patterns, but they appear more woven or knitted rather than delicate lace. The realistic style emphasizes texture but doesn’t specifically depict lace patterns, which would be characterized by fine, intricate openings and lacework imagery.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Does the overall image have a warm sepia tone with golden-brown and orange hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly has a warm sepia tone, incorporating golden-brown and orange hues. This is evidenced by the overall color palette and background, giving a vintage look and feel, typical of illustrations intending to evoke a nostalgic or warm atmosphere.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Is there a wooden texture border surrounding the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a classic border can be seen that mimics traditional card designs but does not explicitly display a wooden texture. The visuals do not show a texture that is distinctly wooden; rather, it uses ornate borders often found in vintage illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the bottom right corner of Image B, there is a clear blank area with ornamental lines suggesting a space intended for writing personal messages or notes, common in postcard or stationary designs.",
