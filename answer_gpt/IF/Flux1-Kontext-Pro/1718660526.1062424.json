      "question": "Is the animal composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles arranged to form its body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal's body appears to be made up of numerous small, square-shaped tiles. These tiles are arranged closely together, typical of mosaic art, giving the object a tiled appearance. This visual cue, combined with knowledge of mosaic art, supports the conclusion that the animal is indeed composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles arranged to form its body.",

      "question": "Are the stripes made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal displays stripes that appear glossy with vivid colors. The orange and black hues are bright and distinct, indicative of glazed ceramic tiles which are often shiny. This observation aligns with the appearance of ceramic tile techniques, where vibrant and contrasting colors are used. Therefore, the stripes look like they are made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black.",

      "question": "Are the eyes and snout formed from precisely cut ceramic tiles that maintain their expressive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes and snout in Image B are formed using tiles that, despite their small, uniform size, are strategically placed to maintain an expressive appearance. The tiles are arranged around the eye and snout areas to give depth and character, which is common in fine mosaic arrangements where careful placement enhances expressiveness.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mosaic animal positioned on a surface with a visible sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface on which the animal is positioned shows a granular, uneven texture that is characteristic of sand. This appearance aligns with the common understanding of sandy terrains, which have small particles and an irregular surface. Thus, the animal appears to be on a surface with a visible sandy texture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the smooth, glossy surface of the tiles and the rough, granular texture of the platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual contrast in Image B is striking; the animal's body is composed of shiny, smooth tiles, while the surface beneath it is rough and uneven, like sand. This creates a clear textural difference that is visually perceivable, highlighting the contrast between the glossiness of the tiles and the graininess of the platform.",
