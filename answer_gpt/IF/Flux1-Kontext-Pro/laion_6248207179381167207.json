      "question": "Are the patterned surfaces of the handbag replaced with sleek geometric silver and turquoise motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag's surface features a shiny turquoise color combined with silver Louis Vuitton monogram patterns. This gives it a sleek and modern appearance. Geometric motifs typically involve shapes such as lines, angles, and patterns that are visually balanced or symmetrical, which are present here with the consistent, repeated logos and floral emblems. Therefore, the analysis indicates that the surface is indeed sleek with silver and turquoise motifs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather straps appear to have the same brown leather appearance without the addition of any metallic accents or reflective finishes such as silver trim.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the handbag do not display any obvious intricate machine-age engravings. The primary change appears to be in the color and pattern of the main surface of the bag. Detailed engravings would be visible as fine etchings or decorations, subtly integrated along the edges, which are not present here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Art Deco style is characterized by bold geometric patterns, symmetry, and the use of metallic finishes. Image B displays a turquoise and silver design that highlights geometric symmetry in the pattern repetition and a metallic sheen, aligning with the elegance often associated with Art Deco. Therefore, based on the visual design elements present, the bag exhibits characteristics of Art Deco style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the handbag's structural form and proportions, such as the shape, size, and layout of compartments, have remained consistent. Only the surface style has changed, with the new color and pattern made over the existing form. This indicates that the structural form and proportions have indeed been preserved.",
