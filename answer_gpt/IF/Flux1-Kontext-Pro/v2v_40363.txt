    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire image composed of small, distinct mosaic tiles with visible grout lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a wall with brick patterns, not a mosaic style. Mosaic tiles have distinct small pieces with visible grout lines, which are not present here.

    "Question": "Q3: Are the outlines of the heart balloon and the child clearly defined and emphasized in the mosaic style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the heart and the child are clearly defined with sharp edges as expected in a painted mural. However, they do not follow the mosaic style, which would typically involve broken, less precise lines due to the tile shapes. The edges are drawn with precision typical of a painted mural.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the material of the artwork reflect the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles, such as a glossy or matte finish?",
    "explanation": "The artwork in Image B does not reflect characteristics typical of ceramic mosaic tiles. Instead, it shows a painted surface on a brick wall. Mosaic tiles have a characteristic texture and reflective quality, which is absent here; the image instead resembles a typical paint finish on an outdoor mural.",
