        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft is presented within a glass display case, showing characteristics consistent with a 3D model rather than a photorealistic representation. The details and finish of the model, enclosed within the case, give a sense of miniaturization typical in model displays.",
