      "question": "Does the cocktail glass appear to be sculpted from clay with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass has a distinctive texture that resembles clay, typically characterized by a slightly rough surface. The glass's contours and edges appear to have been handcrafted, lacking the smoothness of glass or plastic, which is a common attribute when objects are sculpted from clay. This gives it a rustic and textured feel, supporting the idea that it is indeed made to look like it's sculpted from clay.",

      "question": "Are the ice cubes and lime slice depicted with intricate clay textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, both the ice cubes and the lime slice have a consistent clay-like texture with the rest of the scene. The ice cubes appear to be solid and opaque, lacking the transparency and reflection typical of real ice. Similarly, the lime slice has the same matte appearance and texture. This suggests the intention to depict them as sculpted from clay.",

      "question": "Do the surroundings, including the bar and bottles, exhibit a handcrafted clay appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as the bar counter and the bottles appear to be made of the same material as the cocktail glass, with a uniform clay-like texture. These surroundings have a matte finish and soft details that are more typical of handcrafted clay objects than real-life objects, which are often more detailed and have varying textures and materials.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition maintain an organic, imperfect look characteristic of hand-sculpted clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire composition in Image B reflects the organic, imperfect properties of hand-sculpted clay. There are subtle imperfections and textural variations that suggest it was hand-crafted. This includes irregularities in the shape and surface texture of the glass, ice, lime slice, and background, which are all indicative of manual clay work rather than industrial manufacturing processes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting and shading adjusted to enhance the clay-like textures and three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses lighting and shading to accentuate the clay-like textures, providing a sense of depth and a three-dimensional effect. The shadows and highlights are soft and diffuse, helping to emphasize the surface detail and texture of the clay, making it appear tactile and realistic. This careful use of lighting enhances the perception of the objects being sculpted from clay.",
