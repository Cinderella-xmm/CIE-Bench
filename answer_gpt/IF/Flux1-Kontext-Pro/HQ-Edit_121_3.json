    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the butterfly been transformed into a creature that visually resembles a floral being, with no recognizable insectoid body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly resembles a floral being as its wings and body have been incorporated into the flower design, with vibrant petals that resemble leaves. The original insectoid body parts, such as the segmented torso and conventional wings, are not clearly visible. The transformation includes merging the butterfly's wings into floral petals and its body into a flower stalk.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings appear folded into distinct, vibrant petal-like structures instead of flat, membranous insect wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are transformed into petal-like structures. The vibrant colors and layered arrangement create a visual that resembles flower petals rather than the flat, membranous structure typically seen in insect wings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the butterfly's body now resemble a thin, upright flower stalk rather than an insectâ€™s segmented torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of what was originally the butterfly in Image A appears more akin to a flower stalk rather than showing features of an insect's segmented torso. This is evident from the thin, elongated structure extending into the plant below, creating an organic flow from the petals above.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original wing patterns replaced with detailed, naturalistic leaf designs across the entire surface of the wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the wing patterns from the butterfly; however, they are overlaid with petal-like designs, not leaf designs. The patterns integrate with the petal transformation but do not exclusively feature naturalistic leaf designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible tendril-like structures extending from the tips of the butterfly's antennae?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the antennae, tendril-like structures are indeed visible extending from the tips. These extensions contribute to the floral aesthetic and suggest an adaptation from insect to plant features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small blossoms visibly attached to the edges of the wings and at the foot/lowest part of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no small blossoms attached to the edges of the wings or at the lowest part of the creature. The transformation primarily revolves around the petal-like wings and flower stalk body without additional blossoms protruding from these areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background identical to the original image, featuring the same meadow with pink coneflowers, golden grasses, and blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the background features are largely similar. The meadow setting, with pink coneflowers, golden grasses, and a blue sky, remains consistent from Image A to Image B, reflecting a continuous pastoral backdrop without significant alteration.",
