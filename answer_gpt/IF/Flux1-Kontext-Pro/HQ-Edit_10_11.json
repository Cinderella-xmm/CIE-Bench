        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla displays characteristics typical of a wood carving: it has a uniform wooden texture and a more rigid, solid appearance compared to the natural and flexible look of furred animals. The color and texture are consistent with wood properties, indicating it's a sculpture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire sculpture, including the arms and legs, possesses a uniform smooth texture that is consistent with the appearance of a carved wooden piece, lacking in fine anatomical details typically present in detailed sculptures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not display the lush greenery and depth of a forest. Instead, it consists of a flat, carved wooden surface, which gives the appearance of being etched into wood.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
