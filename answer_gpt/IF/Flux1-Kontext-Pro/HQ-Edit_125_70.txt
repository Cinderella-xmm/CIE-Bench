    "Question": "Q1: Is there a visible logo placed on the handle of the hammer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a logo visible on the handle of the hammer.

    "Question": "Q2: Are there elegant, readable typographic elements displayed directly on the wood shavings scattered across the workbench?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, an inspection of the wood shavings scattered across the workbench does not show any typographic elements.
