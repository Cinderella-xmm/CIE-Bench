      "question": "Is there a magnifying glass placed in the position of one book on a shelf, casting a noticeable shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a magnifying glass is visible on the desk at the bottom center of the image, but it is not placed on a shelf. The magnifying glass's presence on the desk serves as a key focal point beneath the large book opened on the desk, indicating its purpose for inspection or investigation. The image does not show a magnifying glass placed directly on any shelf, hence there's no shadow cast from it in that location.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a faint, translucent outline of a detective wearing a trench coat visible on the window curtain pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a distinct shadow that appears like the silhouette of a person wearing a hat and trench coat. It is prominent directly in front of the curtain pattern, simulating a detective's typical attire, and is silhouetted clearly against the patterned curtain as if cast by lighting from behind. This suggests the presence of a character often associated with mystery or detective themes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the overall color tone of the image been shifted to deep sepia, giving it a moody and aged appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette indeed takes on a deep sepia tone, characteristic of aged photographs or artworks, enhancing the atmosphere of antiquity and mystery. Sepia tones are achieved by shifting the colors towards warm browns and muted yellows, which add a vintage feel fitting the theme of mystery or legacy suggested by the setup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Lost Legacy\" displayed in a bold, serif font across the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title \"The Lost Legacy\" is prominently displayed across the top in a bold serif typeface. This choice of font, with its classic lines and strong presence, suggests sophistication and gravitas, aligning well with the themes of mystery and legacy presented in the visual context of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original intricate details such as the ornate ceiling, book spines, and desk carvings still clearly visible and preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B portrays the general setup in a mysterious and moody manner, detailed elements such as the ceiling and desk carvings have been effectively obscured by shadow and the focus on the central figure and thematic elements. The camera angle and lighting prioritize the items on the desk and the shadowed silhouette, thus intricate architectural and furnishing details present in Image A are not distinctly visible, emphasizing the thematic shift.",
