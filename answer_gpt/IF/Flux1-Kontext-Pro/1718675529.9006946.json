    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image rendered in a stylized, graphic manner consistent with Art Deco design principles, rather than a photorealistic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits characteristics typical of Art Deco design, such as stylized, geometric forms that eschew realistic representation. Observing Image B, the flat, bold shapes and defined lines suggest a deliberate move away from the realistic style seen in Image A, which employs natural textures and lighting effects. Art Deco often features streamlined forms and symmetry, both present here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ocean waves represented using bold, simplified geometric curves instead of naturalistic wave forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows ocean waves characterized by bold, simplified curves that contrast sharply with the more complex and textured wave forms in Image A. The geometric representation in Image B aligns with the simplification and stylization typical of Art Deco, which aims for clarity and boldness in design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted as stylized vertical lines without detailed fronds or natural tree structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The representation of palm trees in Image B focuses on vertical lines and minimal detail, emphasizing form over natural complexity. This contrasts sharply with Image A, where trees exhibit detailed fronds and a natural appearance. Image B's approach aligns with Art Deco's preference for stylization and abstraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky rendered as symmetrical, geometric shapes rather than natural cloud forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, clouds are depicted as symmetrical and geometric, deviating from the natural variety observed in Image A. This stylization aligns with geometric symmetry characteristic of Art Deco, favoring structured and idealized forms over chaotic natural shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use a color palette dominated by muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, avoiding bright or highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B consists of muted tones of green, blue, and warm oranges, reflecting a calm and sophisticated aesthetic typical of Art Deco, rather than vivid or high saturation colors. Image A uses a more natural and dynamic range of colors, emphasizing realism and detail rather than stylized elegance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the essential elements of the beach scene—sand, ocean, horizon, and sky—still present and recognizable despite the stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylized depiction in Image B, the scene's essential elements—sand, ocean, horizon, and sky—remain clearly recognizable. They maintain their identity through simplified forms and colors, differing from the realistic representation in Image A but nonetheless identifiable as part of a beach scene.",
