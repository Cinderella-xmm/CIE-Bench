      "question": "Has the surfboard been replaced with a giant manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object beneath the surfer has been replaced. Observing its shape, texture, and features, it resembles a large aquatic creature with fins, commonly recognized as a shark. It is not a manta ray, which typically has a flat body and broad wings. Therefore, the object is not a manta ray but rather a different marine animal.",

      "question": "Are the surfers' original poses maintained on the manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer's pose and positioning appear consistent with typical surfing stances, as seen in Image A, where the surfer stands with a balanced posture. The original pose from Image A is maintained, though the surfer now stands atop a creature instead of a surfboard, but still in a standing, balanced position.",

      "question": "Does the image include dreamy atmosphere elements like soft lighting or misty effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a clear, sharp ocean scene with distinct colors and defined details, similar to Image A. There are no obvious soft lighting or misty effects suggesting a dreamy atmosphere. The scene is well-lit with bright, natural light reflecting off the water.",

      "question": "Is the manta ray depicted as a giant creature beneath the surfer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature beneath the surfer is depicted as a large animal, but its characteristics align more with a shark, given the visible fin and body shape. This analysis indicates that the creature is not a manta ray, which has a distinct body structure.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the surfer and the manta ray still clearly visible and identifiable despite the dreamy atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the surfer and the marine creature (shark) in Image B remain clear and identifiable due to the sharp, well-defined focus and natural lighting of the photograph. Despite the creature being mistaken for a manta ray, the objects are clearly visible, but the image does not possess a dreamy effect to obscure them.",
