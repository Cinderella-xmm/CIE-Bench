    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a squirrel present in the foreground of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct creature in the foreground with features such as a fluffy tail and small ears, accurately representing a squirrel. This determination is made based on the visual characteristics typical of squirrels, such as their posture and fur texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel blend naturally with the painting's brushstrokes and color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the squirrel's fur rendered in a style that mirrors the swirling brushstrokes of the painting, using colors that harmonize with the overall blue and yellow tones. This consistency in style and palette suggests an integration attempt with the art style of the painting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the squirrel positioned in the foreground, closer to the viewer than other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel is depicted with a size and detail level suggesting proximity to the viewer. It is positioned at the lowest plane of the painting, which is often used to imply foreground placement in landscape compositions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the addition of the squirrel maintain the overall harmony and composition of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the perspective and coloring of Image B, the squirrel appears to be integrated onto an area that does not clash with the dominant elements of the painting, like the towering cypress or swirling sky. Its inclusion respects the composition's balance by not disrupting the major visual flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the squirrel sized appropriately in relation to other elements in the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is proportioned so that it seems to belong to the foreground without overwhelming other features like the cypress tree and buildings. It is large enough to be noticeable but small enough not to dominate the scene, aligning with expected foreground scaling.",
