      "question": "Are all the original woodworking tools replaced with intricately detailed enamel replicas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools, including the hammer, have undergone changes that give them an appearance of smoothness and a more polished look compared to Image A. The handles and surfaces are glossy, suggesting a transformation from potentially wood and metal to an enamel-like finish. The enamel effect is indicated by their smooth, polished surfaces that differ from the worn, rustic, and textured look of the tools in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the hammer handle rendered in deep blue enamel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer handle is colored in a glossy deep blue hue which resembles the enamel coating. Enamel typically gives objects a glossy and vibrant finish. In comparison, Image A shows a hammer with a wooden handle which has a natural, rustic appearance. The transformation to deep blue suggests an enamel-like treatment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hammer heads have a glossy metallic finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer head appears to have a shiny, smooth metallic finish, which is common for enamel treatments or polished metals. This differs from Image A where the hammer head has a more matte, worn, and rustic appearance. The enhanced gloss suggests a surface treatment that increases reflectiveness, characteristic of polished or enamel surfaces.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the wood shavings been replaced with delicate enamel curls in shades of amber and ivory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curls present on the surface resemble delicate ornamental pieces that often feature in enamel artworks, with visually smooth and curved shapes and colors like amber and ivory. They differ from the more irregular and rough wood shavings seen in Image A. The shapes and the smoother texture in Image B suggest they are crafted rather than naturally occurring wood shavings, likely intended to appear as enamel art.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tools positioned on a textured linen fabric surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background on which the tools are placed appears to be a textured linen fabric, characterized by a soft, woven appearance with slight texture visible in the photograph. This contrasts with Image A, where the tools are placed on a rough wooden surface. The switch in materials is visually identifiable through the fabric's texture and composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric surface visually complement the polished appearance of the enamel tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The linen fabric in Image B provides a contrasting yet complementary background to the enamel tools due to its soft and natural texture, which accentuates the glossy and vibrant appearance of the tools. The balance between the textured linen and smooth, polished tools creates an aesthetic contrast, effectively highlighting the tools' vibrant colors and finishes. This visual dynamic helps emphasize the refined craftsmanship of the enamel tools.",
