      "question": "Has the vase and bouquet been transformed into a 3D printed display model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question is a 3D printed model of a bulldog on a skateboard, similar to the dog in the original setting. However, there was no vase and bouquet in Image A. The comparison is between the dog standing on a skateboard in both images, hence no transformation from a vase and bouquet to a display model is evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D printed model appear to be made of matte material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bulldog model has a non-reflective, smooth surface, commonly associated with matte finishes. This is discernable from the way light interacts with the surface, showing minimal glare or shiny reflections, indicative of a matte material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a display plaque added at the base of the 3D printed model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a base under the 3D printed model that includes a plaque with text on it, suggesting it is used for display purposes. The presence of the plaque is evident due to the visible text in front of the base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Has the background been set as a tech expo booth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a background typical of a tech fair or expo, characterized by people walking around, displays, banners, and lighting one would associate with such environments. This differs from the park background in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the 3D printed model maintain the design of the original vase and bouquet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image A and Image B both feature a bulldog on a skateboard rather than a vase and bouquet, the question appears to be based on incorrect premise. The design maintains similarity in the form of the bulldog and skateboard from both Image A and Image B.",
