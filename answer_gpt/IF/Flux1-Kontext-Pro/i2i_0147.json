      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dogs have a noticeable layer of light yellow, gooey substance that appears to be draped over them in ribbons. Based on its color and texture, this is characteristic of melted cheese. Common sense tells us that cheese often melts into this consistency when heated, particularly when placed on hot foods such as hot dogs on a grill.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible elements on the hot dogs are the strips of melted cheese and small red dots that may resemble bits of sauce or seasoning. Fried onions typically appear in golden brown and have a crispy texture, which isn't visible on the hot dogs in this image.",

      "question": "Is there a barbecue tong added near the grill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a metallic object with a spoon-like end positioned near the right side of the grill. This object is more consistent with a sauce spoon or a utensil for basting, rather than tongs, which typically have two prongs for gripping.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the hot dog buns and sausages are clearly visible and maintain their shape, making them easily identifiable. The sausage is housed within the bun, a typical arrangement, and is complemented by added toppings (melted cheese), but these elements do not obscure their distinct shapes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dogs rest on a black grill, and beneath it, there is a visible orange glow implying active flames or coals. Both the grill and the fire are evident, contributing to a typical scene where food is being grilled over an open flame.",
