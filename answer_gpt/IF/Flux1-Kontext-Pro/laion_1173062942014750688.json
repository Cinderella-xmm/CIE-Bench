    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads are arranged in a more organized pattern compared to Image A, resembling more of a serpentine form. However, they are still visually identifiable as separate beads strung together rather than formed into one cohesive creature's body, indicating that they are not presented as a singular serpent-shaped creature.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red and yellow colors on the beads feature repetitive circular and linear designs that one might associate with a scaly texture common in serpent imagery. While the beads do suggest a pattern reminiscent of scales, it is not distinctly crafted into a scaly texture; the designs are simplified decorative elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the serpent have two blue circular features positioned as eyes at its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows beads with blue circular patterns on each strand, but there is no discernible head or eye placement that would identify them as eyes, such as at the front end of a serpentine shape. The placement of blue circles is consistent across the beads without focal differentiation for eyes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black motifs arranged as detailed, tribal-style patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black motifs on the beads appear as simple lines and dots integrated within the colored patterns. Although they are repetitive, they are not sufficiently intricate or continuous enough to classify them as detailed tribal-style patterns. Instead, they serve as minimal decorative elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s tail extend into a long, thin, flowing form with small, dangling bead-like tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the strands of beads end with short strings that have small, bead-like tips, which could be interpreted as a tail with dangling elements but do not explicitly portray flowing or elongated forms typical of a serpentine tail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are only the original colors (red, yellow, blue, black) used in the serpent, with no additional or unrelated colors introduced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads prominently feature red, yellow, blue, and black colors, matching those seen in Image A. There is no indication of new colors introduced into the pattern, reaffirming adherence to the original color scheme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
