    "Question": "Q1: Are the sausages, salad, and egg completely replaced by glass tiles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show distinct tile shapes forming the sausages, salad, and egg areas. Each food item appears as a mosaic made up of several small glass tiles, rather than actual food items, suggesting a complete replacement by glass tiles. This design is common in artistic representations where the mosaic technique is used to create images using colored glass or ceramic tiles.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the tiles used for the sausages visibly larger than those used for the lettuce?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages are represented using fewer and larger tile pieces compared to the lettuce area, which features smaller and more numerous tiles. This visual distinction suggests the tiles for the sausages are indeed larger than those used for the lettuce, consistent with the size difference between the real objects these tiles represent.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the mosaic composition arranged symmetrically on a plain ceramic background?",
    "explanation": "While Image B has a well-organized layout with clearly defined sections for each food item, the mosaic doesn't appear perfectly symmetrical nor is it arranged on a plain ceramic background. Rather, the mosaic sections display varied shapes and sizes that contribute to visual interest, but do not exhibit strict symmetry, and the background itself is composed of many tiles rather than a plain surface.",
    "answer": "No"
