      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the core visual elements of Image A in the form of a glow-in-the-dark wall sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the painting 'Starry Night' by Vincent van Gogh, hung above a bed in a bedroom setting. The core visual elements, including the swirling night sky and illuminated stars, are visible in Image B similar to Image A. The concept of it being a glow-in-the-dark wall sticker is suggested by the lighting effect, highlighting its decorative and luminescent function. Thus, Image B maintains the core visual elements while facilitating the idea of a glow-in-the-dark effect.",

      "question": "Is the glow-in-the-dark effect visible on the wall sticker depiction, indicating that it would illuminate in dark conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a lit environment with a lamp illuminating the room. There is no visible indication of a glow-in-the-dark effect actively happening on the image itself, given the ambient light present. Typically, glow-in-the-dark stickers require darkness to illuminate, and there's no evidence suggesting such an effect in Image B's depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly showcases a large 'Starry Night' painting hung above a bed within a bedroom seen with typical furniture like a bedside table and lamp. The setting is indicative of a feature wall placement, which is common for decorative wall elements in bedrooms. Thus, the wall sticker is indeed shown as applied to a feature wall within a bedroom setting.",

      "question": "Does the bedroom setting appear logically consistent and appropriate for the placement of the glow-in-the-dark wall sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bedroom setting in Image B, with standard furniture such as a bed and nightstand, reflects a common scenario where decorative elements such as paintings or wall stickers are placed. This situational context aligns with the typical use and placement of decorative items like glow-in-the-dark stickers to enhance room aesthetics or ambiance. Therefore, the setting is logically consistent and seems appropriate for such usage.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B showcase 'Starry Night,' characterized by Van Gogh's renowned style â€” expressive swirling patterns and vibrant color contrast. The aesthetic and artistic qualities, such as brush stroke simulation and night scenery, appear consistent between both images. Therefore, the artistic style and aesthetic of Image A are well preserved and reflected in Image B's depiction.",
