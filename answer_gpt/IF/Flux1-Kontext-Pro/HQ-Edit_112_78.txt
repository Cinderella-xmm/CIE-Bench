    "Question": "Q1: Has the teapot been transformed into a candle holder with a visible candle or wick structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot clearly has an opening in its body where a candle can be seen inside, giving it the appearance of a candle holder.

    "Question": "Q2: Is the body of the object now made of glass with visible intricate embossed patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the object is primarily composed of a glass material which allows visibility of the interior candle, unlike opaque materials. The intricate patterns on the glass are highlighted, resonating with the traditional style of embossing. Given the clarity of the glass and the decorative designs, it's clear that the body is both made of glass and features embossed patterns.",

    "Question": "Q3: Has the lid been redesigned into a decorative finial-style candle snuffer with a snuffing mechanism?",
    "explanation": "From Image B, the lid retains its ornamental, finial-like design but there is no visible mechanism for snuffing a candle. A functional candle snuffer usually has a movable part to cover a flame, which isn't apparent in the image. Thus, while the lid could stylistically resemble a finial, it lacks the specific functional attributes of a snuffer.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Has the tablecloth been replaced with a sleek, reflective marble base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object rests on a smooth, black base that has white veining, typical of marble. The surface is reflective, replacing any semblance of a fabric tablecloth with something solid and aesthetically different.
