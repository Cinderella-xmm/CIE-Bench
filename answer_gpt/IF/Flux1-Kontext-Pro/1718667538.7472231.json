    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger figure presents characteristics of the cut-paper style, where the edges are sharply defined, and the coloring lacks detailed shading or depth, giving a flat appearance. This is typical in cut-paper art styles or traditional printmaking, where the focus is more on solid colors and outlines than on realism.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiger's stripes visibly wider and more stylized than natural tiger markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's stripes are indeed stylized, being broader and more graphic compared to those on a natural tiger. These appear more exaggerated and artistically rendered, fitting the stylized art form present in Image B.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiger's whiskers noticeably longer and thicker than natural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the tiger's whiskers seem typical to the stylized design of the image. However, they do not appear excessively long or thick in a manner that would deviate significantly from natural proportions. They seem to align well with the artistic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kimono appear as if composed of multiple overlapping paper layers with distinct edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B displays characteristics consistent with an overlapping paper style, where elements appear layered and are given distinct edges. This impression stems from the defined lines and flat color descriptions common in layered paper artworks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there are visible gold accents within the cherry blossom patterns on the kimono, lending a decorative, metallic touch to the design. These accents contrast with the flat, painted paper style by introducing an element that suggests sheen.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
