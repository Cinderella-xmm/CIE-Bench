    "Question": "Q1: Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the dog and the banana are distinct objects placed side by side. There is no visual indication that they are combined into a single unified form. The dog stands to the left of the banana which is placed upright, both clearly separate entities.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
    "explanation": "Given Image B, there does not appear to be any blending of the dog with the banana. Therefore, there is no blending to assess for realism in appearance. Each retains its natural, realistic form without any noticeable signs of manipulation intended to combine them.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, since the dog and banana are distinct objects side by side without any blending or transitional elements connecting them, there is no transition to evaluate. They are separate, without attempted merging.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
    "explanation": "The proportions and scaling in Image B fit within real-world expectations where a small dog and a banana could be displayed together. However, since there is no blended form, there's no need to evaluate these attributes in terms of blending, but their proportions as individual items do maintain realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows consistent lighting on both the dog and the banana, indicating that they are likely in the same lighting conditions. There are no distinct blended forms to analyze, but the objects appear consistently lit in context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
