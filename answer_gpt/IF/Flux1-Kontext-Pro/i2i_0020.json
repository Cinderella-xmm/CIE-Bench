      "question": "Are the only remaining elements in the image the red-and-gray train and the \"STOP\" sign, presented with geometric color blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements are simplified, and the representation is more abstract. The train is depicted using clean and bold red-and-gray color blocks, and the 'STOP' sign is clearly visible using basic colors and shapes without detailed textures. This simplification aligns with the idea of geometric color blocks.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
