      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted as a voxel-based 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B appears to have a smooth and natural surface with detailed texturing rather than a blocky or pixelated structure that is typical of voxel models. Voxel models are known for their cubic and often simplified geometries, resembling digital blocks or pixels, while this butterfly has a realistic and fluid form indicating a more traditional 3D model rather than voxel-based.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly's design and style resemble the icons shown in the left image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are stylized, digital icons at the top left of Image B, which are simple and geometric. The butterfly itself, however, is depicted with naturalistic, smooth shapes rather than geometric or simplified forms. The design style of the butterfly does not resemble the simplistic, schematic nature of the icons.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Was the butterfly rendered in Octane at 8k resolution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is textual information in the bottom right corner of Image B indicating that the butterfly was rendered in Octane at 8k resolution. This sort of high-resolution rendering often allows for a detailed and realistic depiction with high-quality lighting and shading effects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the butterfly exhibit three-dimensional characteristics such as depth and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B shows depth and a three-dimensional appearance. The wings appear to have thickness and the body of the butterfly is rendered with shadowing that gives it a 3D form. Perspective is visible as parts of the butterfly are shadowed and lighted differently, suggesting a three-dimensional rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the butterfly display realistic lighting and shading effects indicative of being rendered in Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features complex and nuanced lighting and shading on the butterfly that showcase varying intensities and directions of light. These effects are characteristic of advanced rendering engines like Octane, known for producing highly realistic and detailed images with lifelike shading and lighting.",
