      "question": "Are the cheetah figures replaced with gold-finished perfume bottles that maintain their original seated poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures on either side of a central structure appear to be cheetah-like figures with a gold finish. The original image features cheetah figures in a seated pose, and in the edited image, these positions have remained unchanged, though they now appear to have a shiny, gold finish. Common sense suggests that these could be perfume bottles given the context of a retail display. Therefore, the cheetah figures are indeed replaced with gold-finished items that maintain a similar seated pose.",

      "question": "Has the botanical center been replaced with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade that has a cascading downward appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object has been replaced with a piece that appears to be a translucent, green-tinted glass façade. This contrasts with Image A, where the central piece has a botanical design. The glass has a faint green tint and a smooth surface, suggestive of straightforward panels rather than a cascading design. The adjective 'cascading downward' implies a moving form or fluidity, which the glass structure does not exhibit. Hence, while the botanical center has been replaced with a green-tinted glass, it doesn't have a cascading downward appearance.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" present on the bases of both objects in a chic serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bases of the objects have text; one side reads 'Savanna Essence' while the other reads 'Savanna'. The text appears to be in a serif font, often associated with elegance and chic design. This is consistent with the description provided, indicating an effort to elevate the objects' sophistication. Therefore, the text 'Savanna Essence' is present on one side in a serif font while the other side only displays 'Savanna'.",

      "question": "Does the edited image convey an elegant and luxurious aesthetic consistent with a high-end retail perfume display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts objects that have been transformed to feature a gold finish and are arranged within a setting that resembles a retail environment, suggesting luxury and elegance. Gold is commonly associated with luxury, and the use of a glass center adds to the high-end retail aesthetic. This setup, combined with the lighting and background environment, aligns with what one might expect from a high-end perfume display. Thus, the edited image does convey an elegant and luxurious aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the two gold-finished perfume bottles symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade, preserving the original spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two gold-finished objects are positioned on either side of the central glass structure, similar to the arrangement seen in Image A where the cheetahs flank the center. The symmetry observed in Image A is preserved in Image B, with each gold-finished item carefully placed on opposite sides of the central piece. This indicates a maintained spatial arrangement essential for aesthetic balance. Therefore, the bottles are symmetrically positioned and preserve the original spatial configuration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a subtle surface beneath the objects, but it does not show clear reflections of the bottles and the central glass piece. In Image A, a reflective surface is visible, but the edited image does not demonstrate the same degree of reflection or clarity. Therefore, in Image B, there is no distinct reflective surface that shows clear reflections of the objects and central façade.",
