    "Question": "Q1: Has the worker been transformed into a chibi-style 3D cartoon character?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure displayed is a chibi-style 3D character, characterized by exaggerated proportions such as a larger head and smaller body, which are common traits of chibi or cartoon characters. This transformation is evident due to these visual characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the chibi-style 3D character wear a yellow hard hat, a fluorescent yellow shirt, and an orange reflective vest?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is indeed wearing a yellow hard hat. Unlike the typical bright yellow vest seen on construction workers for high visibility, the character is wearing a yellow shirt and an orange vest with reflective strips. This aligns with common depictions of construction attire but uses a simplified color scheme typical in cartoon representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the chibi-style 3D character placed at the center of a low-poly construction scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is centrally positioned within a scene that features low-poly elements, which is evidenced by the simplified geometric shapes and basic construction equipment in the background, indicating a low-poly visual style typical in digital environments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a simplified light gray plane with a small crane model included?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is a minimally detailed light gray plane, which signifies simplicity or abstraction in design, and a small crane model is visible. This simplified setting is consistent with digital or low-poly style environments often used to emphasize the main character.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image maintain a 1:1 composition ratio?",
    "explanation": "The composition of Image B appears to be square, maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio. This can be inferred from the equal visual spacing on all sides of the central character, a common aspect ratio used in digital images, particularly for social media.",
    "answer": "Yes"
