      "question": "Does the edited image use a whimsical, playful visual style consistent with a children's treasure map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features whimsical elements such as castles, winding paths, and a large sun, all drawn in a playful manner reminiscent of children's illustrations. The use of bright colors and gentle curves further suggests a visual style akin to a children's treasure map. These elements are often associated with the playful and imaginative aspects characteristic of such maps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all major sections (e.g., Homepage, Products & Solutions) represented by fun, thematic icons instead of text labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, major sections like the 'Homepage' are still indicated with text labels rather than thematic icons. The castle represents the theme but the presence of text labels in the edited image shows that not all sections are represented by thematic icons alone.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the connections between sections represented by winding, non-linear journey trails instead of straight lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts connections as winding paths that curve throughout the landscape, steering away from the linear representation commonly seen in traditional diagrams. The winding trails evoke a sense of adventure often found in treasure maps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible decorative elements such as colorful trees, mystical creatures, or other fantasy-themed illustrations placed along the paths or around the map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image contains multiple decorative elements such as colorful trees, flowers, and fantasy-themed towers. These elements enhance the fantasy feel and contribute to the whimsical atmosphere across the landscape depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors used in the image bold and vibrant, and is the text rendered in a dynamic, storybook-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are not bold and vibrant; rather, they are soft and pastel-like, which maintains a whimsical appeal but does differ from bold coloring. The font, while somewhat whimsical, is more gentle than dynamic or storybook-style typically found in traditional fantasy texts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is the hierarchical structure of the original site map preserved despite the transformation into a treasure map style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while elements such as pathways and structures provide a sense of layout, there is no clear preservation of the hierarchical structure as seen in the original site map present in Image A. The transformation leads to a loss in clarity for the site's hierarchical organization.",
