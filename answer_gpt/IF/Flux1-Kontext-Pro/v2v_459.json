      "question": "Are the ties depicted as 3D chibi-style objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties appear to have a realistic three-dimensional appearance and texture, which is consistent with high-quality fabric. Chibi-style objects often have exaggerated, cartoon-like features and proportions, which is not the case here as the ties look like standard, realistic tie design. The details in terms of light and shadow give them a lifelike, tactile quality rather than a stylized cartoon aesthetic. Therefore, they are not 3D chibi-style objects.",

      "question": "Are the striped and polka dot patterns still vibrant and clearly visible on the 3D chibi-style ties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even though the ties in Image B are not depicted as 3D chibi-style objects, the striped and polka dot patterns remain vibrant and clearly visible. The stripes have distinct and bold colors, and the polka dots are sharp and well-defined against their background. Hence, regardless of the style, the patterns themselves are vibrant and clear.",

      "question": "Are the ties placed inside a realistic drawer setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are depicted within the confines of a drawer, complete with wood texture and a metal handle, which adds to the sense of realism. The setting resembles a drawer typically seen in a bedroom or closet where ties might naturally be stored. This creates a believable and realistic context for the placement of the ties.",

      "question": "Are the ties arranged in a way that suggests they are part of an ornamental display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are placed neatly inside a drawer, laid out side by side. While not formally displayed on stands or decorative settings, the neat arrangement can still suggest a presentation style intended for display or easy access, somewhat ornamental but more practical in nature compared to traditional ornamental displays.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the original vibrant colors and patterns of the ties been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with the description of Image A, the vibrant colors and clear patterns of the ties are consistently preserved in both images. The edited image maintains the original look and feel by retaining the stripes' hues and polka dot clarity, showing no significant alteration to the tie's appearance in terms of color vibrancy or pattern definition.",
