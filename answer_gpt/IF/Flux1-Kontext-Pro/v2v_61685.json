      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit characteristics of a Swiss Design poster, such as clean lines, minimalism, and a focus on typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the design exhibits features commonly seen in Swiss Design posters. The lines are crisp and straight, representing minimalism and simplicity. The layout minimizes unnecessary details, focusing on flat, simple shapes to create clear and impactful visuals, which are hallmarks of Swiss Design. The text 'SKATE FOR ALL' enhances the focus on typography with a clean sans serif font. These elements are typical of Swiss Design posters, known for their clean lines, use of simple shapes, and emphasis on typography.",

      "question": "Is the layout of the edited image strongly asymmetrical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image's layout has a largely symmetrical appearance. Both the child and adult figures are centrally positioned with text balanced across the top. While there is slight asymmetry in the positioning of the figures, the overall design maintains a balanced and harmonious look, with elements placed methodically around the central axis. This suggests the layout is not strongly asymmetrical.",

      "question": "Have the human figures and the background tent been simplified into flat graphic shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image, it is evident that both the human figures and the background tent are transformed into flat graphic shapes. The characters are stylized with distinct low-detail color blocks, and there is a lack of texture, shading, or intricate details in both the people and items such as the tent. This style aligns with a minimalist graphic approach to simplify visual elements into flat shapes.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the edited image restricted to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt as an accent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the color palette is distinctly limited. The primary colors used are variations of blue and white, which dominate the sky, tent, and some aspects of clothing. The green shirt on the man provides a contrasting accent color, making his figure stand out. This careful restriction of colors to blues, whites, with an accent in green, is clearly observed in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The phrase 'SKATE FOR ALL' in the edited image is prominently featured in a bold, clean sans serif typeface. It is visually striking and placed across the upper region of the sky, where clouds are depicted. This placement ensures visibility and impact, drawing attention to the message through a straightforward typography style, which fits the characteristics of a sans serif typeface.",
