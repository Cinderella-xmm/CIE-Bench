      "question": "Does the elephant’s skin feature a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s skin is not just the typical gray texture one would expect from a real elephant. Instead, it features vivid colors and patterns resembling those of a galaxy, with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls. This celestial pattern is intentionally designed to give the elephant a mythical, otherworldly appearance, which is noticeable through the use of blues and purples along with star-like specks on its body.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant’s tusks exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance with glowing, cloud-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tusks of the elephant are depicted with an ethereal quality that resembles a nebula, featuring a glowing, cloud-like texture. This is achieved through the use of bright, light-emitting colors that create an illusion of a nebula, adding to the cosmic theme of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the elephant’s ears replaced with vast, sail-like structures that reflect starry constellations and have a celestial appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears are not replaced by sail-like structures. Instead, they retain their natural shape but are enhanced with a celestial effect. The ears reflect starry constellations, contributing to their celestial appearance by exhibiting the same galaxy-inspired patterns found on the rest of the elephant’s skin.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the elephant’s trunk emit a visible, swirling cosmic mist composed of glowing particles or nebula-like vapor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's trunk does emit a visible, swirling cosmic mist that appears to be composed of ethereal, glowing particles or vapor. This artistic addition to the trunk reinforces the cosmic theme of the image, making the elephant appear as if it's part of a fantastical universe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there radiant, glowing planetary rings encircling the elephant’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible planetary rings encircling the elephant’s legs. The image focuses on the cosmic texture of the skin and the glowing mist from the trunk rather than adding elements like planetary rings around the legs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the elephant’s feet display luminescent star patterns that glow visibly against the skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's feet blend into the cosmic theme with luminescent star patterns that are visible against the skin. This aligns with the galaxy motif, and the use of glowing star patterns on the feet is consistent with the rest of the cosmic design applied to the elephant's body.",
