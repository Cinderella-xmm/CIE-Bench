      "question": "Is the image presented as a snow globe resting on a rustic wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show a round object with the photographed subjects inside, placed on a wooden base resting on a shelf. This closely resembles a snow globe. The wooden surface where the globe is placed has a rustic appearance, indicating that it is indeed a wooden shelf. The context of an object inside a globe on a shelf is a common depiction of a snow globe display.",

      "question": "Are the surroundings faded into a vintage baseball clubhouse backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background within the globe appears to be a standard outdoor baseball field visible through the glass, with no significant alteration to suggest a vintage style or clubhouse setting. A vintage baseball clubhouse typically features warm tones, wood textures, and memorabilia, which are not evident in the image.",

      "question": "Does soft sunlight filter through the globe, creating warm, golden reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The globe depicted in Image B is clear and does not show any distinct sunlight filtering or golden reflections inside or around it. The lighting appears neutral rather than suggestive of sunlight causing warm reflections, as a warm glow would typically be seen as yellow or gold light spilling from the object.",

      "question": "Are the characters inside the globe depicted as cheerful chibi-style 3D figures in baseball uniforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the globe in Image B, the subjects maintain a realistic style similar to the original photograph rather than a chibi-style, which depicts cartoon-like, exaggerated figures typically with large heads and small bodies. The subjects in Image B appear true to their realistic proportions wearing baseball uniforms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the subjects standing on what appears to be grass within the globe, but there is no indication of a baseball field or fence with bats. The globe's base is filled with a material resembling snow, but the scene doesn't expand into a baseball field with props beyond the photographed individuals.",
