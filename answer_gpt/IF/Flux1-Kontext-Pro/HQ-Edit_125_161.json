    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the spiral staircase been fully replaced by a serpent-shaped form that follows the same helical path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral staircase has been replaced by a coiled serpent figure, which assumes a similar helical path as the original staircase. The serpent's body is coiled in a manner that mirrors the spiral nature of the staircase, confirming this transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body feature detailed lattice-like scales across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the serpent's body is covered with scales that exhibit a distinct lattice-like pattern. This pattern can be identified by the interlocking scale design, typical of a lattice, giving the serpent a textured appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s body extended downward in a way that visually replicates the step-like descent of the original staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the serpent coiling upward without a direct replication of the step-like descent seen in a staircase. The serpent is more continuous and smooth in its form rather than segmented like steps, thus it does not replicate the descend of a staircase.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ornate, filigree-like patterns present on the serpent’s body, matching the style of the original railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the serpent's scales are detailed, they do not have the same ornate, filigree-like patterns that are present on the original staircase's railing, which were more open and decorative. The serpent's scales are more reptilian and less ornamental.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the banister been replaced with a series of delicate, translucent fins along the serpent’s side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no delicate, translucent fins present along the serpent's side. The depiction is of solid, textured scales without any fin-like structures that would replace a banister.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a serpent’s head positioned at the uppermost point of the spiral, featuring two distinct luminescent gem-like eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a serpent head at the uppermost part of the spiral. The head does have two eyes, which are distinctly luminescent and gem-like, standing out against the rest of the body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body display a marble-like texture with visible veining and polished surface characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B does not exhibit a marble-like texture. Instead, it has a matte, textured finish due to its scale pattern. There is no indication of visible veining or a polished surface characteristic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
