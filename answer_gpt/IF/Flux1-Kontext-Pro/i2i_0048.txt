    "Question": "Q1: Has the contrast in the image been enhanced?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra stands out more distinctly against the background compared to what might be expected in a natural savanna setting. The shadows on the zebras and on the ground are more pronounced, indicating an increase in contrast compared to a typical natural environment lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there visible improvement in the sharpness of zebras and the grassy ground in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the detail in the zebras' stripes is clear, but there is no grass visible like in a natural savanna. Instead, there's an urban ground setting which highlights the zebras more. The sharpness is more about the cleared separation from the background, rather than detail improvement on grasses (since they are absent).",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the natural textures of the zebras' stripes and the grassland detailed and clear?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras' stripes are detailed and clear, showing each pattern distinctly. However, there is no grassland present, as the setting has been replaced with an urban environment (asphalt or concrete). Thus, the natural texture of grassland is not applicable here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Have any urban elements, like buildings, vehicles, or people, been added to simulate a city life photojournalism aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Image B has introduced a context that resembles an urban setting with what appears to be solid walls or structures in the background. This implies a deliberate introduction of urban elements to create a city-like environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the original composition of the zebras in the grassland been preserved?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the zebras are posed similarly to Image A, the surrounding environment has significantly changed from grassland to an urban setting. This indicates that the composition involving the natural grassland has not been preserved as it transitioned into a different background entirely.",
    "answer": "No"
