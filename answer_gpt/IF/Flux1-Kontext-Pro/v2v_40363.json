      "question": "Is the entire image composed of small, distinct mosaic tiles with visible grout lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a wall with brick patterns, not a mosaic style. Mosaic tiles have distinct small pieces with visible grout lines, which are not present here. Instead, the image depicts a painted mural on a brick wall with identifiable brick lines but not mosaic grout lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vivid and saturated, particularly the red heart balloon and the child's features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the colors appear vibrant and saturated. The red heart and balloon stand out with a deep, vivid color, and the blues and yellows in the background, along with the child's features, have a saturated tone. The contrast and brightness are notable, indicating vividness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the heart balloon and the child clearly defined and emphasized in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the heart and the child are clearly defined with sharp edges as expected in a painted mural. However, they do not follow the mosaic style, which would typically involve broken, less precise lines due to the tile shapes. The edges are drawn with precision typical of a painted mural.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and all essential elements from the original image been maintained in the mosaic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the essential elements like the heart balloon and the child pointing at it are maintained. The composition has not changed significantly, indicating consistency between the versions, maintaining the overall artistic expression, aside from minor color adjustments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the material of the artwork reflect the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles, such as a glossy or matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork in Image B does not reflect characteristics typical of ceramic mosaic tiles. Instead, it shows a painted surface on a brick wall. Mosaic tiles have a characteristic texture and reflective quality, which is absent here; the image instead resembles a typical paint finish on an outdoor mural.",
