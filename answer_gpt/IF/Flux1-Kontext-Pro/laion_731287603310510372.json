        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition, typography, and design elements such as silhouettes and a sepia tone contribute to the style of a vintage detective movie poster.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
