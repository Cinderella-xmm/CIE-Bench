        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central objects are an elephant and a backpack. A classic LEGO minifigure is a small, humanoid toy figure with very distinct features such as a cylindrical head and a blocky body shape. The elephant and backpack do not resemble LEGO minifigures. Given this description, the edited image does not have a LEGO-style minifigure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is primarily depicted in natural tones typical of elephants, mainly consisting of brown and gray shades. The backpack is rich red.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects, including the elephant and backpack, are placed within a clear, transparent structure resembling a glass cube. This is consistent with a display encased within a glass box or cube, as observed in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the miniature scene resting on a base that is predominantly black. The description does not mention any obvious silver details on the base itself; the base looks like a single material or color without contrasting metallic-like decorations. Therefore, the presence of silver details is not confirmed.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there is a visible black base which features an engraved nameplate that reads 'African Elephant' with additional text that appears to provide biological classification information. This detail clearly corresponds to the cited description.",
