    "Question": "Q2: Does the image use soft lighting to highlight the thermometer's metallic finish and clearly visible dial?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, soft lighting can be observed through the gentle shadows and highlights on the metal finish of the thermometer, enhancing its three-dimensional look and visibility of details on the dial. This kind of lighting helps bring out the metallic quality and ensures all the markings are legible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] clearly incorporated into the image?",
    "explanation": "There are no specific stats labeled [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] in Image B. The visible numbers and indications on the thermometer face specify the regular temperature range, but these precise stats are absent.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a title banner at the top labeled 'Precision Thermal Gauge'?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes a clearly visible title banner at the top, which states 'PRECISION THERMAL GAUGE'. This label suggests an emphasis on accuracy and quality of the instrument.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a nameplate at the bottom identifying the item's designation?",
    "explanation": "A nameplate is present at the bottom in Image B, which identifies the item with the word 'THERMOMETER'. This serves to classify and provide context to the depicted instrument.",
