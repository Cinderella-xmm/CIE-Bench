      "question": "Does the character retain the original shell structure and turtle attributes, reimagined in a cute, chibi-style design with long legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a character that retains turtle shell attributes, seen as a shell on the back, and turtle-like facial features. The design is chibi-style, evident from the large head and smaller body proportions typical for chibi designs. The character does have long legs compared to the stubby legs of a real turtle, indicating the reimagining in chibi-style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character dressed in stylish designer clothing, wearing small glasses on the head, and carrying a sketchbook or tablet secured behind the shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character wears stylish clothing like a suit jacket, shirt, and pants, suggestive of designer wear. The character is wearing large glasses on the face rather than small glasses on the head, which makes a distinction, and there is no sketchbook or tablet visible behind the shell.",

      "question": "Does the character have tiny, chic accessories like a scarf or a small designer bag to complement the look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features small accessories next to the character's clothing selection, including sunglasses and a designer bag. However, a scarf does not complement the character directly in the visible attire; rather, it is positioned as part of the array of clothing pieces. The character itself is accessorized modestly with the items visible in the image.",

      "question": "Is the background a solid color that harmonizes with the characterâ€™s overall color scheme, with no gradients or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid light pink color that complements the character's outfit palette, consisting of blue and brown tones. There are no gradients or textures visible, maintaining harmony with the overall scheme.",

      "question": "Does the image have an aspect ratio of 9:16, with \"OOTD\" as top text, the full-body character on the left, and individual clothing pieces/accessories on the right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows 'OOTD' at the top and aligns the full-body character on the left with clothing pieces and accessories on the right, the aspect ratio does not appear to be 9:16. It seems closer to a standard square or 4:5 frame for balanced presentation rather than vertical 9:16 format.",
