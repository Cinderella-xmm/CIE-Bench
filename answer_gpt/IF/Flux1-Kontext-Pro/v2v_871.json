      "question": "Is the image vertically oriented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is broader than it is tall, which indicates a landscape orientation rather than a vertical or portrait orientation. The transparency of the display box and reflection visible confirms the orientation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has a traditional LEGO minifigure been added next to the pear-inspired animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a LEGO minifigure can be seen standing inside the glass container next to the pear. Its recognizable block-like, yellow skin and articulated limbs make it easily identifiable as a traditional LEGO character.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pear-inspired animal feature a polished, seamless style with a bitten section that complements the pear's characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pear in Image B does not appear to be an animal. Rather, it is an actual fruit presented with a bite taken out of its side. Its form is simple and natural, with a bitten section that maintains the natural characteristics of an actual pear.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both figures enclosed within a transparent glass cube that reflects the natural wood grain look and color of the backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the LEGO minifigure and the pear are indeed enclosed within a transparent glass or plastic container. However, it's observed against a neutral, light brown background. The container does not reflect a wood grain look, just the backdrop itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image utilize sophisticated lighting with warm hues that align with the original photo's tones, and does the background transition smoothly from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B creates a warm and neutral tone, harmonious with the colors of the background: a soft light brown that mimics a wood or caramel color. However, there is no significant gradient shift observed to a different cream tone; it remains consistent in shade.",
