    "Question": "Q1: Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the building architecture with defined lines and edges, giving it a stylized and sharp appearance. This suggests an artistic rendition leaning towards a paper-cut art style, where sharp and angular edges are often used to create crisp, clear visuals. However, the style is not overly exaggerated to mimic paper-cut art strictly, but it does maintain a distinct, clean look.",
    "answer": "No"
