      "question": "Has the food been rearranged into a Michelin-style plating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plate with food items arranged in a visually appealing and artistic manner. The sliced carrots are positioned like rays radiating outward, and sauce drops of different colors are strategically placed around the plate. This arrangement resembles the fine dining presentation often seen in Michelin-starred restaurants, where emphasis is placed on aesthetics as much as taste.",

      "question": "Is the steak spiral-rolled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a piece of meat that is circular and has a spiral appearance on the left side of the plate. The presentation suggests it has been rolled before being sliced, creating a spiral pattern that can be seen on its cross-section.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Are the carrots cut into a fan-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots are cut into elongated triangular strips and placed in a configuration that resembles a fan, with the narrow points meeting near the center and the wider ends spreading outwards, creating a fan-like shape.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have sauce dots been added to each vegetable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows various sauce dots surrounding the other food elements but not each specific vegetable. These dots are distributed around the central arrangement, adding to the overall presentation style. This suggests a selective artistic placement rather than associating each dot with a specific vegetable.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food is arranged on a circular plate with a large surface area, typical of those used for serving dishes. The plate appears to be made of ceramic with a glossy, white finish, which is common in modern culinary presentations.",
