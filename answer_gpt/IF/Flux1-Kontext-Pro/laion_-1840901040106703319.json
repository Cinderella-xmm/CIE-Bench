      "question": "Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure visible is a geometric crystal structure made up of transparent, faceted surfaces. The visual cue is the detailed crystal structure comprising of glass-like panels, which indicates a replacement of what could be a simpler structure, such as a log cabin. Therefore, it has been replaced by a crystal structure in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior surfaces of the crystal structure are composed of transparent, faceted planes. The way light interacts with these surfaces suggests reflection and refraction, producing blue and green hues, likely due to the crystal's transparent nature combined with the surrounding light conditions. This illustrates the presence of such hues.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features a crystal structure with what appears to be meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges, indicating a replacement of any previous structural elements that could include wooden beams, as seen in traditional structures such as log cabins. This replacement suggests the transformation into a crystal-based framework.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the crystal structure in Image B looks like it is resting on a flat, white platform, which has the appearance of marble due to its smooth and polished characteristics. This visual information combined with knowledge of typical marble textures suggests that it is indeed a marble platform.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small crystal formations present as decorative accents along the base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the crystal structure includes various small crystal formations that appear as decorative elements. These formations are visible around the base of the primary structure and serve as embellishments, enhancing the aesthetic via their distinct crystalline appearance.",
