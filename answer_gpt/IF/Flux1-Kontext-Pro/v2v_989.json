      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog is illustrated in a style that retains realistic proportions rather than featuring chibi characteristics. Chibi style typically involves oversized heads, large eyes, and small bodies for a cute, exaggerated appearance. This style does not apply to Image B, where the dog is shown with normal proportions and without exaggerated features.",

      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag are depicted with simplified shapes and solid colors, characteristic of a minimalist flat design. This style avoids the use of gradients, shadows, or 3D effects, focusing instead on clear, straight-forward lines and solid blocks of color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog does not stand out as the most prominent element. The bench and the items on it are equally or more emphasized due to their position and size relative to the dog. The dog's characteristics are simplified to fit the illustration style, not preserved in detail or prominence.",

      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a bold white outline that surrounds the entire illustration, providing a clear separation from the background and enhancing the visual appeal typical of sticker or icon designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the dog and bench are contained within the circular frame, with no elements extending beyond the boundaries of the circular field on which the illustration is placed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a solid color background within its circular frame rather than transparency. The greenish color fills the space behind the objects, showing that the background is not transparent.",
