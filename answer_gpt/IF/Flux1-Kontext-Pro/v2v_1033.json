      "question": "Are the collectibles depicted as exquisitely detailed 3D-rendered figures of a bee and a flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee and flower appear as enamel pins, characterized by their flat, outlined design and vibrant colors typical of such accessories. They are not depicted as 3D-rendered figures; instead, they maintain a two-dimensional appearance commonly seen in enamel pins. Therefore, they do not possess the detailed 3D characteristics expected from high-detail renderings.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a box for the enamel pins that is pastel-colored with a soft cream hue.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee and flower enamel pins are displayed side by side within the box.

      "question": "Does the bee figurine have vibrant, glossy yellow and black stripes along with sparkling, semi-translucent wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bee pin in Image B has vibrant yellow and black stripes; however, its wings are not sparkling or semi-translucent. Instead, the wings are filled with opaque enamel as typical in pins, lacking the semi-translucent quality described. Thus, while the colors are vibrant, the specific qualities of the wings do not match the description provided.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid features the inscription “ETERNITY BLOSSOM.” It is accompanied by small decorative elements such as stars; however, there are no evident floral designs encircling the phrase. The decorations are primarily star-shaped, indicating a more celestial theme rather than a floral one.",
