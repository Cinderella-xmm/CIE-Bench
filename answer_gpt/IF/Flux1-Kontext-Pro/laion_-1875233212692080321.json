      "question": "Has the original rose petals been completely replaced by a perfume bottle design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the prominent feature is a perfume bottle. Unlike an image that would feature rose petals simply scattered or on their own, this bottle has a stylized rose element at its cap. Based on world knowledge, rose petals indicate a natural or floral theme, whereas a perfume bottle suggests a man-made, crafted design. Thus, the original rose petals, if any, seem to be completely replaced by a perfume bottle's design that complements both perfume and rose motifs.",
