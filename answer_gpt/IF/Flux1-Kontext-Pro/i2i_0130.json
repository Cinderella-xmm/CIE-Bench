        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure surrounding the fireplace includes arches and stone carvings, which are typical architectural elements found in medieval castles.

      "question": "Is the fireplace in the image grander compared to the original one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fireplace is surrounded by ornate, gothic stone carvings, lending it a majestic and grand appearance.

      "question": "Have the bookshelves been replaced with stone carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B retains bookshelves, they are accompanied by stone architecture which gives them a more integrated and permanent look typical within castle interiors. There are additional stone elements around the fireplace that enhance the medieval design, but the core function of bookshelves remains. Therefore, the bookshelves themselves have not been explicitly replaced with stone carvings.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses gothic arches, stone carvings, and traditionally styled furniture, all of which are design elements associated with medieval architecture. The warm lighting and central fireplace contribute to this ambience, offering a sense of enchantment associated with medieval settings. These choices collectively create a medieval feel, enhanced by the depiction's dramatic and otherworldly tone.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features distinct architectural elements such as gothic arches and stone mantelpieces, characteristic of medieval castle interiors.
