      "question": "Are there exactly three distinct postcards visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct sections that appear like postcards. There are three segments featuring portions of the embroidered dress: one showing the upper portion, another showing the full dress, and one with folded embroidery. They each offer a unique perspective, which suggests that there are exactly three distinct postcards visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is one of the postcards rendered with a blue gradient that emphasizes the embroidered dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a section that highlights the embroidered dress predominantly using a blue gradient. This is evident as the entire dress section is showcased in shades of blue that naturally highlight the embroidered details on the dress due to the contrast with the silver embroidery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is one of the postcards rendered in silver tones, specifically emphasizing the hair accessory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the visible postcards do not prominently feature silver tones that would specifically emphasize the hair accessory. Silver appears as part of the embroidery details rather than as a dominant tone across a postcard.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, none of the visible postcards incorporate stylized bamboo patterns as a dominant visual element. The bamboo background is seen, but not as the primary focus of any postcard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, multiple pieces resembling postcards are shown alongside book covers. Although the book covers feature embroidery-inspired designs, it's not clear that the entire set of postcards is presented within these books, suggesting a more separated display.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral and scroll motifs on the garment in Image B do exhibit characteristics resembling paper-cut effects. They have sharp edges, a layered appearance, and show high contrast against the blue dress, giving the impression of being cut out precisely and displayed prominently.",
