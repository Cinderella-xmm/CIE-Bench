      "question": "Does the figurine appear to be made of polished wood, with visible wood grain and a smooth, reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the figurine displays characteristics typical of wood, such as the presence of a smooth surface and visible fine details that are consistent with polished wood finishing. The surface does not appear highly reflective but has the matte sheen that polished wood can exhibit. The coloration and texture suggest a material like wood, with possible visible grain giving more depth.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black and white areas of the dog's fur represented using contrasting natural wood tones (dark vs. light)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine shows a variation in tone in the areas where the fur would naturally be black and white. These variations appear to be made using different tones of wood, utilizing darker and lighter wood colors to mimic the contrast one would see in fur coloration without actual color application.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the figurineâ€™s contours appear smooth and rounded, avoiding sharp or angular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The contours of the figurine in Image B are smooth and rounded, consistent with the style often found in wooden carvings. There are no sharp or angular edges apparent, which aligns with the common practice of smoothing edges in wood crafting for a more polished and gentle appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth enhanced with visible fine carved lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes, nose, and muzzle area in Image B seem to be detailed with carved features that use shallow lines and subtle depth changes to define these facial characteristics. This carving technique is common in wood sculpture to add detail and realism, although the face is blurred and this conclusion is drawn from general crafting logic.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is seated on a simple wooden base that complements the figurine through its consistent use of polished wood. This platform looks minimalist, emphasizing the carved piece while matching the overall wooden aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of wooden textures and soft, subtle lighting along with a more muted color scheme helps to highlight the craftsmanship aspect of the figurine. The emphasis is on the natural beauty and details of the wood rather than bright and contrasting colors, creating a different visual emphasis compared to the original design in Image A.",
