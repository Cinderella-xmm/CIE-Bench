      "question": "Has the overall form of the statue been reshaped into a recognizable perfume bottle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key object has been transformed into a bottle-like form, featuring a stopper typical of perfume bottles, which implies a structural reshaping from a statue to a perfume bottle. The visual cues in Image B suggest a cylindrical base with an elegant glass stopper, characteristic of a perfume bottle. Based on these observations, the form has indeed been reshaped into a perfume bottle structure.",

      "question": "Has the jug been replaced with an ornate glass stopper positioned at the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a glass stopper at the top of the bottle, which is absent from Image A where a jug is present. The ornate glass stopper is indicative of traditional perfume bottles, replacing the functional jug seen in Image A. Thus, it can be concluded that the jug has been replaced by a glass stopper in Image B.",

      "question": "Has the robe been transformed into a smooth, elegant bottle-shaped body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be a robe in Image A has been visually transformed into part of the bottle's body, which appears smooth and elegant. The draping feature is incorporated into the bottleâ€™s design, transitioning from the natural texture of a robe to the sleek form of a bottle body. This combined analysis suggests the robe's transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined goose-shaped charm present as a decorative element on or near the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a goose-shaped charm. Instead, a grape bunch charm is attached, whereas in Image A, a goose forms a part of the statue representation. Thus, in Image B, there is no goose-shaped charm present.",

      "question": "Are the dominant colors earthy tones (e.g., brown, tan, terracotta) with visible gold accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors are indeed earthy tones with shades of brown and tan, complemented with noticeable gold accents, particularly on the foliage motifs and accents on the bottle. These colors and accents match the description provided, confirming the choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays grapevine patterns on the surface of the bottle, which appear either engraved or embossed. This texture contrasts with Image A where the grapevine is part of a basket. The visual cues in Image B clearly indicate such patterns are present on the bottle's surface which supports the assertion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a cardboard package adjacent to the bottle. The package features classical art motifs with a printed design that reflects traditional aesthetics. Although material and finish are difficult to ascertain visually, the appearance suggests a matte finish due to its non-glossy texture.",
