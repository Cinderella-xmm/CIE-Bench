    "Question": "Q1: Is the image presented as part of a multi-panel postcard set with a gymnastics theme?",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the contortionist’s silhouette feature visible brushstroke textures across its form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the gymnast is depicted without clear brushstroke textures. The artwork is smooth and digitally rendered with gradients and shading rather than brushstrokes. Therefore, it lacks the visible brushstroking typical of hand-painted pieces, opting instead for a polished digital illustration.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the hands significantly enlarged compared to the rest of the body to emphasize grip strength?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the proportions in Image B, the hands do not appear significantly enlarged compared to the rest of the body.

    "Question": "Q4: Are the legs visibly elongated beyond natural proportions to enhance dynamic movement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the gymnast are depicted with a natural length and proportion relative to the rest of the body. They are positioned dynamically, which naturally creates an illusion of extension and movement, common in illustrations to emphasize action, but they are not elongated beyond plausible proportions.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are gradients of blue and silver applied across the figure’s form to highlight shape and contour?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure of the gymnast is highlighted with gradients of blue and silver across the leotard, which effectively accentuates the contours and musculature. This choice of color enhances the form and provides depth to the illustration, aiding in the visual clarity and definition of the figure's body.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are swirling ribbons and star motifs present in the image to convey action and dynamism?",
    "explanation": "Image B incorporates swirling ribbons and star motifs prominently in the background.

These motifs effectively contribute to the dynamic visual appeal of the artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the image displayed on panels with matte finish and rounded corners, resembling collectible postcards?",
    "explanation": "The visual presentation of Image B suggests that it is mounted or framed through the corner overlays, preconceiving it as part of a set. While matte finish and rounded corners are typical of collectible postcards, the apparent detail and composition cannot confirm those specific features without explicit visual cues like a matte texture or rounded edges being visibly detailed.",
    "answer": "No"
