    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is clearly visible inside a dome-like structure, which is transparent and appears to be glass. This visual cue suggests that the teapot is indeed encased within a glass dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is seated on a base with ornate detailing that matches the design of the teapot, but it doesn't appear to be a reflective mirrored surface. The surface seems to be made of materials that do not reflect light like a mirror would.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small porcelain cups arranged in a circle around the base of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a few small cups placed around the base of the teapot, which appear to be made of porcelain. They are arranged near the teapot, corroborating the idea of being placed in a certain order around it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there additional tiny, detailed engravings visible on the elevated surfaces of the teapot, amplifying its existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B has detailed engravings that cover its surface. These engravings seem to be part of its original design, consistent with a highly ornate style, rather than additional engravings added to an already existing pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible faux steam spirals rising upward from the teapot, forming curved, wispy trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible spirals that appear to be representing steam emanating from the teapot. These appear as curved, wispy trails reminiscent of steam rising, indicating the presence of artificial or faux steam effects in the image.",
