      "question": "Are all makeup brushes replaced with sculpted crystal wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects in the container are tall, transparent, and have an appearance consistent with crystal or glass wands. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about sculpted crystal wands, these objects match such a description. They all appear uniform in style and material, which marks a clear departure from typical makeup brushes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does each crystal wand have a unique gemstone at its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the crystal wands all have a similar faceted design at the tip. From the image, they appear identical in shape and size, suggesting that there is no variability to indicate uniquely different gemstones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the container a transparent crystal vase with visible etched floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The container in Image B is transparent and appears to have etched patterns. Based on the visual presentation that aligns with common characteristics of crystal vases, it does feature etched designs similar to floral patterns, which are highly visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the lace band been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace band is still visibly a textile material with a lace pattern rather than a carved crystal. There are no visual cues indicating a hard, carved form inconsistent with the flexibility and texture of lace.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire arrangement placed on a mirrored surface that reflects the crystal vase and wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the container and wands in Image B are reflected below them, suggesting they are placed on a surface capable of light reflection, like a mirror. The visibility of the reflection of the vase and wands indicates a mirrored surface.",
