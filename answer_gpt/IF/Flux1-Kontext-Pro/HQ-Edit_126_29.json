      "question": "Is the room visually transformed into a thematic infographic with Victorian literature elements, including layout and design consistent with an educational or narrative display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual layout has shifted from a realistic room setting to a drawn, illustrative format reminiscent of a book illustration or an educational poster. The intricate line drawings, captions, and organized structure of information are consistent with thematic infographics, particularly those focusing on literary or historical subjects. The details and stylized presentation suggest a focus on narration or education, combining visual art with text in a Victorian style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the clock face been replaced with a visual representation of a book with animated or implied page-turning motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face remains a traditional clock face showing time with typical Roman numerals. There is no depiction of a book or any indication of a page-turning motion within this element. The clock face is part of the overall artistic depiction, thus maintaining its role as a time-telling device without being substituted for another object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible text snippets on the wallpaper that detail historical milestones in timekeeping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stylized text and illustrative captions, focusing on thematic elements related to time, which are part of the thematic design. However, there is no evidence of wallpaper text specifically detailing the history of timekeeping in a usual decorative wallpaper context. The text is part of the drawn infographic layout rather than being on wallpaper.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the framed artwork above the fireplace now display an image of an ancient sundial instead of a landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork above the fireplace does not show a distinct depiction of a sundial. The visual representation seems focused on the clock and related elements, but the artwork retains its illustrative connection to the central theme, not explicitly replaced with a sundial.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock hands visibly designed as stylized pens, incorporated into the book cover illustration on the clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands do not resemble stylized pens and there is no indication of incorporation into a book cover on the clock face. Instead, the clock face remains consistent with traditional design, displaying regular clock hands to indicate time.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases captions and text consistent with a Victorian or art-nouveau style, using serif fonts and decorative elements that include flourishes and organic curves. These stylistic choices align with the illustrative nature of the infographic, which ties into the thematic presentation.",
