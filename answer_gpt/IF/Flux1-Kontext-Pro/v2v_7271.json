      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the laundromat and the person holding laundry, depicted using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation of the person, their clothing, and the laundromat environment is consistent with the aesthetic of Lego models. The texture and shapes of the elements such as the walls, the doors, and the washing machines resemble Lego bricks. The person is designed with features matching a Lego figure, including simplified and geometric shapes typical of Lego design. Therefore, the scene is depicted using Lego bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the person and the folded laundry represented as Lego figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The person in Image B appears as a Lego figure characterized by blocky shapes and a simplified, stylized form. Similarly, the laundry they are holding is shaped to match the expected design of Lego objects with solid colors and uniform shapes. This indicates that both the person and the folded laundry are represented using the Lego aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the laundromat environment, including the walls, doors, and washing machines, constructed using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, elements like walls, doors, and washing machines are depicted with forms and textures that resemble Lego architecture. The brick-like texture of the walls, the flat surfaces with edge details on the doors, and the simplified shapes of washing machines suggest a construction using Lego bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the scene have a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene, including the person and surrounding environment, appears to be constructed with meticulous positioning typical of dioramas seen in stop-motion animations. Every element maintains a fixed position and has the characteristic rigidity and permanence associated with stop-motion dioramas, achieved through detailed Lego design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the overall scene composition been maintained while adapting it to the Lego aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A with Image B shows that while the aesthetic has shifted to Lego, the fundamental composition remains intact. The arrangement of the person in front of the laundromat with folded laundry is preserved. Despite the transformation into Lego forms, the layout in Image B mirrors the original scene in terms of structure and placement.",
