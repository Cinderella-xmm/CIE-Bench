    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pigeon rendered as a plush toy with soft, rounded features and a fabric-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pigeon appears to have a soft, fabric-like texture which is characteristic of plush toys. Its features appear rounded and exhibit a textile texture, indicating a plush toy representation. Common knowledge about plush toys supports this visual conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a vibrant blue chest and gray wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pigeon displays a clearly vibrant blue color on its chest, while the wings appear gray. The specific color combination provides evidence of such color traits. Common knowledge of pigeon coloring can corroborate these observations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there subtle feather-like patterns visible on the surface of the plush pigeon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows subtle feather-like patterns on the plush toy pigeon, seen in the wings. These patterns emulate real feathers, which is typical in plush objects designed to resemble real animals. This observation aids in understanding the texture design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the architectural structures in the background rendered as cookie-like forms with embossed or textured surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural features appear to have an embossed, textured surface, reminiscent of cookies. This observation hints at the structures being represented as decorative or cookie-like items, fitting a common theme of edible textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Is the plush pigeon positioned on a simple wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the plush pigeon standing on a wooden shelf. The shelf appears plain and simple, which is visually distinct due to its straightforward design and material nature, indicating a typical shelf placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the soft, plush texture of the pigeon and the hard, embossed texture of the cookie architecture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, We observe distinct textural differences between the pigeon and the architecture. The pigeon is soft and plush, while the architecture exhibits a hard, embossed texture. These observations visually confirm contrasting materials and textures, commonly understood through tactile experiences.",
