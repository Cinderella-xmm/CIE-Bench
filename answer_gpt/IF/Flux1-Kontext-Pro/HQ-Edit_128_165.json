      "question": "Has the ornate lantern been fully transformed into a jellyfish shape, with a bell-shaped body and flowing appendages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object features a distinct dome or bell shape reminiscent of a jellyfish, with long, flowing tendrils extending from the base, typical of a jellyfish anatomy. This transformation involves both the shape and the addition of structures that mimic a jellyfish's appendages. Hence, the ornate lantern has indeed been transformed into the shape of a jellyfish.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the metal framing elements been replaced with iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils extending from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has tendril-like structures that emanate from the underside of the dome-shaped body, resembling the appendages of a jellyfish. These tendrils have a bright, glowing appearance, which suggests they are meant to look iridescent and delicate, similar to ribbons. This transformation indicates that the metal elements have been replaced by these tendrils.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the glass panels been transformed into a translucent, bell-shaped body that appears soft and fluid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the jellyfish maintains a dome shape, and the surface is translucent and has a fluid-like appearance, which matches the characteristics of a jellyfishâ€™s body. This suggests that the glass panels have been transformed into a depiction of a jellyfish's soft, translucent bell-shaped body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original patterns replaced with glowing, swirling, organic bioluminescent designs within the jellyfish's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns visible within the dome resemble glowing, swirling designs, typical of bioluminescence seen in some jellyfish. These elements create a visual that aligns more closely with natural bioluminescent organisms than the original ornamental design, showing a transformation in the visual patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing, star-like nodules visible along the length of the iridescent tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visible nodules are scattered along the tendrils of the jellyfish, and they seem to have a luminescent, star-like quality. This addition gives a more detailed and organic appearance, which is different from the rigid metal framing of the lantern. Thus, these nodules are present and visually glowing along the jellyfish's tendrils.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the jellyfish depicted floating in an underwater environment with ambient lighting, soft diffusion, and visual elements suggesting water (e.g., particles, light rays, depth)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the jellyfish in surroundings characterized by bluish ambient light and visible particles, typical of an underwater scene. The soft diffusion of light and shadows, as well as the perceived depth due to the darker areas in the background, further indicates an underwater environment. Thus, it effectively creates the impression of being submerged underwater.",
