      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the warrior statue composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with visible brick-like elements forming its body, limbs, and head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warrior statue is composed of LEGO bricks, as indicated by the visible interlocking structure and distinct LEGO elements that form its body, limbs, and head. LEGO bricks are characterized by their block-like appearance and interlocking design, distinct in this image, marking the sculpture as made entirely of such material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the primary colors used in the statue limited to shades of brown and tan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the statue using a combination of brown for the armor and yellow for the body parts such as the arms and legs. While brown and tan are present, yellow is a significant addition, indicating that the primary colors are not limited solely to shades of brown and tan.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armor sections (such as chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards) made of smooth LEGO bricks without surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor sections in Image B are constructed using LEGO bricks that typically do not have any surface texture like carved wood, appearing smooth with the characteristic flat finish seen in standard LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental details such as the headdress, necklace, and carvings on the torso created using textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the ornamental details including the headdress and necklace seem to rely on the shape and configuration of LEGO bricks rather than any inherent texture or pattern on the bricks themselves, thus lacking visible textured patterns that imitate carved detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO statue positioned on a plain white pedestal with no decorative elements, located in a gallery environment with framed artworks on the walls and track lighting overhead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the LEGO statue on a plain white pedestal in a minimally decorated gallery space. Unlike Image A, which displays artworks on the walls, Image B depicts an empty wall space without additional decoration, and lacks visible gallery elements like track lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO statue retain the same standing posture, facial expression, and proportional dimensions as the original wooden warrior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the LEGO statue in Image B retains the standing posture and proportional dimensions consistent with the original wooden warrior shown in Image A. The posture is identical, although facial features are blurred, but proportions remain aligned.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the statue visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, with no continuous surfaces resembling carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the statue constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, where each piece is identifiable as separate LEGO parts, unlike carved wood, which would present continuous carved surfaces. The absence of wood-like finish supports that it is made of LEGO bricks.",
