      "question": "Is the entire cat composed of crystal materials with no visible fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat appears to be a sculpture or figurine made entirely from crystal-like materials. The surface is smooth and faceted, common characteristics of crystal, with no visible texture typical of fur found in real cats or represented in illustrative art. Therefore, analyzing visual cues, it can be concluded that the cat is composed of crystal materials without fur.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body parts of the cat constructed primarily from clear and smoky quartz crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat made from materials resembling crystals with a transparent or translucent quality. The variations in shade and tone suggest the use of clear and smoky quartz crystals, which exhibit similar properties. Thus, visual observation combined with material knowledge leads to the conclusion that clear and smoky quartz materials could be used.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are brown and black obsidian accents used to represent the calico pattern on the cat’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The darker areas on Image B’s cat could reasonably be interpreted as representing black or dark material, with a shine and a smooth surface, characteristics found in obsidian. Observing these visual cues alongside knowledge of obsidian properties supports the conclusion brown and black accents are used for the calico pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the cat’s eyes crafted from vibrant green emerald crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are depicted as bright and vivid green, with a sharp liveliness consistent with the appearance of emerald crystals. Visual characteristics such as brightness and color vibrancy align well with emeralds, leading to the inference that the eyes could be crafted from emerald crystals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cat seated on a plain, polished wooden block with no added decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the cat atop a block that appears to be wood, smooth and polished with visible grain patterns, characteristic of wood. There are no visible additional decorations or embellishments on the block, confirming it as plain and polished.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the wooden block appear natural and polished, providing a clear contrast to the crystalline cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden block has a natural appearance with clear wood grain, suggesting proper finishing. The contrast in texture and material between the polished wooden block and the faceted crystal composition of the cat creates a distinct visual contrast, highlighting the cat’s materials further.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the cat maintained its original seated posture with paws forward and tail curved behind?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cat retains a posture where its paws are positioned forward, and its tail curves around at the base. This matches the typical seated stance evident in Image A. Comparative observation confirms that the posture has been maintained in the transition to Image B.",
