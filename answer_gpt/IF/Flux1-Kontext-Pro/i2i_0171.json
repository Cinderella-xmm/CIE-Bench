      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the skier's exact pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurines are presented in a similar skiing position as shown in Image A. The skier in Image A is bending their knees and leaning into a skiing posture, which is mirrored by the figurines in Image B. However, the angles or specific hand positions may not be exactly identical, but they are very close. Figurines are typically designed to capture the essence of a pose rather than being exact replicas.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a separate pair of skis included in the packaging, which suggests that the skis are detachable. This is a common practice for toy figurine designs, where accessories are often removable or interchangeable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging mentions a 'MAGNETIC FOU.. SCOFTSRE BASE,' which indicates that there is a base that the figurines can be attached to, likely magnetically. Such bases are often used for stability and display purposes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the skier or figurine is equipped with ski poles and a backpack. Thus, the figurine in Image B accurately includes these details as they were indeed part of the skier's setup in Image A.",
