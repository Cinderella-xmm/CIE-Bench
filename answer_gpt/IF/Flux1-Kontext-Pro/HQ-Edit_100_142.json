        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire composition exhibits visible, textured brushstrokes.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject's clothing in Image B is shown with thick, visible brushstrokes that emphasize the vibrancy and texture of the colors and patterns.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
