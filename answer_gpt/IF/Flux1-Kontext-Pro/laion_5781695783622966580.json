      "question": "Does the hat feature distinct geometric patterns such as zigzags, chevrons, or stepped lines typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat has prominent geometric patterns, including zigzags and possibly chevrons, which align with the Art Deco style known for such motifs. Recognizing these patterns requires understanding that Art Deco often uses bold geometric shapes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B shows gold-colored accents along the brim and edges, providing a decorative touch that complements the geometric pattern of the hat.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns in Image B appear to be symmetrically distributed across the hat, as Art Deco style often involves balanced and symmetric use of motifs. The alignment of geometric lines on the crown and brim supports this symmetry.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat's patterns in Image B do not seem to follow the wave of the hair but rather provide a contrast in terms of orderly lines against the natural flow of the hair.",
