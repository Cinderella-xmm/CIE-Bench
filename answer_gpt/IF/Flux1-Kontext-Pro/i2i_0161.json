        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title “Catch the Wave” is present in large white letters towards the top of the image, directly above the visible horizon line formed by the meeting of sea and sky. The placement above the horizon is distinct, as the text is situated in the sky area above where the ocean waves are visible.",

      ],

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title “Catch the Wave” is displayed in large, bold white letters at the top, contrasting notably in size against the smaller text in the bottom-left corner which reads “Summer Adventures – 2025”.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the note in the bottom-left corner clearly states “Summer Adventures – 2025”. The inclusion of a dash and the year “2025” is explicit in the text, confirming that the year is a part of the overall note.",
