      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame. The wooden borders are prominently visible around the painted scene, which is a characteristic feature of shadow boxes used to create a confined, framed environment for artworks or displays. This conclusion is drawn from the wooden frame's obvious presence, which sets boundaries for the scene, differentiating it from Image A which lacks any such framing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the tree been scaled down in size and rendered with enhanced 3D surface texture (e.g., visible bark details, depth, shading)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree appears smaller compared to its depiction in Image A. The scale of the tree has been reduced due to its placement within the wooden shadow box. However, the level of detail regarding 3D surface texture, such as enhanced bark details, is not more pronounced in Image B than Image A. The tree in Image B is painted and maintains a similar aesthetic to Image A without visible enhancement in texture. The shadow box format indicates a change in scale, but not necessarily in textural detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers (e.g., pink, yellow, blue, red) beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visibly features distinct patches of multi-colored flowers beneath the tree, including pink, yellow, blue, and red hues. These patches are similar to the arrangement in Image A, where colorful flowers are clearly recognizable in the foreground. The presence of these flowers contributes significantly to the visual interest of the scene both within and outside the shadow box. The vivid portrayal of multiple flower colors confirms the presence in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background consist of multiple layered painted surfaces that create a sense of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears flat in relation to the overall scene. While the painted surfaces depict depth through artistry, such as perspective and color gradients to simulate distance, the physical composition within the shadow box is more two-dimensional with no actual layered physical depth. The painted surfaces do contribute to depth perception, similar to Image A, but the shadow box limits physical dimensional layering.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires above or within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires above the scene, which are clearly noticeable due to their positioning and attachment evident in the shadow box setup. These clouds add a novel, playful element, revealing techniques from diorama or model setups. This contrasts with Image A where clouds naturally float without physical suspension, highlighting an artificial aspect in Image B that involves external props.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image include surreal or stylized elements (e.g., floating clouds, soft glow, pastel hues) that contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains surreal and stylized elements such as floating clouds held by wires, enhancing a whimsical atmosphere. The overall composition uses bright, pastel-like hues and an idealized depiction of nature, akin to Image A where the scene is naturally stylized with a soft glow and rich color palette. These elements contribute strongly to a dreamlike ambiance in both images, though shadow box adds an additional playful dimension.",
