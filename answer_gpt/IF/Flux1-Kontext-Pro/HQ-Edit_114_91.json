      "question": "Has the anvil and hammer been transformed into a single cohesive enchanted forest guardian creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil and hammer have undergone a transformation that combines natural forest elements and mystical features, forming a cohesive structure that appears to be an enchanted creature. The hammerhead has become an owl-like face, and the body resembles a tree trunk with roots, suggesting a guardian-like presence. This transformation aligns with the concept of an enchanted forest creature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the previously rusted surfaces of the anvil and hammer now covered in moss-like textures and crawling ivy tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of both the anvil and hammer exhibit a rich layer of moss, giving them a natural texture. Ivy tendrils appear to be intertwined across the surfaces, enhancing the organic transformation, which contrasts with the rusty appearance in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the hammerhead been morphed into an owl-like face with visible ivy forming the eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hammerhead in Image B clearly resembles an owl face, with the top of the hammer forming two ear-like tufts. The eyes of the owl are bright green, likely formed by skillful manipulation of ivy and moss textures, enhancing the owl-like appearance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
