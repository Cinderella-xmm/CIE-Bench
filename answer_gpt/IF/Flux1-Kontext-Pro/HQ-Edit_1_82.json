        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the picture clearly displays three separate panels placed adjacent to each other within a single frame. Each panel contains an image of a gymnast performing on a balance beam, and they are housed within a frame that segments the overall display into three distinct sections. This setup is common for showcasing a series of related images in a single view.",

      "question": "Are the gymnasts depicted in a semi-realistic cartoon style, with stylized features but retaining human proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnasts are portrayed with proportions that are true to human bodies, suggesting a realistic representation. Their features, movements, and details are consistent with how gymnasts appear in reality rather than a stylized or cartoonish interpretation. This indicates that the depiction leans more toward realism than a semi-realistic cartoon style.",

      "question": "Do the gymnasts' outfits feature flowy designs that suggest movement, such as draping or trailing fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outfits of the gymnasts in Image B are fitted leotards, which are typical for gymnastics as they allow ease of movement without any excess, flowing fabric. There are no elements such as draping or trailing fabric that would suggest a flowy design. The design is more functional and sleek, fitting tightly to the athletes' bodies.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors include vibrant blues, whites, and other bright shades that appear in the outfits and the arena background. Earthy tones like browns, greens, or warm neutrals are not prevalent in this image. Instead, the scene is designed to emphasize contrast and lighting effects common in professional sports arenas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gymnasts' outfits in Image B have a design that includes linear or abstract motifs. However, there is no indication of sequins or sparkly materials that typically catch light and create reflective effects. The design seems more printed than textured, lacking the distinctive shine that sequined outfits would have.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
