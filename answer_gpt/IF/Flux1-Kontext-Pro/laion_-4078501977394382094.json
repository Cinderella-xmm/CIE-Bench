      "question": "Is the title \"Desert Adventure Chronicles\" displayed at the top or in a prominent location of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout consists of multiple comic panels, and I observe that there is no visible title 'Desert Adventure Chronicles' prominently displayed at the top or any other notable location within the image. The panels are focused on visual storytelling with dialogue bubbles, without an overarching title.",

      "question": "Are there exactly three separate panels arranged horizontally or vertically in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of four panels arranged in a 2x2 grid format, meaning there are four separate panels, not three. Therefore, the panels are neither arranged purely horizontally nor vertically, but in a combination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the green van's roof is illustrated in a conventional manner with a luggage rack on top, similar to a typical van roof. There is no visual indication or styling to suggest that the roof is tilted upward resembling a hat tip.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text bubble in Panel 1 of Image B contains the phrase 'Ah the open road calles!', which is visible. However, the word 'calles' is misspelled; it should be 'calls'. Therefore, the text is not correctly spelled.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the van does not exhibit headlights that appear significantly wider or brighter than those in other panels. The focus appears to be on the interaction with the cactus rather than the depiction of surprise through the headlights.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B shows a cactus on the roof of the van, but it does not morph into a fountain-like structure with water spraying or flowing from it. The cactus remains static and does not transform into a water-emitting feature.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, the van is not depicted splashing water with visible droplets or ripples. The van is parked in a desert scenery without any nearby body of water. The depiction primarily contains desert elements, not aquatic features.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 3 of Image B depicts green vegetation, including plants and possibly a palm tree, surrounding the area, which suggests the presence of an oasis with greenery typical of such scenes in desert environments, confirming the visibility of green plants/trees.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout of Image B is a 2x2 grid of panels, making the image roughly square rather than elongated. This configuration does not lend itself to the image width being exactly three times its height; the proportions do not match such a ratio.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images A and B showcase consistent use of warm, pastel-like colors and a cartoonish, vibrant art style with exaggerated features and whimsy synonymous with whimsical adventure themes often depicted in cartoon art. Comparing the style between both images, Image B matches the distinctive color palette and whimsical art style presented in Image A.",
