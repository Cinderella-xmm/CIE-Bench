        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show that the entire scene, which includes the parrot, is enclosed within a glass dome. The reflective surface and transparency of the material are indicative of glass, enclosing the scenery.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parrot in Image B maintains realistic proportions and details, with its head and body in natural proportion to each other. This indicates that it is not depicted in a chibi style, which typically features exaggeratedly large heads.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves surrounding the parrot appear to be in proportion to the parrot, which itself is in realistic proportions. The vibrancy of their color is not unusually exaggerated. Therefore, they are not significantly larger than a normal scale.",
