      "question": "Have the shoes been increased in size while keeping their original design intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear slightly larger compared to typical proportions but maintain the overall color scheme and design details such as laces and panels similar to Image A, suggesting a possible increase in size. The shoes in Image B have chunky soles that are visually distinctive, but their basic structural design remains unchanged from Image A. The visual cues indicate that the shoes adhere to the general style seen in Image A with potential adjustments in dimension.",

      "question": "Do the legs appear more cartoon-like compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are shown with realistic features such as color, texture, and crease details typical of a photograph, lacking any exaggerated or stylized elements commonly associated with cartoon-like representations. Comparing this to Image A, where the legs are illustrated with simplified colors and smooth surfaces consistent with cartoon art style, we see a clear shift towards a more realistic depiction in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the feet placed on a shelf shaped like clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet are positioned on a flat, solid surface resembling a shelf rather than on any fluffy or irregularly shaped object. This can be contrasted with Image A, where the feet are creatively illustrated to walk on clouds, meaning Image B demonstrates a more conventional placement on a defined shelf without cloud-shaped formations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall appearance of the legs and shoes reflect a bobblehead-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the legs and shoes maintain proportional realism without exaggerated features or disproportion typically associated with bobblehead-style transformations. The shoes may appear slightly larger, but the legs themselves are realistic, not mimicking the cartoon proportions often found in bobblehead figures. Image A presents an artistic depiction, but both images maintain reasonable proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shoes still maintain their original design details after being resized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes preserve their defining elements such as the color palette, panel arrangements, laces, and sole style similar to Image A, even if there is a perceived increase in size. All these components are crucial to the original design seen in Image A, demonstrating that the shoes have retained their foundational design despite potential changes in dimension.",
