      "question": "Does the edited image feature a halftone pattern with dots creating shades and gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a halftone effect, characterized by dots of varying sizes that create different shades and gradients throughout the image. This technique is commonly used in print media to simulate continuous-tone imagery through the use of dots, varying either in size, shape, or spacing. In Image B, the soccer ball and the net in the goalpost specifically reveal this halftone technique, where smaller and denser dots mimic shades and gradients, which is indicative of a halftone pattern.",

      "question": "Are there vivid contrasts between the colors and elements in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image is primarily monochromatic, featuring shades of black, white, and gradients produced by the halftone dots. This results in less vivid contrast compared to an image with a broader and more saturated color palette. The contrast in Image B is more about the difference in shades due to the halftone effect, not vivid contrasting colors. Thus, while the elements such as the soccer ball and the goalpost are distinguishable, they do not exhibit vivid color contrasts.",

      "question": "Do the soccer ball and goalpost in the edited image have sharp, well-defined edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, employs a halftone pattern and style that typically does not produce sharp, well-defined edges but rather includes blurriness introduced by the dot pattern that creates a gradient look as an artistic choice. This results in softer edges compared to straightforward vector graphics or photographic sharpness. While the forms are clear and recognizable, the edges are not sharply defined due to the halftone printing approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the soccer ball and goalpost been simplified into bold, graphic forms while remaining recognizable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball and goalpost have been simplified into bold forms using a halftone technique, which provides a graphic and stylized look. This style reduces detail complexity but retains enough of the fundamental shapes and features to make the objects clearly recognizable. The use of strong contrasts between light and dark regions helps maintain recognition despite the simplification.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall visual effect of the edited image striking, with a vibrant appearance and dynamic composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The halftone style applied in Image B along with the sparkles around the goalpost creates a visually striking effect due to the use of bold black and white contrasts and the dotted texture pattern. However, the term 'vibrant' typically suggests a lively appearance produced by bright colors, which is absent here due to the monochromatic scheme of black and white. Hence, while the composition is dynamic and stark, it does not fit the vibrant criterion associated with vivid colors.",
