    "Question": "Q1: Is the McLaren depicted as a highly detailed 3D-rendered model rather than a photographic image?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the McLaren appears detailed and encased in a display, suggesting it might be a model. The controlled lighting and flawless surface can indicate a 3D-rendered model. However, common sense and the context of being in a display case suggest it's a highly detailed physical model with realistic features photographed, rather than CGI. Compared to Image A, which shows the car in a showroom, Image B's setting implies a model car scenario.",
