    "Question": "Q1: Are the horse and elephant depicted as chibi-style 3D models?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse and elephant appear simplified and stylized, characteristic of chibi-style models which often feature exaggerated and cute features. The proportions and exaggerated aspects, such as a smooth, almost cartoonish surface give them a 3D model look that aligns with common chibi-style representations.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the horse and elephant rendered as 3D models?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse and elephant have a smooth, sculpted appearance typical of 3D rendering. Their lack of texture detail and uniformity in shape and surface finish indicates that they are depicted as 3D models rather than photographs. This aligns with the typical characteristics of rendered 3D models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
