      "question": "Are the flowers in the image rendered with visibly higher color saturation compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers exhibit vibrant colors, suggesting a high level of color saturation. Compared to Image A, which has a more natural, possibly slightly muted color scheme, the colors in Image B are more intense and saturated. By using common knowledge about digital editing, higher saturation levels make colors appear more vivid and pronounced.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a decorative vine pattern visible in the border area, adding a subtle overlay to the image.
