    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a flat postcard format rather than a 3D product shot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is depicted on a piece of paper set against a flat background, suggesting a postcard or card format. This differs from a typical 3D product shot which would display the object with spatial depth and perspective indicating its real-life dimensionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the main features of the bag rendered in minimalist line art style with clean, simplified outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not demonstrate minimalist line art; the bag retains its detailed visual features including textures and shading, rather than simplified lines. This design approach shows depth and detail reminiscent of photographic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chevron pattern visually enhanced to appear raised or embossed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chevron pattern of the bag maintains its appearance from Image A, showing detailed lines and shadows that suggest texture but not explicitly embossing or raising. This indicates that there is no enhancement to depict embossing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gold zippers depicted with a raised or embossed effect, distinct from the surrounding surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the zippers with consistent visual texture and lighting similar to Image A, but without additional effects to suggest embossing or raising. The zippers appear integrated into the surface of the bag.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a muted olive tone palette without vibrant or contrasting colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the olive-colored bag and the black portfolio in the background, displaying a generally muted palette. There are no additional contrasting or vibrant colors present beyond the subtle gold highlights.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image include a blank area on the back of the postcard suitable for writing messages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays not only the front but seemingly includes a back section with dashed lines indicating space. This suggests a typical postcard where one side is blank for writing, positioned behind the image of the bag.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the postcard displayed inside a sleek black portfolio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcard featuring the bag is prominently set against the backdrop of an open black portfolio, in contrast to Image A which does not have such a surrounding or context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the interior pages of the portfolio ivory in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows parts of the portfolio comparing contrastive colors â€” the inner pages reflect a lighter shade indicative of ivory, as distinct from the black outer portfolio. This difference is discernible through the color contrast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
