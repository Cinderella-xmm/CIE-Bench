      "question": "Does the kite have a design that resembles or suggests it could be made as a paper craft model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kites appear flat and are clearly constructed from a material resembling paper. The folded shapes and visible creases indicate paper construction or origami-like craftsmanship. The kites are shown on what seems to be flat sheets of paper, supporting the idea that they are crafted as paper models. Such visual information, combined with the knowledge that paper is a common medium for simple kite models, suggests that this kite design is intended as a paper craft.",

      "question": "Are the colors used for the kite vibrant and suitable for representing cultural significance on a postcard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kites are depicted in a bright yellow color. Yellow is often a vibrant and attention-grabbing color, frequently used in cultural symbols and artistic representations due to its brightness and visibility. It can invoke feelings of joy, warmth, and positivity, making it an excellent choice for a culturally significant image on a postcard. The vividness of the yellow contrasts well with the blue sky background, further enhancing its appeal for such uses.",

      "question": "Is the kite prominently featured in the image, with minimal distracting elements around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kites are central to the composition and are presented on a plain background. The surrounding area is quite minimalistic, focusing the viewer's attention primarily on the kites themselves. The imageâ€™s overall layout prioritizes the kites, making them the main focus and minimizing distractions. This clear and uncluttered presentation suggests that the kites are the prominent and central feature of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the structural details of the kite, such as its frame and tail, well-defined and clear enough to suggest it could be crafted from paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kites in Image B show visible seams and folds that are typical of paper crafts. The edges and corners are sharp and well-defined, indicating that they are made from a material easy to crease and fold, like paper. The tail, also made of the same material, drapes naturally, suggesting the lightweight quality typical of paper. These clear features support that the kite is designed to be made from paper, with structural details that are well-defined.",
