      "question": "Are there exactly four distinct bookmark-shaped objects in the edited image, each resembling one of the skyscrapers from the original cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, four bookmark-shaped objects are visible, each resembling a skyscraper with specific architectural details. They appear to mimic urban structures. By comparing with Image A, the objects share a visual resemblance with skyscrapers but they are identical in shape, not distinct. Thus, there arenâ€™t distinct bookmarks each similar to different skyscrapers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the four bookmarks exhibit a metallic sheen and are they primarily colored in shimmering gold and silver hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bookmarks with a metallic sheen, clearly reflecting light in a way typical of metallic objects. They seem to be silver in color, showing variations in reflection but not gold shimmer, so they aren't primarily gold and silver.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bookmarks have clearly etched, lively, and stylized outlines that give them a cartoon-like appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays bookmarks with etched details that depict a cityscape in a stylized manner. The outlines are prominent and artistic, yet the overall appeal is more formal and decorative rather than cartoon-like.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there an open book in the image with the four bookmarks clipped onto its pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmarks are placed directly on a notebook's pages, but they aren't clipped onto the pages as typical bookmarks would be; they're merely set on top of the pages.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible doodles of stars and waves on the pages of the open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features visible hand-drawn designs next to the bookmarks, consisting of stars and flowing lines resembling waves which are evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do each of the four bookmarks retain the distinctive architectural silhouette of a different skyscraper from the original cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bookmarks all share the same silhouette, indicating uniformity and lack of distinction among the architectural styles. While they all potentially represent skyscrapers, they don't reflect different structures from Image A.",
