      "question": "Does the image have a white border frame surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct, evenly-colored white frame visible around the image. This visual characteristic matches the common appearance of a white border frame, often associated with Polaroid-style photographs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a handwritten caption at the bottom of the image that reads “Banana Cream Dream 2024”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom area inside the white frame, the words 'Banana Cream Dream 2024' appear in a font that mimics handwriting. This is a typical visual presentation for captions on Polaroid-style images, where personal annotations are added below the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit a light brown vintage filter that gives the appearance of a film-style photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an overall color tone that is subdued with a warm, slightly brownish hue. This effect is consistent with applying a vintage filter that mimics the coloration of old film-style photographs, which often have a slightly faded and warm appearance due to aging.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the image presented in a Polaroid style with the combination of the white border frame and vintage filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines a white border frame and a vintage filter, both of which are characteristic features of Polaroid-style images. This stylization is typical for recreating a retro photographic look, indicating the image indeed adopts a Polaroid presentation style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the original dessert appearance been preserved without any changes apart from the added frame, caption, and filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the dessert's appearance in both Image A and Image B, there are no visible changes to the composition or arrangement of the dessert elements such as the banana slices, whipped cream, or cheesecake. The additions such as the white frame, caption, and vintage filter are external to the subject itself, suggesting the dessert's appearance remains unaltered.",
