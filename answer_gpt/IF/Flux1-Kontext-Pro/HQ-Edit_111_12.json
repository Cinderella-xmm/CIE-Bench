      "question": "Are the knitting needles visibly larger than their original size in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles appear to be of a size that is consistent with realistic knitting needles. By examining the context and considering their proportional size to the woman's hands, they do not appear exaggeratedly large compared to what is typical for knitting. Without comparison to Image A, there is no indication of enlargement beyond a reasonable size.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cup is depicted with clearly visible swirling lines above it. These lines are often used in illustrations to suggest steam, indicating the presence of a hot beverage in the cup. In cartoon or stylized forms, such steam is often exaggerated for effect.",
