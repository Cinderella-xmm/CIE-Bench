      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a black-and-white, textured style that resembles monochrome or grayscale rendering. The absence of color and the shading technique create a classic, illustrative look, highlighting tonal variations and details without using different colors.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides the event name 'Riders & Reins Expo 2024' and location 'Evergreen Equestrian Center, Olympia, WA.' However, the date details are shown differently, with 'September, 2024, 10:00 AM - 10:36:00 PM' rather than the exact Saturday and time frame mentioned in the question.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's layout appears to be a standard poster format, given the arrangement and how the visual fills the space. However, it's unclear if this corresponds precisely to standard letter-sized portrait orientation without direct reference to dimensions or scale.",
