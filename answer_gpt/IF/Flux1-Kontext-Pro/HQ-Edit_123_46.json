      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the basketball player depicted in a mid-dribble pose with the ball near the ground and body in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player is shown in a dynamic dribbling pose, holding the ball close to his knees while seemingly in motion.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a distinct comic or graphic novel style with bold black outlines around the basketball player, the ball, hoop, and other elements. These outlines are a common technique used in pop art to differentiate and highlight main subjects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dynamic action is emphasized through the use of sharp lines radiating from the player, which is a storytelling technique to suggest speed or motion. Such lines are often used in graphic arts to visually suggest movement.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes text overlaid at the bottom of the image in a bold, stylized retro font that complements the comic panel aesthetic, but the text does not suggest a fictional game title; instead, it reads 'STUΛH'.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image have a distinct comic panel border (e.g., a thick frame with possible decorative corners) surrounding it?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is framed with a thick border typical of comic panels, creating a distinct delineation that suggests a story or scene within a larger visual narrative. The use of the border enhances the comic-book style presentation.",
