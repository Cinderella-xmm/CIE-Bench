      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky appears to have an artificial appearance characterized by a soft, uniform surface texture and simplified features typical of a plush toy. The proportions and facial expressions also suggest a toy rather than a real animal. Combining this observation with common knowledge of toy design, it's clear that Image B showcases a plush toy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky's paws are stylized and much larger relative to its body than what would be typically seen in a real husky. This exaggeration is consistent with plush toy designs, where emphasis is often placed on cuteness and disproportionate features. Hence, based on this analysis, the paws are indeed exaggerated compared to a real husky's.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows fur that is smooth and consistent, lacking the natural variability evident in Image A's depiction of a real husky's fur. The texture in Image B aligns with that of fabric used in plush toys, providing a velvety, soft appearance typical of such manufactured products.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and facial features are simpler and appear embroidered or stitched, as is common with plush toys. In contrast to Image A’s depiction of realistic eyes and face details, Image B's husky has stylized elements typical of fabric toys. This suggests its facial features lack realism.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the husky positioned on a wooden surface, characterized by defined edges and uniform texture typical of shelving units. This setup is consistent with how toys are often presented or stored, confirming a shelf environment in distinct contrast to the snowy landscape of Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background minimalist, without any natural elements like snow, trees, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a simplistic and confined setting—a wooden shelf in contrast to Image A’s natural snow-covered environment with trees and sky. This contributes to a minimalist, indoor setting devoid of external or natural elements.",
