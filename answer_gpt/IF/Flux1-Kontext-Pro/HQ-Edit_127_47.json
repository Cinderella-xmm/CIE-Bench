      "question": "Is the entire forest lake scene enclosed within a visible spherical glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly exhibits the forest lake scene encapsulated within a spherical glass orb. This is visually identifiable through the curvature and reflection properties of the glass that distorts the scenery, a common characteristic of objects within a spherical glass. The visual effect of the orb separates the scene from its surrounding, confirming its enclosure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks appear shiny and reflective, indicative of 3D models with a glossy finish. They resemble rubber duck style models rather than living creatures, marked by their uniform yellow color and simplified features, which differentiate them from the more natural appearance of the ducks in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the water with a clear, enhanced depth and clarity, resembling resin-like textures. The layered appearance and transparency suggest the presence of materials or rendering techniques that mimic these qualities, unlike the more natural appearance of water in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there visible miniature figurines of woodland animals placed among the rocks and vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small figurines of woodland animals placed amidst the rocks at the base of the scene within the orb. These figurines are recognizable by their small size and distinct shapes, which stand out from the natural elements, indicating they are artificial additions to the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass orb in Image B is depicted as a wooden stand with visible wood grain textures. This indicates a natural wood material, characterized by its smooth and organic appearance typical of wooden objects.",
