      "question": "Has the background been changed from a sunset to a starry night sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a night sky with visible stars and a large moon, suggesting the setting is at night. A sunset typically displays warm, golden hues and a visible sun as seen in Image A. Given this stark difference, it's accurate to say the background has changed from a sunset to a starry night sky.",

      "question": "Is there a faint new moon visible in the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a large, bright full moon visible in the sky which is characteristic of a full moon, not a faint new moon. A new moon appears as a thin crescent or is nearly invisible. Hence, the moon seen here is not faint and does not match the characteristics of a new moon.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image include subtle dreamy effects such as soft lighting or faint clouds to create a dreamy atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clear night sky filled with stars and a bright full moon, which contributes to a serene ambiance. Although the starry sky adds a certain dreaminess, there aren't additional obvious dreamy effects like soft lighting or faint clouds in the image. Therefore, the transition from the sunset to the night sky alone doesn't create pronounced dreamy effects beyond the natural allure of a starry night.",

    {

      "question": "Have the birds remained in their original positions and retained their detailed appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the birds appear in the same positions as in Image A, with their detailed features such as plumage and posture intact. This suggests that their placements and appearances have not been altered in the editing process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any additional changes to the image apart from the background, new moon, and dreamy effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No\n```",
      "explanation": "Aside from the clearly altered background shifting from a sunset to a starry sky, and the inclusion of a prominent moon, no other alterations are evident in Image B. The birds and foliage maintain their original placement and appearance, and no additional objects or effects are introduced. Hence, no other changes seem present apart from the big background change and the introduced moon.",
