    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the snowy mountain peaks visibly reshaped into jagged, wing-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the mountains in the background, they retain their typical snow-covered, triangular peaks, similar to those in Image A, showing no transformation into jagged or wing-like structures. Visual cues and common understanding of mountain landscapes do not indicate any manipulation for a wing-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the foreground lake display a pattern of reflective, scale-like textures across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the lake appears to have a smooth reflective surface typical of calm water bodies and doesn't depict any unusual scale-like texture. This aligns with common knowledge about water reflections, especially under clear skies, wherein no such textured patterns are naturally expected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the winding peninsula reshaped into a long, curving, sinewy tail structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no obvious transformation of the landforms into a tail-like structure. The original shape of the land in Image A still resembles a peninsula rather than a sinewy tail in the edited image, consistent with the original geographical layout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant houses reconfigured into a continuous, segmented metallic spine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The houses in the background of Image B appear typical and remain distinct as houses, without modification into a metallic spine-like formation. A typical arrangement of distant houses is visible. From common structural elements, no transformation akin to a segmented spine is evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there distinct, swirling cloud formations in the sky that resemble eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s sky contains clouds that maintain typical forms without distinct alterations into eye-like swirling formations. The clouds appear natural and scattered, consistent with common atmospheric conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the grassland area show directional, windswept textures resembling fur covering the creature’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassland textures in Image B display characteristics typical of natural landscapes, such as uneven patches and variations in color, but do not exhibit any distinct directional or fur-like texturing. A creature-like analysis doesn't match the visual data.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all modified elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, eyes, fur) integrate seamlessly into a single, coherent mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, it features a mythical creature standing on the water, but the elements that should be a coherent mythical beast (wings, scales, etc.) have not been extraneously reshaped across the landscape. The creature in the image is isolated from these features and does not integrate with potential modifications of the natural scenery into one single beast, unlike the separate fantastical creature seen.",
