      "question": "Does the butterfly have its antennae positioned or depicted in a way that suggests motion resembling a conductor's baton?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's antennae are positioned upright and somewhat extended outward. This positioning can give the impression of conducting or guiding as a conductor's baton, suggesting motion due to their straight and focused orientation. These visual cues combine with the concept of 'Symphony' in the image title, which implies a musical theme, thus reinforcing the idea of conducting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there faint sheet music patterns, such as musical notes or staff lines, visible within the orange areas of the butterfly’s wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible musical notes or staff lines within the orange areas of the butterfly's wings. The wings display consistent patterns typical of monarch butterflies without incorporating any musical elements in the design. This lack of musical patterns indicates that the edited image does not feature faint sheet music patterns on the wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flowers around the butterfly have petals shaped like musical notes or arranged in a way that suggests rhythmic swaying?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are musical notes in the background, especially around the flowers, the petals themselves retain natural shapes and are not distinctively shaped like musical notes. The arrangement of the flowers does not specifically suggest rhythmic swaying through their form. Therefore, the flowers do not have petals mimicking musical note shapes nor an arrangement that suggests rhythm.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the flowers rendered in soft, pastel color tones rather than vivid or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B are depicted in various soft shades, such as pinks, oranges, and yellows, which are gentle and more pastel-like, as opposed to highly saturated, bright tones. These colors contribute to the overall dreamy quality of the image and align with the pastel depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'Monarch’s Garden Symphony' in Image B is presented in a script font characterized by flowing curves and elegant strokes. This style often conveys sophistication and aligns with themes of melody found in symphonies, matching the concept of the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a circular or semi-circular layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is centrally positioned, surrounded by flowers that form an encompassing semi-circular layout around it. This arrangement creates a harmonious framing effect typical of artistic design focusing on balance and centrality. Additional elements, like the musical notes around, help emphasize this pattern of arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears more rectangular than square, as evidenced by the positioning of elements and the background layout. The display does not support equal width and height, which would characterize a square format; it seems intended for cover or poster display, typically not square.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes soft lighting and gentle shadows, evident by the illumination and shading around the butterfly and flowers. Musical notes and clouds with subtle color gradients contribute to a serene ambience, crafting a harmonious and dreamy atmosphere that aligns with the thematic title and overall effect of the presentation.",
