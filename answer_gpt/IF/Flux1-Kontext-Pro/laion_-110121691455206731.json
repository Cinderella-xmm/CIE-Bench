      "question": "Is the edited image a comic strip consisting of at least two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are visual separations that distinctly divide the overall image into four parts, each with its own unique visual and textual elements. This multi-panel format is characteristic of a comic strip, which often uses separate panels to convey a sequence of events or different scenes.",

      "question": "Does Panel 1 show the watch with a face drawn on its dial, seated at a detective desk, and polishing its metal exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 depicts a detective character at a desk, with a thought bubble suggesting detective work. However, the watch itself, appearing in Panel 2, does not display a face drawn on its dial in this panel. Panel 1 does not show the watch in a seated position or performing any action such as polishing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text dialogue in Panel 1 actually reads 'Time to solve this case bel the last second ‚ù§Ô∏è', which is slightly different from the provided dialogue option and does not include the detective emoji.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 displays a watch on the desk, not showing a cluttered office or a character examining a magnifying glass. The scene is more focused on the watch and does not include these elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are no visible textual sound effects such as 'tick' or 'tock' around the watch dial in any of the panels. The panels focus on dialogues and images, without adding sound effects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image utilizes greyscale predominantly, with particular attention to shading and highlights to provide the impression of shiny silver accents, mirroring the original watch's metallic appearance. This visual technique is characteristic of portraying metal objects, such as watches, with a realistic shine.",
      "weight": 1,

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the depiction in the panels, the watch dial in the comic does not exhibit a cartoonish facial expression. The focus is on illustrating the watch's features, aligning with its original appearance, rather than adding animated facial characteristics.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 contains similar dialogue but it states, 'No detail too small to tthe last second,' followed by 'No detail too small for Detective ‚ù§Ô∏è'. Both sections don't match the provided exact text and emoji, thus differing from the given dialogue.",
