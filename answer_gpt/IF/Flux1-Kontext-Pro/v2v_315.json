      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman appears in a 3D chibi style, characterized by exaggerated and cute proportions such as a larger head compared to the body, giving a cartoonish and adorable appearance typical of the chibi style.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman adopts a pose with her hand on her waist, standing straight and facing the echidna, gestures that denote confidence and assurance. This posture is commonly used to convey confidence in character portrayal, which is evident in the chibi-style depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The environment in Image B does not maintain a realistic look, instead possessing a stylized and slightly cartoonish aesthetic consistent with the 3D chibi style.
