      "question": "Does the edited image display a visual texture consistent with satin paper, including a soft sheen and slight reflectivity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the photograph is presented in a way that mimics the appearance of a printed page. The surface appears to have a matte finish typical of a satin paper, as there's a noticeable soft sheen and slight reflectivity which emits a gentle luster under lighting. This quality is consistent with prints on satin paper which is known for its subdued gloss compared to glossy papers, while still maintaining some reflective properties.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the suit rendered with visible watercolor effects, showing blended blue-black hues and soft, painterly edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit appears less sharp and exhibits a texture that mimics the look of watercolor paint. The hues of blue-black are blended together with softer edges, creating a painterly effect rather than a precise photographic one. Such effects simulate the characteristics of watercolor paintings where distinct, sharp lines are often absent, and colors merge softly with hints of granulation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible golden pinstripes running vertically along the suit jacket, consistent with the watercolor aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no vertical golden pinstripes are visible on the suit jacket; the jacket appears to be a solid color consistent with the watercolor effect theme. The lack of pinstripes maintains the aesthetic continuity with the rest of the painterly appearance, emphasizing blended hues rather than distinct, thin lines that pinstripes would imply.",

      "question": "Are there at least two different tie patterns visible across the images in the series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several ties depicted on the album page, each exhibiting a different pattern. There is a variety of designs such as checks and diagonal stripes shown in different sections of the image, providing clear evidence that at least two different tie patterns are present in the series.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a leather-bound album frame featuring an embossed title, with visible texture and depth suggesting real leather and raised lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the page does appear to be set inside a bound album, yet there is no visible embossed title on the album frame, nor is there sufficient evidence suggesting details like real leather or raised lettering. The focus is more on the texture of the page itself rather than providing detailed insights into the album's material or embossing.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit rich textures (such as satin, leather, or watercolor brushwork) and a refined, timeless composition that conveys classic elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a variety of textures and effects that collectively contribute to an air of classic elegance. The watercolor effect gives artistically blended features, and the depiction of the image as part of an album introduces a nostalgic, refined presentation. The combination of soft sheen, painterly suit texture, and the neatly arranged tie patterns imbue the image with a refined and timeless visual appeal.",
