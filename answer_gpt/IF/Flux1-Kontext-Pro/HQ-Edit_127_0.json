      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top center of the image, there is a distinct and legible title 'The Nocturnal Observer's Guide'. The font is large and placed prominently for clear visibility, which is typical for an illustration aiming to convey a specific theme or subject. This format helps signal to the viewer what the content of the image pertains to.",

      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding foliage display lush, highly detailed botanical features consistent with a scientific illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree and foliage in Image B are drawn with considerable detail, showcasing intricate leaves and branches that align with the stylistic elements of botanical and scientific illustrations, which often emphasize realism and accuracy in depicting nature.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image dominated by earthy tones, particularly highlighting the owl’s brown and cream plumage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is predominantly earthy, featuring browns and creams that draw attention specifically to the owl's plumage. Such use of colors is common in natural illustrations where the focus is on mirroring realistic aspects of the depicted subjects.",

      "question": "Are there visible labels pointing to and identifying the owl’s talons and feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diagram includes labels such as 'Beak origin' and 'East crescent' near the lunar representation. However, there are no clear labels pointing to parts of the owl like its talons and feathers. Labels are generally used in scientific diagrams to identify specific features, but they are absent for the owl.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a dotted diagram with labeled lunar phases (e.g., waxing gibbous, full moon)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moon in Image B includes dotted lines and labels that suggest it is used as a diagram. Although terms like 'Beak origin' and 'East crescent' appear on the image, these labels do not correspond directly to standard lunar phases such as 'waxing gibbous' or 'full moon'. Thus, it does not display traditional lunar phase labels.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a text box located at the bottom of the image containing a short, descriptive paragraph about owl nocturnal adaptations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a text box near the bottom that contains a paragraph. The style and placement resemble a typical descriptive text box often found in illustrated guides. However, the exact content references various abstract ideas about owls without centering specifically on nocturnal adaptations. This type of text usually sits alongside illustrations to provide more scientific information or thematic descriptions.",
