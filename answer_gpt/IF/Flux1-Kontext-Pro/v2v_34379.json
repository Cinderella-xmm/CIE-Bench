      "question": "Are the vegetables in the dish visibly smaller than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli and cauliflower appear to be the same size as in Image A. The shape and size of each piece of broccoli and cauliflower seem consistent between both images. By observing the visual cues and using common sense, it can be inferred that the vegetables in Image B are not noticeably smaller than those in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the space between the vegetables increased due to their shrinkage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the space between the pieces of broccoli and cauliflower does not appear to have increased. The vegetables are packed closely together in both images. When compared with Image A, the arrangement and space occupied by the vegetables are similar, indicating that there hasn’t been an increased space due to shrinkage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vegetables maintain their original shapes and colors despite being smaller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables maintain their shape, but they differ in color compared to their appearance in Image A due to apparent cooking or roasting, as indicated by the golden-brown color. Since they aren’t smaller, there’s no factor of them maintaining their size. Nonetheless, their transformation in color is noticeable, pointing to a cooking process, which explains the difference. Despite this color change, assuming they were smaller, they wouldn't maintain their original colors.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the size of the dish holding the vegetables unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the same type and size of the dish as seen in Image A is used to hold the vegetables. Both images depict identical dishes, suggesting the size hasn’t been altered. The consistency in dish size helps with identifying the vegetables’ arrangement and aids in comparing their cooked state.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any new elements been added or existing elements removed besides shrinking the vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, comparing it with Image A, no additional elements are introduced nor have any been removed. The primary transformation is the change in the vegetables' color due to roasting. The dish compositions between the images remain otherwise consistent, with no additions or removals of items beyond what is observed due to cooking.",
