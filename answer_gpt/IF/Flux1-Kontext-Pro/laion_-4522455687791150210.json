      "question": "Is the woman depicted as a marble statue rather than a living person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman appears to be a marble statue. The visual cues indicate the uniform marble texture and coloration throughout her figure, which suggests it is sculpted rather than being a photo of a living person. The sheen and uniform color associated with marble statues are evident, supporting the conclusion.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the folds of the saree are carefully sculpted with detailed ridges and curves. This craftsmanship suggests the intention to simulate the natural movement and flow of fabric, an approach common in sculpture to imply lifelike dynamics.",
