      "question": "Is the thermometer depicted in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a thermometer with three-dimensional features. The depth and shading give it a realistic appearance rather than a cartoon-like one. Commonly, cartoon styles exhibit exaggerated features or simplifications, which are not present here. The detailed and precise rendering aligns more with realistic portrayals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image use soft lighting to highlight the thermometer's metallic finish and clearly visible dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, soft lighting can be observed through the gentle shadows and highlights on the metal finish of the thermometer, enhancing its three-dimensional look and visibility of details on the dial. This kind of lighting helps bring out the metallic quality and ensures all the markings are legible.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] clearly incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no specific stats labeled [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] in Image B. The visible numbers and indications on the thermometer face specify the regular temperature range, but these precise stats are absent.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a clearly visible title banner at the top, which states 'PRECISION THERMAL GAUGE'. This label suggests an emphasis on accuracy and quality of the instrument.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A nameplate is present at the bottom in Image B, which identifies the item with the word 'THERMOMETER'. This serves to classify and provide context to the depicted instrument.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a definite border encapsulating the card design. These borders are sharp and distinct, framing the overall content of the image securely.",

      "question": "Is the background in cool, professional tones that subtly convey scientific precision?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is in blue, a color often associated with professionalism, science, and precision. The tonal choice coupled with the rays emerging from the center give a sense of focus and technical detail, which are attributes commonly aligned with scientific instruments.",
