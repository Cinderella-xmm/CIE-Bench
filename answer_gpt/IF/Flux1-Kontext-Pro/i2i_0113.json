      "question": "Is the character presented as a soft vinyl figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate a figure that has smooth, uniform surfaces and a slightly exaggerated, stylized appearance common in soft vinyl figures. The finish suggests it's a collectible or display item rather than a realistic representation of a human. The reasoning is based on recognizing characteristics common in toys and figures made from soft vinyl materials.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the figure standing on a round, flat black base, which is typical for display figures, allowing them to stand upright and stable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible indications of interchangeable accessories such as weapons. The figure itself appears to be a standalone piece without additional parts for customization or accessory swapping.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show or indicate interchangeable accessories for various hand gestures. The hands of the figure are uniformly the same, suggesting no extra parts for changing gestures.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite being stylized, notable features of the character's costume—such as the black suit, detailed with seams and belts—remain consistent with Image A's representation of the character. The distinct hairstyle and overall appearance are preserved; thus, the character is recognizable.",
