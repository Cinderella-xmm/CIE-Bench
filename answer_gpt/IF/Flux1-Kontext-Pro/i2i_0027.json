      "question": "Has the dog been converted into a chibi-style blind box figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the dog exhibits characteristics typical of chibi-style figures, such as an enlarged head, exaggerated eyes, and a cute, compact form. These traits combined with its appearance suggest a chibi-style blind box figure. Analyzing the original image (Image A) shows a real dog with natural proportions and realistic textures, which contrasts with the edited version's stylized features.",

      "question": "Is the dog’s body still in the prone, ball-focused pose after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the dog is in a sitting or crouching pose rather than a prone one, focusing on the ball. The emphasis is on detailing the dog’s new pose and examining changes from the original. The original image (Image A) depicts a dog in a prone pose, actively sniffing or interacting with the tennis ball.",

      "question": "Has the dog's head been enlarged slightly compared to its original size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows an exaggerated head size commonly found in chibi-style figures, which is more prominent compared to its body. The original image features a dog with natural proportions. The comparison indicates that Image B has intentionally enlarged the dog’s head.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball placed so that it touches the dog's nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is in the proximity of the dog's nose, creating an impression of interaction. Comparing to Image A where the ball is directly in front of the dog's nose, Image B gives a sense that they are very near but not necessarily touching directly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base feature a relief tennis ball pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B has a distinct design that resembles tennis ball patterns, identifiable due to its circular motifs that are typical of tennis ball surfaces. Analyzing these design elements reflects how the base echoes tennis ball imagery. This aspect of the design contrasts with the absence of such a detailed base in Image A.",
