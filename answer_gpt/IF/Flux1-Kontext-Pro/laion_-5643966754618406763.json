      "question": "Is the stack of tires reshaped into a creature resembling an armadillo with a segmented, armored back made from the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation shows a creature that resembles an armadillo with a segmented, armored back. This creature is constructed in such a way that the tire treads are used to represent the armor on its back, retaining their pattern to give the impression of a protective, segmented veneer. This transformation of the stack of tires into a creature form with a distinct resemblance to an armadillo is apparent based on recognizing the animal-like shape and structure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although there are mechanical elements involved, the style does not heavily lean towards the traditionally defined steampunk aesthetic. The elements are more sci-fi with metallic nodes and tech-like accents, lacking the characteristic steampunk gears or brass tones.",
