      "question": "Are the surfers replaced with pandas holding surfboards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures standing on the beach appear to be anthropomorphic pandas rather than humans. This conclusion is drawn from their furry black and white bodies, which are characteristic features of pandas, in combination with the familiar visual cues of surfboards being held by these figures. This indicates that the original surfers have been replaced with pandas holding surfboards.",

      "question": "Is the sunset and beach setting kept intact without any changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a beach setting with the horizon, sand, and sun, all similar to a typical sunset scene seen in Image A. The background elements like the ocean and the sky maintain their natural hues and composition, which reflects no significant alteration in these elements compared to the original setting. Thus, confirming that the sunset and beach setting is kept intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original surfers, facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas are standing side by side on the beach in a stance reflecting the posture of the original surfers; their backs are turned towards the viewer and they are facing the sunset. This positioning is virtually identical to the surfers in Image A who are also standing on the beach facing the sunset.",

      "question": "Are the pandas holding surfboards in their paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas are visibly holding surfboards with their paws. The visual position of the surfboards parallel to the pandas and nestled in their arms supports this observation, confirming that the pandas are indeed holding the surfboards similarly to how the surfers in Image A held them.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfboards in Image B maintain the visual cues of the original design and colors found in Image A. The surfboard on the left is yellow while the one on the right has a red and cyan color scheme, consistent with the original image. Thus, the surfboards do retain their original colors and design.",
