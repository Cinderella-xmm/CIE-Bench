      "question": "Does the robot exhibit a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is shown with surfaces that appear to have a combination of textures. The metallic areas appear smooth, resembling a brushed finish, and there are less reflective, more muted surfaces that suggest a matte appearance. These visual elements together make it reasonable to conclude that there appears to be a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robot displayed inside a hexagonal box labeled \"MECHA VANGUARD\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is indeed presented inside a container that is hexagonal in shape, with the label 'MECHA VANGUARD' prominently displayed at the top. This matches the description provided in the question.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple weapons visible, indicating they are replaceable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot with a prominent sword and a gun, which visually implies that it is equipped with multiple weapons. However, it does not visually indicate that they are specifically replaceable, as this detail is not evident just by viewing the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the armor plates of the robot appear smooth without any intricate engravings or patterns. The robot seems to have mostly flat surfaces and sharp edges, typical of mechanical design, but lacks detailed engravings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's structure shows clear mechanical joint articulations, particularly at the shoulders, elbows, and hips, which are necessary for movement and flexibility in humanoid robots. These are structurally distinct and noticeably present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the area behind the robot within the hexagonal container displays a dramatic digital background featuring a deep blue theme with wave-like patterns. However, it does not depict a cityscape, futuristic or otherwise.",
