      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the jagged mountain peaks transformed into ancient dragon spirits with distinct dragon-like features such as heads, limbs, and tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the various elements that were previously mountain peaks have now been enhanced with dragon-like features. There is a prominent dragon head with visible details like eyes and mouth, and the body of the creature extends across the landscape, resembling a dragon. These features are indicative of a transformation into dragon spirits with characteristic traits such as heads, limbs, and tails.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mountain surfaces feature visible rocky scales that mimic dragon skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the mountains in Image B appears to have been modified to include textures that resemble scales. These are typical of dragon skin and are visually distinct features that align with the idea of the mountains having dragon-like appearances.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spines of the dragon-shaped mountains covered in moss-like vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the spine of the dragon-like forms there is visible green cover that resembles moss or vegetation. This gives the impression that these spines are covered in moss-like vegetation, enhancing their organic, natural appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tallest mountain peak reshaped into a dragon’s head with clearly visible crystal horns and serpentine eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tallest peak in Image B has been transformed to exhibit clear dragon-like features. It possesses a head with crystal-like structures that form horns, as well as discernible eye features, lending a serpentine aspect to the peak.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the mountain ridges extend into sinuous, snake-like bodies that fade into the mist, with sections resembling coiled limbs or tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ridges in Image B are styled in a way that they extend into snake-like, sinuous forms. They trail into the mist with shapes that are suggestive of limbs or tails, consistent with how a dragon's body could be depicted in this scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the dragon-shaped mountains blend seamlessly into the surrounding misty, atmospheric environment without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon-like features of the mountains merge smoothly with the mist and fog that pervades the scene. There are no abrupt transitions or visual discontinuities, which makes the dragons look as though they naturally belong in this environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the overall lighting and atmospheric quality (such as warm glow, mist, and layered depth) preserved from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B has undergone significant modifications to include fantastical elements, the atmospheric quality observed in the original—like the warm glow, presence of mist, and depth created by layered elements—appears to be preserved. This suggests that the overall mood and lighting from Image A has been maintained even after the transformations.",
