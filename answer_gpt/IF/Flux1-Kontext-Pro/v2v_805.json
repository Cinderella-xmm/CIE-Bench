      "question": "Has the original book illustration been replaced with a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a snow globe on a shelf featuring the book illustration inside it. In Image A, the image only shows an open book illustration without any additional elements like a snow globe. Therefore, the book illustration has been encapsulated within a snow globe in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a snow globe placed prominently on a wooden shelf, with books positioned closely on either side, creating a surrounded effect. The presence of the books and the positioning on the shelf indicates that the snow globe is indeed surrounded by books.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is slightly blurred, contributing to a warm and inviting ambiance. The lighting emanating from the lamp adds a soft glow with shades of orange and yellow, which are typical of a cozy environment one might associate with a library.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the snow globe in Image B, the book illustration is consistent with the original open book design from Image A, shown in a two-dimensional style rather than a 3D chibi model. There are no fluttering pages or snowy effects within the snow globe, only the illustration surrounded by sparkles.",
