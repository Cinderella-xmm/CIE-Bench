      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated features such as large eyes, simplified facial structure, and stylized proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's depiction shifts from realistic to a more stylized and cartoonish form. Common characteristics of a cartoon style are evident: simplified facial structures with less detailing in the eyes and facial proportions. These features are typical in many anime and manga illustrations, where the focus often shifts to the vibrancy and stylistic representation rather than realism.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the girl's kimono exaggerated with flowing, dynamic designs and rendered in significantly brighter, more vivid colors than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does exhibit changes in the kimono patterns, which are recreated in a more stylized manner using broader and more distinct patterns, but the hue and vibrancy of the colors have not significantly changed. Typically in art, heightened color saturation is used to create a lively image or pronounced patterns. However, there's no drastic change in color vibrancy from Image A to Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanging elements remained as lanterns and have not been converted into entirely different forms such as colorful balloons. While the colors and style of lanterns might have been reinterpreted in the artistic style, their form didn't transform into spherical balloons.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible titles written in what appears to be traditional-style fonts, akin to kanji or brush script, on certain parts of the images. This style is coherent with traditional Asian artworks, where bold calligraphy often complements illustration.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any detachable section or specific marked space for personal messages. Typically, such sections might be demarcated by lines or differently colored areas in postcards, but none are visible here.",
