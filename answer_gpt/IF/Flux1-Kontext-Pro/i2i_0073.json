      "question": "Has the reflection in the mirror been replaced with a nighttime city skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the mirror shows a city skyline with buildings that appear to be lit up, a characteristic of a nighttime cityscape. This is visually distinct and recognizable as a city skyline, contrasting with what would likely be a more expected reflection in a bathroom mirror, such as the room or oneself. By applying this visual observation and knowledge of what mirrors typically reflect, it's clear that the reflection in the image has been altered to display a city skyline.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the new reflection in the mirror enhance visual depth compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the mirror likely reflected the bathroom setup, a flat and limited-depth view. However, Image B shows a city skyline, typically an expansive view with varied structures and illuminated details at varying distances. This variation naturally enhances the visual depth due to the presence of multiple depth cues such as overlapping buildings, atmospheric perspective, and lighting variance, which are associated with a cityscape.",

      "question": "Is the mirror's position and frame identical to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positions and frames in both Image A and Image B appear to be the same. In both images, the mirror is centrally located above the sink with a consistent frame design. Recognizing consistency in architectural and interior design setup, and given no visible alterations around the mirror's area, we conclude the mirror's position and frame remain unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the new reflection include elements indicative of a nighttime setting, such as a dark sky and lit buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of the city skyline includes a dark sky and the buildings appear illuminated, typical indicators of nighttime. The presence of lit buildings further reinforces this interpretation as artificial lighting at night is a common urban feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the sink, countertop, and accessories remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the sink, marble countertop, and accessory arrangements (such as the soap dispenser and vase) are consistent with their placement and appearance in Image A. No alterations are observed in the bathroom setup itself apart from the change in mirror reflection.",
