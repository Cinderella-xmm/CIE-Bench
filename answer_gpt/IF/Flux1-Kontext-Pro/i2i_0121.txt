    "Question": "Q1: Does the character display exaggerated chibi proportions with a larger head and smaller body?",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the character standing on a shell-shaped base?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the character as a figure with a round base, which is common for supporting such figurines. There is no visual indicator of the base being shell-shaped.

    "Question": "Q3: Does the chibi version retain the character's straw hat, red jacket, and cheerful expression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, the character is wearing a straw hat and a red jacket similar to those in Image A. While we cannot definitively confirm the expression due to blurring, from the stylized elements visible, it's inferred that the chibi version maintains the cheerful look, as typical chibi characters are often depicted with happy expressions.

    "Question": "Q4: Are the characterâ€™s features (like buttons on the jacket and belt) simplified but still recognizable in the chibi design?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows simplified but identifiable features of the character. The red jacket includes buttons that, while less detailed than in Image A, are recognizable. The yellow belt is also present and simplified, consistent with the chibi design's approach to maintaining essential features while reducing detail for cuteness and abstraction.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the shell-shaped base clearly visible under the character's feet?",
