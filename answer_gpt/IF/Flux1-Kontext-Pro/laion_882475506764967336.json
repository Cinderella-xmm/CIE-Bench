      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the table and chairs visibly constructed from LEGO bricks with interlocking patterns and stud details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs exhibit traits typical of LEGO constructions, such as the smooth edges and uniformity reminiscent of interlocking patterns. However, the lack of visible studs, which are circular protrusions common on LEGO pieces, suggests that while it is designed to mimic LEGO style, it might not fully implement traditional interlocking patterns with visible studs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats feature interlocking LEGO brick patterns consistent with modular construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tabletop and chairs in Image B are smooth and uniform, lacking visible interlocking brick patterns or studs that are characteristic of LEGO's modular design. This smoothness indicates a design that resembles LEGO but does not literalize the interlocking pattern typical of LEGO bricks.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a LEGO-style plant element placed in the center of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a plant element centered on the table that visually resembles a LEGO piece with its bright green synthetic appearance, akin to LEGO foliage, distinguished by a simple geometric form commonly used in LEGO constructions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that replaces the original concrete patio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the furniture set on a surface resembling a typical flat, gray LEGO baseplate, identifiable by its smooth surface with a subtle grid indicative of modular baseplate design, replacing the concrete patio seen in settings like Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the complex background elements such as the wooden fence, potted plants, and outdoor lighting are either removed or significantly simplified, creating a very plain, uncluttered backdrop that enhances focus on the furniture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The furniture in Image B displays colors mostly in brown shades with slight variations that resemble amber tones, maintaining a consistent coloration scheme throughout, aligning with typical LEGO color options without deviations.",
