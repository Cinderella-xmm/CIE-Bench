    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the building facade now appear as an organic, alien-like structure rather than a conventional architectural design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's structure exhibits fluid, organic forms with curved lines that resemble biological or alien elements, such as tentacles, giving it a more organic, alien-like appearance. This contrasts with conventional architectural designs that tend to have more geometric and straight-edged lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the curved elements of the building transformed into distinct tentacle-like appendages extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curved elements in the edited image (Image B) have been modified to resemble tentacle-like appendages, with winding shapes that extend from the main body of the structure, enhancing the organic and alien-like theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are fibrous, strand-like textures visibly applied across sections of the buildingâ€™s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture appears to be smooth and sleek rather than fibrous or strand-like. The design focuses more on a glossy, fluid appearance without visible fibrous textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all window surfaces been replaced with translucent, membrane-like panels that appear soft and non-rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window surfaces in the edited image (Image B) appear as reflective glass rather than soft, membrane-like materials. They retain transparency and the traditional rigid characteristics of glass, which are consistent with a typical architectural window design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal surface detailed with overlapping, iridescent scale-like patterns that reflect multiple colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the building in the edited image (Image B) does not exhibit scale-like patterns or iridescent, color-changing properties. Instead, it maintains a smooth metallic look without such detailed texturing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there glowing, bio-luminescent lines along the edges of the structure that emit an eerie, unnatural light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are visible glowing lines along the structure's edges, which appear to emit a bioluminescent, eerie glow. This effect supports the alien-like and otherworldly theme of the building and enhances its surreal appearance under a less natural lighting environment.",
