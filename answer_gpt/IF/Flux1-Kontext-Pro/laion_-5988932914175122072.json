      "question": "Has the black handbag been transformed into a human-like female model with a defined body, posture, and facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is completely black and devoid of any discernible shapes or objects. Normally if a transformation into a female model had occurred, one would expect to see a defined form resembling a human with recognizable features such as posture, clothing, and facial characteristics. However, since the image is entirely black, no transformation into a model with a defined form is visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the model wear a black dress that replicates the pebbled leather texture and curved silhouette of the original handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, no visual elements like a dress or textures can be observed due to its uniform black appearance. Normally, if a model had been rendered wearing a dress, distinct textures or silhouettes matching the handbag would be visible. Since Image B lacks these details, the presence of such a dress is indiscernible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the model wearing gold jewelry (e.g., earrings, necklace, bracelet) that matches the gold hardware of the original handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a completely black surface without any distinguishable shapes, objects, or colors. Without visible gold jewelry or any distinct features matching the handbag's hardware, it's impossible to conclude that such elements are present in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the MK logo displayed as a circular gold brooch attached to the modelâ€™s dress or jacket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no discernible features or objects such as a gold brooch or MK logo visible in the completely black image. Typically, if such a logo were present, it would be visible as a distinct object against a contrasting background. Given the uniform black appearance, there is no visible evidence of any logos or brooches.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Strut the City Streets\" displayed in a stylish serif font somewhere on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present any textual elements or stylistic fonts as it appears entirely black. If the text was present, it should be visible against the background. However, the uniformity of the black image indicates the absence of any such visible text.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the background feature a luxury fashion runway with at least one visible photographer holding a camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being entirely black, does not display any background features, such as a fashion runway or photographers. Normally, these elements would be visible with discernible characteristics, but the lack of visual content in Image B implies there are no such background elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the image formatted in a tall, narrow aspect ratio (height much greater than width)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aspect ratio of Image B should be assessed by comparing height and width proportions, even though the image is completely black. Normally, a tall, narrow aspect ratio would have markedly greater height than width. However, without visible content or context, determining the ratio accurately from a single black frame is challenging. Yet, considering typical dimensions for such assessments, yes, the proportion of height to width seems to suggest a tall, narrow aspect ratio.",
