      "question": "Is the horse sculpture enclosed in a transparent box that allows full visibility of its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse sculpture is clearly placed inside a transparent box, and the transparency allows for full visibility of the sculpture's form from the front and sides. The box is clear on all visible sides, providing an unobstructed view of the sculpture. This setup aligns with the expectation of a showcase, which is designed to provide visibility without obstruction.",

      "question": "Are there visible gold-colored decorative elements or trim on the transparent showcase box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any obvious gold-colored trim or decorative elements directly on the surface of the transparent box itself. The box appears to be simple and clear with no visible embellishments that would qualify as gold trim.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is a modern and elegantly designed brand logo visible on the black base stand beneath the showcase box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base under the transparent box clearly displays a logo with the brand name 'LANQUSC' along with smaller text 'GORGEFIL'. The design of this logo with its elegant typography suggests a modern and stylish aesthetic. This indicates that the setup is meant to highlight the product with brand visibility.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a textured backdrop inside the showcase box featuring a pattern inspired by ancient Chinese art or motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible backdrop inside the showcase box that features a pattern of circular, ornate designs. These designs resemble traditional motifs often associated with ancient Chinese art and sculpture, which frequently utilize repetitive and symbolic patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the showcase box have a seamless, flush closure suggesting a magnetic mechanism rather than a hinge or latch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the box with straight edges and a clean finish, but there is no direct visual information available to definitively confirm the type of closure mechanism used. No hinges, latches, or apparent seams are visible, yet making assumptions about magnetic closures without explicit visual confirmation is speculative. Therefore, based on the observable data, the type of closure cannot be conclusively determined.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture within the transparent box appears to be fully visible without any part of it being obscured or distorted by the box. The transparency ensures that every detail of the sculpture is visible, and nothing from the box surface interferes with this visibility.",
