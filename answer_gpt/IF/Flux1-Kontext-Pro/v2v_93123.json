      "question": "Has the diffuse, smoky brown background been replaced with an expansive blackboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the background is clearly a blackboard with chalk drawings and writings. This contrasts with the original image (Image A), where the background is a smoky brown texture. The visual cue of the blackboard, along with common knowledge of classroom settings, supports the conclusion that the background has been changed to a blackboard.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blackboard intricately covered with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blackboard features various chalk drawings, including swirling shapes and symbols that resemble scientific notations. This implies the presence of scientific elements or equations. The addition of swirling galactic sketches aligns with themes of relativity and space often associated with Albert Einstein. Therefore, the imagery suggests that these are equations and sketches related to scientific concepts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple remain consistent after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images maintain warm, soft lighting on the depicted subjects: Albert Einstein and the pineapple. Despite the change in background, the lighting and illumination on these subjects appear similar in tone and intensity, indicating consistency in the lighting setup.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the blackboard exhibit an aged appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the blackboard has signs of wear, such as faint chalk marks and smudges, which are typical signs of an older, used blackboard. The appearance suggests historical or prolonged use, contributing to an aged look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the original and edited images, both Albert Einstein and the pineapple are positioned similarly with respect to each other, and their appearances have not been altered. This conclusion is drawn from visual consistency in their posture, attire, and appearance, aside from the blurred face, which remains constant across both images.",
