    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figurine made of a glossy, smooth ceramic material instead of knitted yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the figurine appears smooth and shiny, suggesting a glossy material like ceramic. This differs from Image A, where the texture is clearly that of knitted yarn, identifiable by the loops and fibers visible on the surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figurine's color a vibrant terracotta tone (a rich reddish-brown)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine displays a rich reddish-brown color, typical of terracotta. This is a vibrant tone that contrasts with Image A's neutral yarn color, which is more beige or off-white.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate floral engravings on the surface of the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows textured patterns across the figurine's surface, but these do not resemble intricate floral engravings. Instead, the patterns are more abstract and random. This contrasts with Image A, where there are no surface engravings or patterns at all due to the knitted material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the eyes resemble small polished amber stones in color, texture, and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the figurine are glossy and have a warm, dark hue, similar to polished amber stones. This gives them a smooth and slightly translucent appearance, unlike in Image A, where the eyes are made of solid material commonly used in crocheted or knitted crafts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figurine placed on a simple wooden tabletop with a minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine on a light wooden surface, which is indicative of a wooden tabletop. The background is plain and unobtrusive, which fits with a minimalist aesthetic. In contrast, Image A does not provide context for a tabletop and appears to be held by a human hand against a plain background.",
