    "Question": "Q1: Is the police car fully constructed from LEGO bricks, with no realistic or photographic elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the police car appears to be modeled in a manner consistent with LEGO structures. The car has distinct brick-like separations, a characteristic of a LEGO build. The plastic appearance of the components also suggests construction from LEGO bricks, as seen in toys. There are no photographic elements that capture real-world textures or details which wouldn't be possible with LEGO materials. Thus, the design adheres to the aesthetic and construction style typical of LEGO structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the body panels of the car primarily composed of blue and black LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the body panels of the police car predominantly show a blue color, with additional features such as the bumper and other small elements in black. This color scheme is consistent with the use of mainly blue and black LEGO bricks to construct the vehicle. The design is simple and modular, focusing on these two primary colors which is typical of LEGO vehicle designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the emergency lights on top and the front headlights made from red and blue translucent LEGO pieces?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the emergency lights on top of the police car are in red and blue colors, showing a translucent quality which is common in LEGO pieces used for simulating lights. The front headlights also exhibit a reflective, translucent quality, consistent with how LEGO constructs headlights using clear or translucent pieces. This matches the style often used in LEGO for emergency vehicle lights.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the windows of the car constructed from beige LEGO bricks instead of transparent or clear pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, an examination of the car's windows shows a surface that does not exhibit typical transparency, consistent with an absence of clear elements. Instead, the windows appear to have solid color, suggestive of a shaded tone that can be seen as a beige brick-like material. This depiction is not transparent, which aligns with using colored LEGO bricks instead of clear ones for the windows.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the grille and wheels constructed from small LEGO blocks showing detailed brickwork and modular structure?",
    "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the grille and wheels are built in a blocky, elemental style which is consistent with LEGO construction. The grille, with its grid-like structure, and the tires have a simplistic, segmented appearance indicating modular assembly from smaller bricks rather than a singular, smooth piece. However, there is less evidence of detailed brickwork specifically for the wheels, which many times could be simplistic in LEGO models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the LEGO car positioned on a plain matte gray surface with no additional textures, patterns, or background details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop features a plain gray surface without any discernible textures or patterns. It serves as a minimalist scene for display, typical in product photography intended to highlight the object without distractions. This clean and simple background indicates a matte surface that is undetailed beyond the car itself.",
    "answer": "Yes"
