      "question": "Is there a keychain depicted in the image, featuring the character design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character design is clearly visible as a 3D model of Psyduck, a well-known Pok√©mon character. Given its detailed and toy-like appearance, it resembles a collectible or figurine rather than a keychain. Keychains typically have attachment parts like rings or clips, which are not visible in Image B, suggesting this is not a keychain. However, it is important to note the context and appearance, which may indicate it is an office decoration or small figure rather than a keychain.",

      "question": "Is the keychain placed on a wooden office desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene where the Psyduck figure is positioned on a wooden surface, which can be identified as an office desk based on the presence of related elements like books, a laptop, and glasses. The desk is clearly wooden due to its texture and color. Since no keychain is represented, the focus is on the placement of the figure, indicating the assumption about the keychain is incorrect but verifying the wooden desk placement.",

      "question": "Are there books visible next to the keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beside the Psyduck figure, several books are visible, stacked one over the other. The visual cues convey the orderly arrangement typically found in office or study environments, reinforcing the presence next to the collectible figure. Despite the absence of a keychain, the books are clearly part of the setting alongside Psyduck.",

      "question": "Are glasses visible next to the keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of Image B, a pair of glasses are partially visible resting on the desk. These glasses are close to the Psyduck figure, fitting the office desk context. While a keychain is not directly depicted, the glasses are evidently part of the overall desk items shown next to the character figure.",

      "question": "Is the keychain properly positioned on the desk with books and glasses next to it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the Psyduck figure on a wooden desk, surrounded by books and glasses. The arrangement suggests an intended and organized positioning for these elements. Although the examination reveals no explicit depiction of a keychain in Image B, the figure itself is well-positioned among other items, reflecting a thoughtful arrangement indicative of a neat and purposeful placement.",
