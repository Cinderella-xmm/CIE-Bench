    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is depicted with simplified lines and exaggerated proportions, characteristic of a semi-cartoon style. This can be observed in the less detailed rendering of clothing, hair, and laboratory equipment, which have a more stylized appearance compared to realistic depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laboratory apparatus such as test tubes and monitors are not as detailed and are more stylized compared to Image A. The lines are simpler and there is less emphasis on realism and refinement, consistent with a cartoon style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently uses teal and white colors, which are dominant in the background and clothing of the scientist. These colors contribute to a clean, scientific aesthetic often associated with laboratory environments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image include multiple monthly sections, each featuring a different scientific motif such as molecular structures or data patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show multiple monthly sections or any scientific motifs specifically associated with calendar months. The image focuses on the scientist and lab equipment, without dividing it into sections for different motifs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no bold, tech-inspired headers or sections that suggest a calendar format with such features. The focus remains on the scene within the laboratory setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does contain circular diagrams and potential data visualization on the monitors, there is no indication that these are integrated into a calendar design. They appear as part of the lab's monitoring equipment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image display a polished, reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, with its semi-cartoon style, does not have a polished, reflective appearance that simulates high-quality gloss paper. The artwork presents a more matte finish typical of illustrated styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
