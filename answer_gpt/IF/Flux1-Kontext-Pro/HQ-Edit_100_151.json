      "question": "Is the child depicted with exaggerated cartoon-style features such as large eyes, oversized head, or stylized expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, the child appears to have natural proportions related to the body and does not exhibit exaggerated cartoon-style features like oversized head or large eyes in the visible parts. Cartoon-style usually implies prominent proportions and stylized expressions which are not evident here.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat and balloons are depicted in vibrant and saturated colors, showing clear and bold tones rather than soft or desaturated pastel colors. Pastel colors typically appear muted and subtle, which is not the case in this image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a calendar grid can be seen hanging from the child's balloon strings. This suggests a visual integration into the scene, giving the impression that the calendar is part of this stylized depiction.",
