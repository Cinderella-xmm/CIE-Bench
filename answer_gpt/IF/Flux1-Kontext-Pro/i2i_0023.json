    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the photo been converted into a minimalist flat illustration-style sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays characteristics of a minimalist flat illustration style, such as simplified shapes, uniform color areas, and a white outline around the elements. The original photo has been edited to create a flatter, more sticker-like appearance with reduced details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the boy and all bird outlines clearly present in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, outlines are added around the boy and all birds to differentiate them from the background, creating a clear separation characteristic of illustrations where distinct outlines are common.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have block colors been used for the boy's skin tones and the birds' feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows block colors applied uniformly across the boy's skin tones and birds' feathers. This technique is typical in flat illustrations where textures are minimized in favor of solid color fills.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a stark black background, contrasting with the original Image A where the background is a realistic indoor setting. The removal of the detailed background from Image A suggests an intentional simplification in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the boyâ€™s head been slightly enlarged and the birds shrunk to achieve a neatly arranged composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparison between Image A and Image B, there is no apparent intentional resizing of the boy's head or birds to affect composition. Image B retains similar proportions to those in Image A regarding the relative sizes of the boy and birds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has a thick white outline been added around the boy and birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a thick white outline added around the boy and birds, distinguishing them from the black background. This aligns with typical sticker and illustration design, where such outlines are used for emphasis.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image have a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a transparent background; instead, it features a solid black background, completely replacing the background seen in Image A.",
