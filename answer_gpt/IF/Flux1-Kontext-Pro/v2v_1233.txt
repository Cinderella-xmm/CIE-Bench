    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image display a dynamic pop-art comic design throughout the hospital setting?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the hospital setting is characterized by its realistic representation. The room features medical equipment, hospital staff, and a patient in a hospital bed. A dynamic pop-art comic design typically includes exaggerated and graphic artistic elements, such as bold outlines, vibrant color combinations, and cartoonish expressions, none of which are present here. The image maintains a more traditional, realistic style seen in a hospital environment.",
