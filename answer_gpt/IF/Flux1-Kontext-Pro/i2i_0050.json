    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image contain three separate frames capturing the skater's motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are two main parts: the top section featuring two horses and the bottom section featuring a skater. The lower section of the image portrays two frames, not three, showing the skater's different motion positions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three frames clearly showing the push-off, ground contact, and forward lean of the skater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that the edited image displays only two frames of the skater rather than three, it is not possible to show all three motions: push-off, ground contact, and forward lean in separate frames. Therefore, the motion stages are not fully represented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image retain the real image style without any significant stylistic distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains a natural photographic style both in the background scenery and the depiction of the skater, with no noticeable alterations that suggest a shift from a realistic image style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are motion trajectory lines present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the bottom section of the edited image, the skater's motion is depicted with two lines beneath the skater's feet in each frame, indicating the path of motion. This inclusion aligns with the concept of motion trajectory.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three frames combined in a cohesive manner within the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image consists of two frames of the skater rather than three. Therefore, it cannot be described as combining three frames cohesively within the image.",
