      "question": "Is the zebra depicted in a stylized 3D chibi form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is portrayed with realistic and detailed features, typical of a natural zebra, indicating that it maintains the natural proportions and textures rather than adopting the large-eyed, small-bodied style characteristic of 3D chibi representations. The stripes and physical details mirror an actual zebra accurately, without exaggerated chibi features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the zebra’s stripes and distinctive pattern accurately depicted as in the original photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the zebra's stripes and pattern are consistent with what is typically seen on a real zebra, much like Image A. Both images show natural zebra patterns and are synonymous with how zebra markings should authentically appear, maintaining an accurate representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the zebra engaging playfully with a miniature replica of the cake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted closely observing a full-sized cake that matches its size, similar to the one shown in Image A. There is no visual indication of a miniature replica being present; the cake size and design remain consistent with a regular cake, not a toy or miniature version.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the zebra leaning forward with a curious look while seated on the edge of an oversized Instagram frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the zebra is shown within an Instagram-style frame on the photo, it maintains the same stance as in Image A, standing on four legs and leaning near the cake. There's no indication of it being seated on the frame or interacting with the frame itself in a dynamic or suggestive pose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top section of the Instagram-style interface clearly displays the username 'ZebraLover' right above the zebra image. This text placement emulates common social media layouts, directly under any user profile or image post title section.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are varying social media icons (like, comment, and share) floating around the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the frame includes typical social media iconography placed in a fixed manner at the bottom of the interface, resembling common social media post layouts. However, these icons do not appear to be 'floating around' the scene, as they are integrated into the interface design, at the usual static locations.",
