    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of surrealism such as dreamlike or unexpected juxtapositions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays elements characteristic of surrealism, such as the blue figure holding a gold banana, which is an unexpected juxtaposition. The use of bold colors and the painted look of the image also contribute to a dreamlike quality. These elements are combined in an unusual manner, aligning with surrealist themes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there abstract shapes and bold contrasts present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The contrast between the blue figure and the gold banana, set against a richly textured background that exhibits swirls and abstract forms, results in bold visual contrasts. These elements reflect the use of bold contrasting colors and abstract shapes that are prominently visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold banana depicted as a levitating geometric form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana is painted gold and held by the blue figure, but it does not give the impression of levitating. The hand's grip on the banana is visually clear, indicating that the item is being held, not floating independently.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the blue figure display liquefying textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture on the blue figure in Image B appears to have a painterly effect, with some blending evident in the colors. However, it does not exhibit a liquefying texture, as might be expected if it seemed to melt or flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background feature warped components that contribute to a fantastical atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features swirling and warped patterns, contributing to a surreal, fantastical atmosphere. The distortion and blending of colors amplify the dreamlike quality, enhancing the image's overall sense of fantasy.",
