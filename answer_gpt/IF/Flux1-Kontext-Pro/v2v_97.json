      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag is depicted as a regular bag without any added features that resemble a moe-style anime character, such as cat-like attributes like ears, whiskers, or a tail.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl is depicted with a facial expression, including anime-style features such as eyes, a wide smile, and cat-like ears, suggesting it is animated and personified as a character in the manga panel. This gives the impression of a lively and playful demeanor.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the bag is presented in a static position without overt anthropomorphic features like grasping. The speech bubble suggests enthusiasm ('It's adventure time! It's gooo!'), but the visual depiction does not show the bag actively grasping. The bowl remains static and does not visually appear to be bouncing, although it is personified with facial expressions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the speech bubble indicates frustration ('Stop rolling away! I can't bo carry you when you do this!'), but the bag itself does not visually display anthropomorphic cues of sweating or nervousness. The bowl is illustrated rolling with the facial features of a cat, expressing a joyful and laughing demeanor consistent with a playful and chaotic spin.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is displayed in a clear typeface typical of comic fonts, but it does not explicitly present a cute or distinctly handwritten style itself. The font is more standard in appearance, particularly suited for clarity in speech bubbles.",
