      "question": "Is the tank's body composed entirely of olive and dark green LEGO bricks, showing a blocky, modular construction consistent with LEGO building style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank clearly displays characteristics typical of a LEGO construction. The body appears to have a blocky, modular structure, which is indicative of being made from LEGO bricks. This is evident from the visible edges and seams between bricks, and the uniform color consistent with a LEGO build, in olive and dark green.",

      "question": "Has the orange tiger decal been replaced with a pattern made of colorful LEGO plates forming a whimsical tiger face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a section on the tank that appears to be constructed with LEGO plates, forming the image of a tiger face. Instead of being a decal, the tiger design comprises a series of colorful LEGO pieces that create a similar tiger face, but with the distinct texture and style of LEGO construction.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tank’s treads made of textured LEGO bricks with visible studs and blocky segments, rather than continuous rubber tracks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank’s treads appear to be made up of LEGO components. These have visible studs and segmented, blocky sections typical of LEGO tracks. This contrasts with continuous rubber tracks, which would appear smoother and more uniform.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tank positioned on a smooth, flat wooden platform without visible gravel or irregular edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base that the tank is situated on in Image B is clearly a smooth, flat surface akin to what would be a wooden platform. It lacks the irregular, textured appearance of gravel or a natural edge, suggesting a change from a natural to an artificial base.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a back panel made of green LEGO bricks behind the tank, designed to mimic foliage and replace the natural tree background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a background that appears to be constructed from uniformly colored green LEGO bricks, arranged in a way that mimics a panel or backdrop. This backdrop provides a simplified and artificial representation of foliage in contrast to the more complex and natural tree background seen in Image A.",
