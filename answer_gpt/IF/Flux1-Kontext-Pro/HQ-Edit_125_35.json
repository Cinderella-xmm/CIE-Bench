        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gemstones adorn the serpent-like creature, creating a shimmering, reflective quality across its body, unlike the mechanical keys on a saxophone. This alteration indicates a replacement of the original saxophone keys with reflective jewels.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature’s head features an open maw with sharp, stylized fangs, distinct from the bell of a saxophone, which lacks such features. This transformation conveys the saxophone’s bell turning into a mythological creature’s mouth.",
