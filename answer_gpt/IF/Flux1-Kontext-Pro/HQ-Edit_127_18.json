      "question": "Is the entire elephant and savannah scene enclosed within a visible vintage travel case structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene with the elephant and the savannah tree is clearly housed within a box structure that resembles a vintage travel case. This conclusion is drawn from the rectangular wooden frame with a clasp that surrounds the scene, indicating it is an enclosed unit similar to a vintage travel case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant and landscape elements appear as detailed miniature 3D models with realistic scaling and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the elephant and the landscape elements, such as the acacia tree and the ground, appear as detailed miniature models. This can be inferred from the precise and intricate detailing on the elephant and tree, consistent with the appearance of scaled-down 3D models in dioramas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ground covered with a material that resembles grass but has a textured, resin-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground beneath the elephant appears to be textured and has a surface that resembles dried grass but with a finish that might suggest a crafted, resin-like look often used in miniature displays. This observation is based on the visual texture and appearance of the material, indicating a resemblance to resin.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small-scale acacia tree placed in the diorama to indicate scale balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beside the elephant model, there is a small, detailed tree which resembles an acacia, commonly found in savannah scenes. This tree serves to provide a sense of scale and contribute to the balance of the diorama, indicating it is indeed used for scaling purposes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky depicted as painted elements on the inner surface of a backdrop lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud formations are seen as part of the backdrop, which suggests they are painted onto the inner surface of the lid. The clouds appear as part of the fixed scene within the case, typical of diorama backdrops where skies and distant scenery are represented on a two-dimensional plane.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, clearly visible at the base of the diorama next to the elephant and tree is a circular object with a brass-like color and the appearance of a compass. This is likely placed to enhance the thematic presentation of a travel or exploration setting.",
