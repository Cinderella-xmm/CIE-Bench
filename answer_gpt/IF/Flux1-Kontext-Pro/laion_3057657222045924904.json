      "question": "Is the McLaren depicted as a highly detailed 3D-rendered model rather than a photographic image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the McLaren appears detailed and encased in a display, suggesting it might be a model. The controlled lighting and flawless surface can indicate a 3D-rendered model. However, common sense and the context of being in a display case suggest it's a highly detailed physical model with realistic features photographed, rather than CGI. Compared to Image A, which shows the car in a showroom, Image B's setting implies a model car scenario.",

      "question": "Is the McLaren enclosed within a transparent acrylic display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the McLaren is clearly visible inside a transparent case made from a glass-like material, suggesting its function as protection or display, reflecting light and allowing visibility from all angles, typical of acrylic displays for models. This affirms the presence of a display case around the car. Comparing with Image A, there's no such enclosure; Image B distinctly shows the car within a case.",

      "question": "Does the car rest on a polished chrome base that resembles a rotating platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the display case holding the McLaren is flat and matte, contrasting with the visual and reflective textures associated with polished chrome. The shape is steady and rectangular, aligning with presentation cases rather than platforms for rotation. Comparing with Image A, the car is on a platform that could be rotational, emphasizing showroom presentation, unlike Image B's static base.",

      "question": "Are subtle carbon fiber textures visible on the interior walls of the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a faint patterned texture on the background inside the case, resembling carbon fiber with its distinctive weave and style, identified by the light reflection and pattern often associated with luxury automotive components. Image A lacks such textures, focusing on a plain wall. The presence suggests upscale design elements consistent with luxury vehicle displays.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a miniature toolset containing micro wrenches and screwdrivers visible and neatly arranged inside the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features small tools like wrenches neatly arranged against the back wall inside the display case. This inclusion fits within the thematic design typical of model displays, creating an intricate setting. Image A does not have tools; it's focused on the car itself. The tools enhance Image B's detailed craftsmanship aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is a laser-etched cityscape silhouette visible around the display case, enhancing the urban aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On Image B, there's an etched or printed outline of city structures visible on the interior walls of the display case, resembling an urban skyline which contributes to the design theme by adding sophisticated, cosmopolitan appeal. Image A lacks such elements and focuses on car presentation. Image B's cityscape enhances the luxury and urban aesthetic ambiance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features meticulous construction with transparent casing, detailed machining, and thematic elements, supported by light management highlighting the enclosed McLaren and features like textures and toolset. These indicate a high-end display setting typical of exclusive environments. While Image A displays the car in a showroom, Image B's elements cater more to a product showcase indicative of premium presentation.",
