      "question": "Have the cheetahs' leg joints been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues on the cheetahs show that their anatomy incorporates mechanical elements. The joints exhibit polished brass and gear-like structures which are not typical of biological limbs. This reflects a mechanical design influenced by steampunk aesthetics where robotic body parts are adorned with brass gears and pistons for a visually intricate and engineered look.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indicates that the cheetahs retain some natural spotted fur pattern but also incorporate sections of tooled leather and copper plating.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' eyes distinctly appear as glowing amber, which is quite different from typical natural eyes. Such lenses imply artificiality and optical components that emit light, adhering to the steampunk aesthetic by integrating technology with natural entities to evoke an advanced yet retro-futuristic feel.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes tall and intricate structures visible in the background that resemble mechanized towers typical of imaginary or fantastical settings. These structures are indicative of a steampunk or industrial revolution theme, combining imaginative architectural designs with the natural savanna landscape.",
