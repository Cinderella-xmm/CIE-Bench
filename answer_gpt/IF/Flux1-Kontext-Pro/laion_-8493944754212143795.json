      "choices": [
        "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks from Image A are not visible as they are fully transformed into the dragon’s body.

      "question": "Do the white foam areas form two distinct, misty cloud-like wings attached to the dragon’s back or sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly defined wings attached to the dragon that are not composed of white foam. The dragon's wings are integrated with its body structure, contributing to the overall mythical design rather than being formed from the water's foam. The misty effect is used creatively only in terms of lighting and texture around the dragon.",
