        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars retain their realistic appearance with no changes to proportions or style that would make them appear as chibi-style animated mascots. Chibi characters are typically characterized by exaggeratedly cute features, such as oversized heads and small bodies, which these cars do not possess. The cars maintain a conventional look similar to Image A.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays a cereal box labeled 'Road Warrior Oats'.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box in Image B is adorned with bright, lively illustrations featuring high-energy graphics reflecting motion and speed, characteristic of a race theme. However, metallic accents are not explicitly identifiable from the image. The box art embellishment depicts cars, which connects to a racing theme, but not specifically with metallic accents.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cereal box alongside the cars in a setting filled with neon lights and sleek aesthetics, resembling a vibrant showroom or possibly a futuristic pit stop. The use of glowing neon lines and the dark backdrop contributes to a contemporary, advanced atmosphere, consistent with descriptions of a futuristic automotive setting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B showcases the 'Road Warrior Oats' cereal packaging and realistic representations of cars, it does not depict any chibi-style car mascots. The cars themselves are standard in appearance and do not exhibit the characteristics of chibi mascots.",
