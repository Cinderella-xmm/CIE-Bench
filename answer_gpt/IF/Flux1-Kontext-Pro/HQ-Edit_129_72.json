    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there visible flames gently flickering from the wingtips and tail of the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird has elements that resemble flames emanating from its wingtips and tail. These flames are depicted as bright and fiery, contrasting against the darker background. The visual cues of bright colors typical of fire, combined with world knowledge of how flames appear, confirm their presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the bird's plumage been replaced with iridescent, shimmering scales instead of solid red feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the bird's body resembles scales rather than typical bird feathers. The iridescent effect, present as varying colors and sheen across the plumage, suggests a scaly composition. Utilizing common knowledge about iridescence and scales reinforces this observation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there distinct fiery patterns (such as flame-like designs or glowing lines) visible across the bird's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays fiery patterns across the bird's body, highlighted by bright glowing lines and flame-like designs. These patterns suggest an intentional portrayal of fire elements, which is underscored by their luminescence and warm colors typical of fire.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bird's eyes appear as glowing embers with a warm, luminous glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bird's eyes have a bright glow, akin to embers. The color choice and intense luminosity emphasize this ember effect, which is consistent with visual characteristics of glowing or fiery objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the branch now made of twisted, dark, glossy obsidian material instead of natural wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch still appears to be made of natural wood, covered in snow. There is no indication of it being twisted or the glossy, dark appearance typical of obsidian. The texture and color remain consistent with what is expected of a snow-covered branch.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the blossoms on the branch depicted as burning or emitting flames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blossoms on the branch appear bright and fiery, although they don't show distinct flames or active burning. They remain largely intact, suggesting they are not emitting flames despite their fiery appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the burning elements (flames, glowing parts) clearly visible in contrast to the falling snowflakes in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The burning elements in Image B, such as the glowing flames on the bird's wings and tail, are strikingly bright and provide a high contrast against the dark background and the white falling snowflakes. This helps them stand out clearly, making the fiery aspects easily discernible.",
