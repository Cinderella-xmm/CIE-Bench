      "question": "Does the edited image depict the chocolate cake as an anthropomorphic cake girl with the luscious chocolate glaze and layered design intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays a girl with brown hair and blue eyes, holding a slice of chocolate cake. The cake slice retains its luscious chocolate glaze and layered design, but there is no anthropomorphic depiction of the cake itself. The anthropomorphism refers to giving human characteristics to non-human entities, and in this image, the cake itself is not transformed into a girl; rather, it's a separate object held by the girl.",

      "choices": [

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image is shown in a vertical format with two panels.
