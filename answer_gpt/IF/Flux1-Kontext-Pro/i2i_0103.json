      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image clearly shows visible and prominent brushstrokes across the entire canvas.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light and dark areas are emphasized through significant contrasts.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements such as the sky, clouds, and even the walls exhibit swirling patterns and dynamic lines that are reminiscent of Van Goghâ€™s style.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a palette that is very vibrant and expressive, with intense blues, greens, and oranges. This color scheme is less about realism and more about evoking emotion through expressive use of strong hues.
