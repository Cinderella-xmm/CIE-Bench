      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style applied changes the texture and surface presentation, drawing inspiration from cubist art. However, the underlying structure of the English manor-style house remains unchanged in terms of its shape and architectural features, like the gabled roof and chimney. Cubist art is characterized by fragmented, abstract representation which is only reflected in the superficial stylistic overlay. Therefore, the structure itself has not been replaced, only its presentation altered, maintaining the same architectural form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original brick surfaces of the house replaced with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes rather than realistic masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a stylistic overlay reminiscent of post-impressionistic or pseudo-cubist art that abstracts textures into swirls and patterns. This overlay affects the visual perception of surfaces including brick, making the pattern appear vibrant and less uniform. Thus, the pixelated and textured overlay implies a departure from realistic masonry, suggesting non-uniform and colorful geometric planes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all individuals in the crowd been rendered as abstract, faceless, and scattered forms devoid of detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crowd is depicted in an abstract art style where figures lose their detailed features, becoming more simplified and impressionistic. Visual cues like shapes are retained, but individual facial details and distinctiveness lack clarity, embodying an abstract representation without clear personal attributes or identity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the grass surface feature a visible checkered pattern overlaying the entire green area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the grass surface through an art style that does not introduce any checkered pattern overlay. The surface maintains a continuous texture, modified by painterly strokes lacking any grid-like or checkered pattern distinction, indicating no purposeful overlay applied in this manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the water reflection been transformed into a series of prismatic, angular shards that distort and fragment the image of the house and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic rendition in Image B transforms the water reflection, introducing more abstract and chaotic swirls and shapes. However, instead of angular shards, the reflection is more fluidly distorted like impressionistic strokes which do not specifically resemble prismatic or cubistic shards but rather stylistic distortions without sharp geometric fragmentation.",
