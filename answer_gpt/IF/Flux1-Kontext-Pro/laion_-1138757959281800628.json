      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire hotel and pool scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene of the hotel and pool is surrounded by a transparent structure that resembles glass walls. This indicates that the scene is enclosed within a glass terrarium. Such a structure makes the entire scene appear contained and compact, a characteristic of terrariums.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the pool display layered water effects, such as visible depth layers or textured surface ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool appears to have a smooth surface without noticeable depth layers or textured surface ripples, typical of a miniaturized representation. The water in miniatures often lacks the complex texture and depth variations seen in real pools.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sunbathers and surrounding trees visibly miniaturized in size relative to the building and pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunbathers and surrounding trees appear significantly smaller in proportion to the building and pool, characteristic of a scale model rather than a real-life depiction. This miniaturization is a common feature of dioramas or models placed within terrariums.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is visible greenery hanging from the balconies of the hotel, indicating the presence of artificial cascading plants. This is a stylistic choice often made in models to enhance aesthetic appeal and simulate a lush environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible small-scale items such as umbrellas and items that resemble poolside accessories, giving the impression of playful, miniature-scale beach accessories. These are designed to complement the miniature setting of the terrarium.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are cotton-like cloud props suspended above the scene, creating the impression of 3D clouds separate from the painted sky backdrop. This enhances the terrarium's whimsical and artistic aesthetic, adding depth to the scene.",
