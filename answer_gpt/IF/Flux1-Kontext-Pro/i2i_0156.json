      "question": "Do the book pages extend out of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pages of the open book are clearly visible, and no part of them appears to extend beyond the frame of the image. The edges of the book are contained within the borders of the photograph, suggesting that they do not protrude or spill over the image boundaries, which is consistent with the common display of books captured from this angle.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a subtle curved shadow on the extended pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a close examination shows gentle shadowing effects, especially where the pages curve near the binding and the edges of the pages catch the light. However, since the pages do not extend out of the frame, any shadowing discussed is part of the standard imaging of books and is consistent with a natural look without additional extended parts creating shadow effects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the editing convey the impression that the book is unfolding toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an open book where the pages naturally curve towards the viewer, a perspective common in photographs capturing open books. This angled shot and the general page layout can create an impression of the pages unfolding towards the viewer, a visual trick produced by the angle and lighting without actually suggesting motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the extended pages visually consistent with the original book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No extended pages appear in Image B, as the pages are fully contained within the frame without any additional elements suggesting an expansion beyond the edges of the book. Thus, the question of visual consistency regarding extended parts does not apply. The visual consistency can only be judged within the frame as all elements are original.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a seamless transition between the original and extended parts of the book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes  \n```",
      "explanation": "In this context, there are no visibly extended parts of the book pages in Image B. As the pages remain within the confines of the image without extra additions, there isn't a transition between different sections that could be described as seamless or otherwise. The entire scene maintains consistency in the original components shown.",
