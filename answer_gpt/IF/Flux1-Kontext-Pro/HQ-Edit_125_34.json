      "question": "Are brass gears and levers visibly integrated into the desk surface or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk exhibits complex carvings and ornate wooden designs typical of Victorian or steampunk decor, but there is no direct visual evidence of brass gears or levers integrated into the desk's surface or structure. This assessment is based solely on observing intricate woodwork without visible metallic elements that would characterize gears or levers.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the books in the image emit a visible glow and contain mechanical bookmarks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The books stacked on the desk and nearby appear ordinary, with leather bindings that are consistent with old, classic books. There is no indication of any glow or visible mechanical bookmarks, which would suggest a more steampunk or futuristic element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the globe on the screen replaced with a floating, translucent 3D holographic model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The screen in Image B displays a digital image of the Earth that appears to have a three-dimensional effect but is not a physically floating or translucent holographic model. This illusion of depth is typical for modern monitors displaying 3D graphics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window frames in Image B show traditional wooden frames without any signs of steampunk-specific detailing like brass or mechanical features. The style is more in line with Victorian-era aesthetics than steampunk design, which would typically include metallic and mechanical motifs.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible text or title incorporated into Image B that reads \"The Time Traveler's Study\" or any other heading. The image focuses on visual elements without any labeling.",
