      "question": "Are the structural lines of the cabin composed entirely of geometric shapes with no organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin structure is presented mainly with straight lines and angular forms, which are indicative of geometric shapes. The beams, roof lines, and other architectural details in the edited image maintain consistent angles without any visible organic curves. This approach aligns with a stylized depiction emphasizing symmetry and geometric precision often found in artistic renditions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is illustrated with a circular shape and several radiating lines emitting from its edge, creating an effect of brightness or glow. These lines simulate light rays or halo effects and reflect an artistic enhancement that emphasizes the moon's luminescence.",

      "question": "Are the plants rendered in symmetrical, patterned arrangements instead of natural growth forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants underneath the porch appear organized and stylized, adhering to more structured shapes and patterns. However, the symmetry isn't prominent compared to other elements; they are stylized but maintain some resemblance to natural growth forms, which implies a blend rather than strict symmetry.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
