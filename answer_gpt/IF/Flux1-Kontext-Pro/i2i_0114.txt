    "Question": "Q1: Has the original desk and character structure remained unchanged?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the desk and the original characters in 'The Last Supper' appear consistent with the traditional arrangement seen in Leonardo da Vinci's work. All individuals except for the added modern man are seated around the table in their original positions and display the same gestures and attire. By examining Image A, the desk and characters are in their traditional form in the original painting, aligning with the positioning in Image B. Therefore, the primary desk and character structure are maintained while accommodating additional elements.",

    "Question": "Q2: Has a modern man been added to the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a modern man is apparent due to contemporary clothing and styling that contrasts with the historical clothing of 'The Last Supper'. This figure stands out from the rest due to his appearance, which clearly was not part of the original setup. Image A does not feature this individual, who is distinctly added to the edited version.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the modern man wearing formal attire?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man is depicted wearing a classic black tuxedo including a bow tie, which are key components of formal wear. These outfit choices signify elegance and are commonly associated with formal events and gatherings. Thus, this attire contrasts visibly with the historical attire worn by the original subjects. Image A contains no such modern figure wearing formal clothing, reaffirming that this wardrobe choice is a new addition.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the modern man raising a glass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man is caught mid-action, raising a glass, with one palm open in a typical toasting gesture that indicates celebration or recognition. His posture and arm action align with common behavior witnessed during ceremonial or festive occasions, suggesting this action wasn't originally part of the historical depiction. Image A does not contain this character or gesture, confirming an addition to the scene.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the modern man placed on the far right empty space of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man occupies a space on the furthest right of the image where previously only space without individuals existed. His placement fills an otherwise unoccupied area in 'The Last Supper,' with proportions and positioning ensuring balance in the altered image. Image A presents an open space at this location without such intrusion, indicating a strategic placement for the newly added person.",
    "answer": "Yes"
