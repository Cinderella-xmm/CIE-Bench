        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a fantastical theme is evident. The Eiffel Tower is depicted with glowing elements, particularly at the top, resembling mystical energy.

      "question": "Are the original metal lattice components replaced with enchanted vines and glowing floral motifs throughout the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the Eiffel Tower is adorned with what appear to be glowing elements that resemble vines or floral motifs. These details suggest a departure from its typical metallic lattice structure to a more enchanted, nature-infused aesthetic. The appearance of glowing patterns along the length of the tower implies the presence of these fantasy-inspired modifications.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top of the tower feature a crystal-like pinnacle instead of the original metallic spire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the Eiffel Tower prominently displays a structure that resembles a crystal with radiant light, differing from the traditional metallic spire seen on the actual Eiffel Tower. This effect, combined with the artistic portrayal of light and spectral energy, suggests a transformation into a crystal-like pinnacle.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the base of the tower been replaced with an ancient stone platform featuring engraved arcane symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the base of the Eiffel Tower retains the general form and structure typical of its original design. There is no apparent indication of an ancient stone platform with engraved arcane symbols replacing the existing elements. The changes are more focused on an ethereal glow and added decorations rather than a fundamental alteration of the base structure.",

      "question": "Does the background sky contain swirling nebulae that visually reflect the radiant glow emanating from the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features an elaborate sunset with orange hues and clouds, which enhances the fantasy aesthetic. While the sky is dramatic, it doesnâ€™t specifically depict swirling nebulae. Instead, the background complements the radiant glow of the tower rather than featuring explicit cosmic elements like nebulae.",
