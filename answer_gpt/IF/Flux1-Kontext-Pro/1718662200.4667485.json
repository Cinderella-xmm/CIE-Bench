        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is depicted in a cartoon style characterized by simplified, exaggerated features and a vivid color palette.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's head appears disproportionately larger than its body, a typical characteristic of cartoon and chibi-style art.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B does not resemble a watercolor painting; rather it is styled after a more polished and illustrative cartoon look with vivid colors. It does not display the soft, blended colors and texture typical of watercolor techniques, nor is it clearly disco-themed.",
