      "question": "Is the cityscape and car fully enclosed within a transparent, cube-shaped resin casing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and a portion of the cityscape are clearly enclosed within a transparent, cube-shaped casing, as indicated by the visible edges and corners of the cube surrounding the scene. This situation suggests a display or diorama, which matches the visual cues of containment within a transparent material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car feature a sleek, futuristic design with metallic and highly reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The car in Image B looks sleek and futuristic, with smooth, aerodynamic lines and a shiny, metallic appearance that reflects light, indicative of highly reflective surfaces. These visual characteristics align with the typical design features of a futuristic concept car.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers visibly reduced in size compared to the original image, enhancing the sense of depth and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers appear diminutive due to their context within the transparent cube, which is typically used to house miniatures. This reduction in size compared to Image A indicates an increase in depth and scale due to the perception of the car and cityscape as a smaller, contained diorama.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible points of light on the skyscrapers' windows. The buildings appear uniformly lit with no indication of distinct LED-like lighting features. This absence suggests that the skyscrapers are presented without such detailed, illuminated features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B do display detailed foliage that is miniature, which is appropriate within the context of a diorama or model. They maintain a rich green color that provides contrast against the urban structures of the cityscape, further emphasizing their detail in miniature form.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the resin cube as clear and transparent, allowing a full view of the contents inside without noticeable color distortion or opacity effects. The transparency of the resin facilitates an unobstructed view of the car and cityscape within.",
