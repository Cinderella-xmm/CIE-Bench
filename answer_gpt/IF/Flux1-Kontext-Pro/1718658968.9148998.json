      "question": "Are the surfaces of the castle composed of visible wooden puzzle pieces with natural oak and mahogany coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle exterior is clearly comprised of puzzle-like pieces with a wooden texture, exhibiting natural wood colors such as oak and mahogany. The visual cues show grain patterns typical of wooden materials, confirming the appearance of wooden puzzle pieces. Common knowledge about wooden puzzles helps identify the edges and coloration as characteristic of natural wood.",

      "question": "Does the castle retain its original architectural structure, including two towers, arched entrance, multiple windows, and connecting walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a castle maintaining its architectural integrity with two prominent towers, an arched central entrance, numerous windows, and connecting stone-like walls. Upon comparison to Image A, the structural elements are preserved, though material and setting have changed. The architectural style remains constant, demonstrating the castle's retained structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers display detailed interlocking puzzle piece patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B reveals detailed interlocking puzzle piece patterns evident at the tops of the towers, consistent with puzzle assembly. These formations reflect design features typical of wooden puzzles, with visible seams where the pieces connect, similar to observations of wooden or constructed motifs.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the castle placed on a smooth, flat wooden tabletop that serves as the new base of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B clearly shows a smooth, flat wooden surface acting as the base for the castle model. This surface likely serves as a tabletop, providing a realistic wooden setting and contrasting with Image A where a natural environment, including water, surrounded the castle.",

      "question": "Are the wooden components of the castle visibly segmented into individual puzzle-like pieces with defined edges and joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle is visually segmented into puzzle-like components, characterized by well-defined edges and joints typical of wooden puzzle pieces. This segmentation is apparent through the tiny gaps and distinct borders that align regularly across the structure, indicating puzzle assembly definitions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no reflective water. Instead, the castle stands on a completely flat, wooden tabletop, as identified by the grain and texture indicative of wood, providing a dry setting unlike the natural water mirror present in Image A.",
