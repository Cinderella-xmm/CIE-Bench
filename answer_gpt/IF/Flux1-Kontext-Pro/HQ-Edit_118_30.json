      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the train cars depicted as large, colorful, interlocking blocks rather than realistic carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train cars appear as traditional train carriages with realistic features like windows and doors painted in consistent colors, similar to classic trains. There is no indication that they have been altered into large, colorful, interlocking blocks. This type of depiction suggests a realistic style rather than a stylized block representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the train rendered as swirling white forms instead of a realistic cloud of steam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke from the train is depicted as a cloud of steam, similar to how it would appear in reality. The formation is puffy and consistent with typical steam emissions from a train, rather than being stylized as swirling white forms.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the countryside landscape been converted into various geometric patterns such as grids, polygons, or angular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countryside landscape maintains its natural appearance, characterized by rolling hills, fields, and other realistic topographical features. There is no indication that it has been converted into geometric patterns like grids or angular shapes. The fields, while perhaps having straight edges in some areas, maintain an organic, pastoral aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with small puzzle pieces showing individuals in vintage clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures remain intact and appear as individuals dressed in vintage clothing, suggesting an historical setting. They are not replaced with puzzle pieces, but rather, they are integral parts of the image, contributing to the cohesive scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire puzzle scene placed on a light-colored wooden tabletop with visible grain and edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the scene with visible puzzle-piece borders and seems to rest on a light-colored wooden surface. The background of the image shows a clear tabletop texture with grain and edges, which contrasts with the image itself, indicating that the assembled puzzle is placed on this surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible interlocking edges, seams, or puzzle-piece borders throughout the scene indicating a complex, assembled structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features visible interlocking edges and seams across the image, distinctly showing the individual puzzle pieces and indicating that the overall scene is assembled from multiple pieces. This detail suggests a puzzle format rather than a singular, cohesive image without breaks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
