    "Question": "Q1: Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the timer is located on the left parking meter does not show the usual timer markings. Instead, there is a visual element that resembles a dog's ears, part of a face and is blurred, indicating a change from the standard timer. This suggests the possibility of an illustration, but without detailing it as a robotic dog.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the robotic dog clearly shown holding a coin in its paws?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual element present does not clearly depict a robotic dog holding a coin. There are no distinct features shown that suggest a coin being held by a robotic entity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the parking meter still display billing information such as numbers and labels in a legible manner?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows that the right parking meter still has clear digits and labels, like '1995', displayed legibly. This indicates that despite changes in other areas, the billing information remains intact and readable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the overall shape and structure of the parking meter remained consistent with the original design?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, we notice that the shape and general structural features, such as the dome-like top and body containing slots and displays, remain similar to typical parking meters and consistent with Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the robotic dog designed with features such as metallic textures or mechanical parts, making it identifiable as a robot?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the part believed to be an illustration isn't distinctly showing metallic textures or mechanical features. This absence of definitive robotic characteristics prevents the identification of the dog as robotic.",
    "answer": "No"
