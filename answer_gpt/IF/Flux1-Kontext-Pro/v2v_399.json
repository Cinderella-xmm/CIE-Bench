      "question": "Has the vase been replaced with a structure composed entirely of flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is clearly visible as a detailed metallic structure on the right side and has not been replaced by flowers. The left side shows a separate floral arrangement in a pot, causing no merging or replacement of the vase with flowers. Thus, the vase remains intact and is not replaced by a floral structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral details follow and blend with the contours of the vase's original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the floral arrangement stands separately in a pot and does not merge or follow the contours of the vase's shape. The vase retains its original form and design details, and the flowers appear as a distinct arrangement beside it. Therefore, the floral elements do not blend with the vase's contours.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the design prioritize artistic and imaginative expression over functional realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a beautiful juxtaposition of an intricately designed vase and an artful floral arrangement. The focus appears more on showcasing artistic aesthetics through the vivid red flowers and detailed engravings on the vase, rather than functional realism in the context of traditional use objects designed for utility purposes. The artistic expression is evident in the ornate details and the vibrant contrast between elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the final design present a unique and innovative interpretation rather than a conventional vase appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the vase with intricate engravings, showcasing the artistry and craftsmanship. While the floral arrangement is a separate entity, combining the two aesthetically offers a unique impression through visual richness rather than just a typical vase form. The use of ornate details and vivid flower colors emphasizes creativity, making the presentation unique in juxtaposition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed vase retain the original shape and structure while being composed of flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is distinctly visible, retaining its original shape and metallic structure. The flowers are in a separate pot, not composing or taking over the vase's form in any capacity. Thus, the vase's original shape and structure are unchanged, reflecting its intricate engravings without being transformed into flowers.",
