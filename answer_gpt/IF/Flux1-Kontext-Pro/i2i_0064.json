        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is clearly wearing a pair of black glasses. This can be identified by the distinctive frame sitting on its face, which is not a natural part of a cat's appearance. The addition of glasses is a common humorous or anthropomorphic edit to give the cat a more 'human-like' appearance.",

      "question": "Is the cat lounging on a sofa in a human-like posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat seated in a manner typical of a human relaxing on a sofa, with its back against the couch and front legs stretched in front similar to how a person would place their feet while sitting comfortably. This posture is decidedly anthropomorphic for an animal, which normally would not sit in such a position.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is clearly holding a remote control in its paw. Additionally, there is a TV set visible in the foreground, suggesting the setting is one where watching television is typical. These elements combined are indicative of a typical human activity scene where someone watches television using a remote control.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a couch, a coffee table, and a TV, all elements consistent with a living room setup. This background choice gives a familiar and domestic atmosphere associated with lounging activities common in a living room. The setup supports the narrative of a human-like setting for the cat.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the anthropomorphic posture and added accessories like glasses and a remote control, the cat maintains its natural fur pattern and retains the bell collar. The head and body, excluding modifications, appear to keep the same physical characteristics as typically expected in a domestic cat.",
