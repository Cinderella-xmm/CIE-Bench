      "question": "Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container is indeed cylindrical, which contrasts with the rounded form of the teapot in Image A. Drawing from visual information, a cylindrical shape typically appears as a vertical structure with a flat top and bottom, which aligns with the container's features in Image B. Comparing that to the teapot's rounded shape in Image A, characterized by its pot-like curvature, confirms the change in shape.",

      "question": "Are floral patterns embossed in golden foil on the surface of the teapot container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the container in Image B, it features a bamboo motif rather than floral patterns and does not appear to have embossing in golden foil. In comparison, Image A shows clear floral patterns on the teapot itself with no indication of foil embossing. Thus, based on visual inspection and understanding of patterns and surface finishes, Image B does not have floral designs or golden foil embossing.",

      "question": "Are the teacups redesigned as nested stackable units, each with a decorative lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teacups are visible as stackable units without any decorative lids present. The design allows the cups to be stacked into one another, which is evident from their arrangement. Image A, however, shows teacups placed individually and does not show any stackable feature or lids, reinforcing that there is no redesign involving lids.",

      "question": "Is there Japanese calligraphy displayed across the top of the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents Japanese calligraphy prominently displayed on the cylindrical container. The presence of characters is discernible, indicating the use and significance of this text. Image A does not feature any Japanese calligraphy on the teapot, which confirms that Image B includes such a design choice.",

      "question": "Is a bamboo motif visible along the side of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bamboo motif is clearly visible on the cylindrical container in Image B, emphasizing a traditional design element often associated with Asian themes. Image A lacks any such bamboo motifs, emphasizing floral designs instead, which illustrate the packaging motif changes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tea set placed on a flat white surface devoid of any additional background elements. The clean, minimalistic presentation is noticeable. Image A, however, features a tea setup on a textured mat with a wooden backdrop, clearly different from the presentation seen in Image B.",
