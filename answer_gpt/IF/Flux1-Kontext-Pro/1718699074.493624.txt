    "Question": "Q1: Has the central structure been replaced with a digital billboard featuring luminous panels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure lacks any clear indication of being a digital billboard or luminous panels. The object has distinct geometric shapes, but no components that suggest functionality or illumination typical of digital billboards. Therefore, the analysis of Image B shows no sign of such transformation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible dynamic neon animations on the digital billboard surface?",
    "explanation": "Analysis of Image B does not show any surface of the central structure exhibiting dynamic neon animations typically associated with digital billboards. The depiction is static with no apparent motion or transformative neon elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the natural overgrowth been replaced with synthetic, glowing foliage?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the surroundings of the central structure exhibit plants with visible glowing effects. This suggests a transformation from natural to synthetic foliage in the edited version.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original architectural angles and structural geometry preserved in the transformed structure?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing both images, the structural geometry and angles of the central structure appear consistent between Image A and Image B, indicating preservation of the original design despite different visual overlays.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the surrounding buildings feature metallic facades and visible augmented reality elements such as holograms or digital overlays?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings surrounding the central structure show elements that reflect metallic surfaces with overlays suggesting digital enhancements. This indicates the presence of augmented reality features in the modified environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
