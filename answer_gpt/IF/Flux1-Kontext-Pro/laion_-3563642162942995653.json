    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck appears to be made of a transparent material that resembles crystal. The reflective nature and greenish tint give it an appearance similar to emerald or jade. The visual cues suggest this based on the shimmering and transparent qualities as observed around the cabin and body of the truck.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the wheels are indeed transparent and have a texture that resembles that of crystal or quartz. The transparency allows visibility of what appears to be internal crystalline patterns, consistent with characteristics of quartz.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck placed on a smooth, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The truck in Image B is clearly positioned on a platform that visually corresponds to white marble. This is identifiable by its smooth surface and the distinct veining pattern typical of marble.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the cabin and body of the truck demonstrate angular and faceted surfaces typical in crystal structures, which contribute to reflections and light refraction. This is evident in the way light interacts with these surfaces, lending them an intricate and lustrous appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the structural proportions and layout in Image B with Image A, the crystal truck has faithfully replicated the design and proportions of the original military truck. Key parts like the cabin shape, wheel arrangement, and the overall structure have been preserved, indicating consistency in design between the two images.",
