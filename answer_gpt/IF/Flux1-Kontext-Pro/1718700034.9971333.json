      "question": "Are the wings replaced with large, angular crystal shards in shades of opal and white?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings appear to be made of a solid material with distinct segments resembling feathers rather than angular crystal shards. They maintain the natural shape and structure of typical wings used in angelic depictions, which does not align with the description of crystal shards. Therefore, the wings are not replaced with large, angular crystal shards of opal and white shades.",

      "question": "Is the hair replaced with golden, leafy strands woven into a crown-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair remains natural and appears to be styled in loose, wavy strands, maintaining a blonde color. There is a crown-like structure present, but it is a jeweled tiara, not leafy strands. Therefore, the hair has not been replaced with golden, leafy strands.",

      "question": "Has the shirt been changed to a smooth velvet material while maintaining a white color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt still appears to be made of a simple, soft fabric like cotton or a similar material. There is no indication of the texture or sheen typical of velvet visible in the image. While the shirt remains white, the material does not seem to have changed to velvet.",

      "question": "Is the background a plain, deep gray wall with no visible objects or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed a plain gray wall with a deep tone, and it does not show any visible objects or additional textures. This description matches the condition of the background being a plain gray wall.",

      "question": "Has the figureâ€™s facial expression, posture, and positioning remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess this, we consider Image A. The figure in both Image A and Image B is standing in a similar posture with shoulders at the same angle and the body facing forward. Given the consistency in wing placement and overall body stance, the figure has maintained the same posture and positioning, though the facial expression cannot be judged here.",
