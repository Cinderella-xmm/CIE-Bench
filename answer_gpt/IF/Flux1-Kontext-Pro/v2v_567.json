        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals at the train station appear to have a stylized appearance characteristic of chibi, which typically includes exaggerated features, such as large heads and smaller bodies. This suggests a transformation into 3D chibi-style characters, combining the visual cues with knowledge about what chibi representations usually look like. The change in proportions and stylization is clear, indicating they have been converted.",
