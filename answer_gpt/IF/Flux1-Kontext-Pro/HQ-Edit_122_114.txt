    "Question": "Q1: Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a stork whose feathers appear to be replaced with metallic plates, displaying a texture reminiscent of segmented metal. The reflective and structured nature of the feathers suggests they are metal rather than natural plumage. This conclusion is drawn from the shine and texture characteristic of metal surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
    "explanation": "The nest in Image B incorporates various cogs, gears, and mechanical elements scattered among traditional twig-like materials. Although mechanical parts are visible, the nest is not entirely composed of them, as natural twig-like structures are still prevalent. The visual balance suggests a mixed composition rather than a full replacement.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is the presence of copper-colored components like the chimney and other pipe-like elements along the house's structure, suggesting such integration. The color and form are characteristic of copper, aligning with the aesthetic shift towards mechanical features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a stork with limbs and features that do not visibly display mechanical joints. The structure of the stork's limbs and body appears natural in terms of articulation, lacking overt mechanical features at key limb connections.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
    "explanation": "While Image B introduces Steampunk elements, such as metallic feathers and copper components, the scene does not fully embody the Steampunk style throughout. The presence of natural materials like twigs and the traditional rustic wood aesthetic of the house suggests a blend, rather than a complete stylistic shift. The consistency is partial, indicating a partial transition.",
    "answer": "No"
