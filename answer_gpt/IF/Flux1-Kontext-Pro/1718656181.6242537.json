    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the explosion depicted as a mural painted on a beach wall, rather than occurring naturally in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a vibrant and colorful explosion reminiscent of a mural painted on a wall. The background is uniform, resembling a wall texture, and the explosion is framed in a way typical of wall art. Such characteristics suggest that it's not a real-life scene but an artistic representation on a wall.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the explosion and surrounding elements bright and neon-like, consistent with pop art aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion and surrounding elements are filled with bright, vibrant colors such as pinks, blues, yellows, and purples. These colors are characteristic of the bold and eye-catching palette often used in pop art, which seeks to create visual impact through neon-like saturation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all major elements (explosion, clouds, palm trees, landforms) have thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, careful examination reveals that all key elements like the explosion, clouds, palm trees, and landforms are delineated with thick black outlines, making them stand out distinctly. This outlining technique is commonly used in pop art to emphasize shapes and create contrast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the palm trees stylized with exaggerated forms and bold outlines, consistent with pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees appear with exaggerated forms and bold outlines. Their representation is less about realism and more about stylization, which is in keeping with the pop art style known for its playful and bold aesthetic choices.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are geometric patterns (e.g., stripes, grids, polygons) visibly embedded within the cloud formations of the explosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud formations are filled with solid colors and gradients but lack any visible geometric patterns such as stripes, grids, or polygons embedded within them. The patterns are more abstract and don't include distinct geometric shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the island landscape been transformed into simplified abstract shapes, lacking realistic terrain details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island landscape is represented in a highly stylized and simplified manner, with abstract shapes dominating the design. The focus is on bold forms and colors rather than intricate and realistic terrain details, typical of an abstract pop art approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
