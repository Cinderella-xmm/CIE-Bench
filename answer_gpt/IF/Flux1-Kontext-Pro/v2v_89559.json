      "question": "Have the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos been transformed into stylized, gleaming golden award statuettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logos 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' have indeed been transformed into 3D golden statuettes, visually resembling award trophies. This conclusion is drawn from their striking golden hue, lustrous surface, and the physical depth that indicates they are no longer simple 2D logos.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been changed to a rich, dark velvet curtain, replacing the original green background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a rich, dark velvet curtain as the background, identifiable by its texture and deep color, which stands in contrast to the flat, vibrant green geometric background seen in Image A. This change indicates a more dramatic and luxurious setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 'Sumo Digital' logo rendered as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the 'Sumo Digital' logo on a block that appears to be a polished wooden plaque, distinguished by its brown color, glossy texture, and the raised design of the logo, suggesting it is embossed. This is a significant shift from Image A, where the logo is part of the flat graphics of the logo designs.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text presented in elegant, engraved silver lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Character Art Directory 2018' is displayed at the bottom of the image using an elegant font, characteristic of engraved lettering. However, the color appears more white than silver and does not reflect the shininess typically associated with silver, unlike what the question suggests.",

    {

      "question": "Has the structural integrity of the original image been maintained while applying the specified changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structural arrangement of elements from Image A, such as the logos and text positioning, has changed significantly in Image B, where logos are now 3D statuettes and the text is at the bottom. These modifications change the layout and presentation style, indicating that the original structural integrity has not been maintained.",
