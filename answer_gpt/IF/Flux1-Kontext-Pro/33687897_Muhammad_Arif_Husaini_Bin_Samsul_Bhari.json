      "question": "Has the mountain been transformed into a colossal mythical creature with distinct features such as a head, wings, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain has been creatively transformed into a mythical creature with clearly distinct features. The visual depiction includes a large head, massive wings, and prominent limbs, which strongly suggest the portrayal of a fictional entity rather than a natural mountain formation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the mythical creature exhibit a stone-like texture throughout its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has a texture on its surface that resembles stone, giving it an ancient and monumental appearance.

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the peak of the mountain clearly shaped and stylized as the head of the creature, including rock-carved eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peak of the mountain is distinctly stylized into the head of the creature, complete with features such as eyes carved from the rock. This transformation is a common artistic technique used to impart life-like characteristics to geological formations in fantasy settings.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Do the ridges of the mountain extend outward into large, wing-like structures that appear to be part of the creature’s anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ridges in Image B extend outward and are transformed into large wings, integrated into the anatomy of the creature. This creative extension gives the creature an imposing and majestic appearance as would be typical for mythical winged entities.",

    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roots are not merely depicted as natural extensions but are dramatically transformed into limb-like structures. However, these limb-like structures are not visibly intertwined with the silhouettes of the foreground trees; they seem to exist separately.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has luminous vein-like patterns running across the creature's body, emitting a distinct glow which enhances its mythical essence. These lights are predominantly blue, complementing the creature's stone-like appearance and adding to the fantasy aspect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the silhouetted trees in the foreground still present and visible, with the creature’s limbs integrated among them?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouetted trees are visible in both images. However, in Image B, these trees are not integrated with the creature’s limbs; the limbs are distinctly part of the creature’s design and do not merge with the foreground elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the misty layer at the base of the mountain still present, contributing to a hazy effect beneath the creature?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the misty layer at the base of the mountain as seen in Image A. The transformation into a mythical creature does not include a representation of mist or haze at the base, as the focus is on the creature's majestic and clear form.",
