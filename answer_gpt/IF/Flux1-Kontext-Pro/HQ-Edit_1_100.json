    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible calendar layout element (such as a date, month, or decorative border) indicating the image is formatted as an art calendar page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a black border around the central image, which is commonly seen in calendar or poster layouts. The border and the stylized illustration combined can suggest the format of an art calendar page. However, there are no visible dates or months directly present. Given the visual cue and understanding of design elements, it is reasonable to conclude it is presented in a calendar style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure exhibit characteristics of a half-cartoon style, such as stylized facial features, smooth lines, or exaggerated proportions while maintaining realism in other areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a stylized representation typical of a half-cartoon style. The lines are bold, the clothing and hands are simplified compared to realistic rendering, and the textures are less detailed, similar to a cartoon. Elements like the smooth, exaggerated lines and simplified detail are key indicators of a half-cartoon style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the book in the foreground visibly longer than a normal book, with an elongated shape that exceeds typical proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing the edited image (Image B), the book's proportions appear exaggerated due to the stylized rendering. The elongated shape with emphasized exaggerated perspective lines makes it appear longer than realistic proportions. This elongation is consistent with the artistic style used.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) includes sleeves that have stylized curve lines implying drapery and gentle folds. Although the detail is less than realistic due to the art style, the soft curvature provides a sense of texture and movement usually associated with this kind of artistic depiction of fabric.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) portrays shelves that curve around the composition, with the artistic rendition adding to the wooden frame aesthetic.
