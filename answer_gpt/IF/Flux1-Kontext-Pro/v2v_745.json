      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the backgrounds of all stickers transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background appears to be a continuous neutral color that contrasts with the stickers themselves, indicating that the stickers are not placed against a transparent background. Typically, stickers are observed alongside their white or transparent backgrounds, meaning all items here seem to be placed without a distinguished transparent backdrop.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stickers arranged in a 3x3 grid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visually assessing the arrangement reveals them organized in a 2x3 formation—two rows containing three stickers each, rather than three rows of three stickers which would form a 3x3 grid.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all stickers have a square 1:1 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker’s aspect ratio is consistent, all being rectangular rather than square. This aspect is distinguishable as a sticker's border takes on a form closely aligned to the figure itself rather than being shaped into a square.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers each portray various characters in a Chibi style, characterized by small bodies, oversized heads, and rounded features. This is a hallmark in Japanese animation aesthetics, similar to Studio Ghibli’s lively and vibrant color use, which is consistently present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Every sticker visually signals travel or exploration themes, such as carrying bags or looking at maps, each representing distinct actions or preparations related to travel. This thematic expression via stickers shows a coherent travel motif.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all characters in the stickers fully depicted without any missing features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each character is fully rendered with all essential elements such as limbs, clothing, and accessories indicating completeness in their depiction. These stickers typically focus on showcasing full character traits including fine details such as clothing and expressions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A uniform white border outlines each sticker consistently. This is commonplace in sticker designs to visually define their edges and make each individual sticker stand out distinctly from neutral backgrounds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there any disconnected or unrelated elements within the stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The stickers illustrate cohesive elements pertinent to the character's current action or situational theme, such as traveling. There aren’t any irrelevant pieces; each sticker maintains a uniform thematic aspect and styling.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "There is text observed in one sticker as part of a ticket, which seems accurately represented within its role fitting within the travel theme. The presence of text appears purposeful and correctly displays the intended content with clarity.",
