      "question": "Is the Blue Jay rendered as a miniature sculpture made of a solid material such as ceramic or metal, rather than a live bird?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Blue Jay appears to be a meticulously crafted sculpture rather than a live bird. Its glossy surface and the lack of movement, coupled with the posed nature and polished appearance, suggest it is made of a solid material like ceramic or metal. Commonly, bird sculptures are made using these materials for stability and aesthetic appeal in displays such as terrariums or home decor.",
