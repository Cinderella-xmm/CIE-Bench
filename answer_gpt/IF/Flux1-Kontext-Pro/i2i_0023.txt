{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the boy and all bird outlines clearly present in the illustration?",

}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have block colors been used for the boy's skin tones and the birds' feathers?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows block colors applied uniformly across the boy's skin tones and birds' feathers. This technique is typical in flat illustrations where textures are minimized in favor of solid color fills.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background completely removed from the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a stark black background, contrasting with the original Image A where the background is a realistic indoor setting. The removal of the detailed background from Image A suggests an intentional simplification in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q5: Has the boyâ€™s head been slightly enlarged and the birds shrunk to achieve a neatly arranged composition?",
    "explanation": "Upon comparison between Image A and Image B, there is no apparent intentional resizing of the boy's head or birds to affect composition. Image B retains similar proportions to those in Image A regarding the relative sizes of the boy and birds.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Has a thick white outline been added around the boy and birds?",
