        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are variations of refrigerator views depicted; however, it lacks a clear left side view and detailed top views. It's composed mostly of front views of both single and dual refrigerators. The fourth image shows a top view orientation while not explicitly being labeled as such. Based on world knowledge and observation, the commonly expected perspectives for comprehensive product display would include consistent and distinguishable views, such as front, side, and top. Therefore, the edited image does not cover the required orientations distinctly.",
