      "question": "Is the individual depicted within a Funko Pop figure box in an isometric perspective?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the box is displayed in a three-dimensional manner which suggests that it is shown in an isometric perspective. This is commonly utilized to give a sense of depth and prominence to the packaging. The angled view of the box allows observers to see both the front and one side at the same time, characteristic of isometric presentation.",
