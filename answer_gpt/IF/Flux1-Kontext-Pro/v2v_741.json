      "question": "Is the notebook depicted as a kawaii, moe-inspired anthropomorphic anime girl wearing purple and white attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the notebook is shown with the character sitting in front of it wearing purple and white clothes, suggesting an alignment with the notebook colors. The notebook itself is not depicted as an anthropomorphic figure; it is a regular notebook with markings. Therefore, it is not depicted as a kawaii, moe-inspired anthropomorphic anime girl.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 1 features a speech bubble containing the message 'Why won’t you connect?! I followed the documentation!!' However, the text is not in a casual handwritten font; it appears in a standard comic text format. The emoticon ‘(；´д｀)’ is not present.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, Panel 2 shows the same desk, but does not necessarily appear cleaner. The code on the screens does not 'glow' or exhibit any kind of animated effect like cascading. The setting and items remain consistent without perceptible changes from Panel 1.",
