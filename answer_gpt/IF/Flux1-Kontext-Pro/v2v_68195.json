      "question": "Are there delicate embroidered motifs of miniature corn cobs and autumn leaves around the gathered waistline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible motifs around the bottom of the dress, consisting of corn cobs and autumn leaves in golden and red colors. These motifs appear embroidered and add decorative detail reminiscent of fall themes. Such imagery is not present in Image A, where the lower portion of the dress is plain red. The addition of these motifs in Image B represents an enhancement in the design, likely to symbolize the agricultural heritage associated with Nebraska.",

      "question": "Has the red fabric been deepened to a rich crimson?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dress fabric in a darker, richer shade of red compared to Image A. Initially, Image A depicts a brighter, more typical red color. The darker, richer color in Image B signifies the adjustment to a more crimson or mature red, which may have been intended to give a more luxurious or festive appearance. The reasoning comes from comparing the two shades and recognizing the shift in hue and depth.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When observing Image B, the gingham pattern on the cuffs and back bow appear sharp, with distinct red and white checks, maintaining a festive appearance typical of such patterns. Based on the visual cues in Image B alone, the gingham accents still display the characteristics of a crisp and festive design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the gingham pattern on both the cuffs and the back bow appears to be consistent with each other, maintaining the same red and white check design. There is no noticeable change in the pattern or color between the two images, suggesting that this aspect of the dress design has remained static.",
