      "question": "Are the armrests of the sofa transformed into curled horn-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests retain a similar shape to their original state, resembling traditional rolled armrests rather than horn-like structures. The addition of green moss does not transform them into horns, maintaining their rolled characteristic seen in classic leather sofas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tufted patterns are still visible on the sofa’s surface. They appear adjusted by adding green moss but do not resemble bark-textured scales. The patterns are covered yet remain consistent with a traditional tufted design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cushions are covered with a green, fuzzy texture that resembles moss and leaves. This gives them the appearance of a mane-like structure, significantly differing from the plain leather cushions in Image A.",

        "No"
      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, apart from the glowing eyes, there aren’t other indications of mythical energy like ethereal particles or a mystical aura integrated into the surface. The main changes are physical alterations rather than subtle energies.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the addition of fantasy elements like moss, glowing eyes, and claws, the overall shape and positioning of the sofa in Image B are consistent with Image A. The structure and alignment remain the same, with only cosmetic modifications.",
