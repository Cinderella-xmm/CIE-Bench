    "Question": "Q1: Is the figure rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified features and stylized lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure exhibits characteristics typical of a semi-cartoon style, such as simplified features and stylized lines. The stylization is evident in the less detailed and more illustrative approach to the robe and the overall design, which contrast with realistic features usually found in a photograph. This style tends to emphasize artistic representation over realistic detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the textile patterns on the robe enhanced with visible gold leaf accents?",
    "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, the robeâ€™s patterns include gold-colored areas, which are stylized, and it appears these are created using flat colors rather than actual gold leaf accents. Traditional gold leaf accents usually have a reflective quality, which isn't discernible in the edited image's illustrative style.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the hands visibly enlarged compared to their original size in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands appear proportionate and consistent with the overall semi-cartoon style of the illustration. They do not seem disproportionately large compared to the original image, where the hands are also realistic in size and proportion. Both images maintain the same proportions for hand size relative to the body.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the image have a deep indigo border framing the entire composition?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a deep indigo border that frames the composition, contributing to its stylized, illustrative appearance. This border is absent in Image A, where the background appears more neutral without any framing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there subtle, hand-drawn floral outlines extending from the robe into the frame?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes hand-drawn floral designs that extend from the robe into the surrounding frame. These outlines are characteristic of illustrative renderings where the art extends beyond the primary subject to interact with the frame, adding a decorative element that is not present in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
