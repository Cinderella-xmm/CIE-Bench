    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a soft, flattened art postcard style with reduced realism and enhanced serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are softer, the lines are less defined, and the overall ambiance evokes a serene and calming atmosphere, typical of a postcard style. The image appears more illustrated than real, indicating a shift from the realism of Image A to a more artistic and serene presentation in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the woman’s figure exhibit visible watercolor characteristics such as translucent washes, soft blending, and brushstroke textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's figure is portrayed with translucent and softly blended colors, which are characteristic of watercolor paintings. This is in contrast to Image A, which showcases a sharp and detailed photographic depiction. The use of brushlike textures further implies the watercolor technique in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the drapes of the woman’s robe visibly elongated compared to their original length in the source image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe appears to maintain proportions similar to those in Image A, without noticeable elongation. The length and drape seem consistent between both images, so the robe's depiction does not show the drapes as elongated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the robe feature visible botanical patterns such as leaves, flowers, or vines woven into its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe is presented with a consistent solid color, similar to Image A, without any additional patterns or botanical designs such as leaves, flowers, or vines. The lack of such patterns suggests that the design remains unaltered in terms of botanical decor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible rays of sunlight filtering through tree leaves, creating dappled lighting effects on the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a more uniform application of color and has an illustrative quality that does not incorporate the realistic depiction of sunlight filtering and creating dappled effects, unlike the photographic style of Image A where this effect could be represented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Have the words on the open book been replaced with leaf-shaped outlines while preserving the general text layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible content of the open book includes leaf-shaped outlines rather than text. This artistic alteration replaces the typical lines of text while maintaining the overall placement as if the book were filled with writing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a muted-colored border surrounding the entire image, consistent with a postcard format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a border surrounding the image; instead, it is fully filled with the illustration extending to the edges, differing from a postcard style, which often includes a defined border.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there subtle literary motifs such as small book icons, feathers, or script elements incorporated into the border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B lacks any border as mentioned previously, there are no incorporated motifs like book icons, feathers, or script elements within a border context. The image focuses solely on the central illustration without additional border elements.",
