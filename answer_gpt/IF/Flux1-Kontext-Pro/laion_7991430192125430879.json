    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is a realistic representation of a Bacardi Mojito bottle, with features typical of glass or plastic materials. This is evident from the smooth surface, typical reflective properties of glass or plastic, and detailed label similar to conventional bottles. Thus, it does not exhibit characteristics of LEGO construction, which would show noticeable blocky structures and connections between bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle with a translucent green hue, synonymous with glass material, where the green appears as a tint rather than a result of individual LEGO bricks. LEGO constructions would usually show discernible lines where bricks meet, which is not visible here. Hence, the bottle's material seems more glass-like than block-formed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the label area composed of multicolored LEGO blocks representing the original design elements (logo, text, colors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly features the label with printed text, logo, and design elements typical to alcoholic beverage bottles. The label is smooth and printed on the bottle as you would expect in typical production, without blocky LEGO construction. Multicolored LEGO blocks would not produce such a continuous and smooth label appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cap made from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks and does it maintain a cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B is green and has the typical screw-cap form seen on bottles, which maintains a cylindrical shape. Smooth, circular LEGO bricks would have visible seams and knobs characteristic of LEGO, which are absent in this image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral or white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle appears on a white background, but the image lacks contextual shelving, typically seen as furniture or supportive surface under objects in display. The minimalist effect comes from the isolated product shot rather than placement on a shelf.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all brand texts (e.g., \"Bacardi,\" \"Mojito,\" \"Classic Cocktails\") visibly rendered in blocky LEGO-style lettering and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand texts in Image B are printed smoothly and with typical typography as seen on commercial products, legible and not appearing in blocky LEGO-style lettering which would be made from individual LEGO bricks with visible segmentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bottle display clear sculptural features such as defined edges, depth, and 3D form to emphasize its construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a sculpturally detailed bottle, but the surface, edges, and depth are typical of a realistic glass/plastic bottle. LEGO construction would show defined edges made from rectangular or round bricks in discernible sections, which are not present here.",
