    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered as a bronze sculpture with a metallic surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire figure appears to be coated in a uniform bronze color that gives it a metallic look. This suggests that the figure is rendered as a bronze sculpture. The shiny surface and consistent bronze tone typically indicate a metallic finish.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs visibly elongated compared to natural human proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the sculpture appear slender and proportionate relative to typical human dimensions. They do not seem unusually stretched or elongated compared to a realistic human form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the legs form smooth, curved shapes that suggest dynamic movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B are sculpted in a graceful and fluid pose, with curves that convey a sense of motion. The positioning of the legs, along with the overall posture of the figure, suggests dynamic movement.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible floral elements present on the sculpture. Instead, the figure maintains artistic details without the inclusion of geometric patterns often seen in Art Deco design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is rendered entirely in a bronze metallic tone. The original color scheme of teal, red, and pink is not preserved; instead, everything is given a uniform bronze color.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Are the adornments on the figure composed of symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typical of Art Deco style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the adornments visible on the sculpture do not display distinct symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typically associated with the Art Deco style. The design remains focused on the bronze aesthetic rather than incorporating such motifs.",
