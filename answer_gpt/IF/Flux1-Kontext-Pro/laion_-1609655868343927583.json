      "question": "Is the marble top replaced by a crown-shaped structure with visible gemstone inlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the cabinet has been replaced by a crown-like structure, which incorporates visible gemstone inlays, suggesting a regal and ornate style. This change is indicative of a transformation from a furniture piece to an anthropomorphic figure with royal elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the cabinet’s body been replaced with a fabric-like, patterned robe design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a fabric-like robe, the body of the cabinet appears transformed into a series of armor-like elements with intricate patterns, resembling protective gear rather than a robe. Thus, the description does not match a patterned robe design change.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawers retain their ornamental engravings, but they have not been transformed into belt buckles. They are still depicted as drawers in the midsection of the figure, suggesting a continuation of the cabinet-like features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly presents the legs of the cabinet as transformed into clawed feet, which resemble the lower extremities of a warrior figure or a noble creature. This transformation aligns with creating an anthropomorphic and regal appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drawers maintain their original form as cabinet drawers and do not resemble openable pouches in Image B. They are visually integrated into the figure but do not clearly mimic adventurer-style gear.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a figure that has been transformed with a crown on the head, clawed feet, and armor-like elements rather than a robe. This signifies an anthropomorphic design derived from the original cabinet, combining the cabinet's structural form with warrior-like attributes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the materials and textures consistent with royal or adventurer attire (e.g., fabric, gemstones, metal, leather)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials and textures in Image B show a mix of gemstones, metal, and armor-like design features, aligning more closely with royal attire rather than adventurer gear. The presence of detailed engravings and gem inlays enhances the regal motif.",
