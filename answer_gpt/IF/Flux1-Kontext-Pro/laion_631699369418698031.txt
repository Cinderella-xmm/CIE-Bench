    "Question": "Q1: Is the totem pole now presented as a miniature scene within a confined space, suggesting a scaled-down 3D environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the totem pole is enclosed within a glass dome, which suggests that it is a miniature representation, as glass domes are typically used for displaying and protecting small objects. The presence of relatively large plant elements, like the ferns and moss at the base, further reinforces the idea that this is a scaled-down environment.",
