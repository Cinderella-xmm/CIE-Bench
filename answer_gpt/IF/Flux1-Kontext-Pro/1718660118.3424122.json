      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is seated with both hands resting on the throne's armrests, and the body posture appears upright. This indicates a similar seating pose to that in Image A, where the figure also has both hands on the armrests and is sitting upright.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outfit in Image B features visible brass components and mechanical embellishments such as buttons and decorative elements on the jacket that resemble Victorian style, which incorporates such details.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is enhanced with elements that resemble mechanical structures, such as cogwheels and rivet-like details, which differ from the original simple throne in Image A.
