      "question": "Are the horse and elephant depicted as chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse and elephant appear simplified and stylized, characteristic of chibi-style models which often feature exaggerated and cute features. The proportions and exaggerated aspects, such as a smooth, almost cartoonish surface give them a 3D model look that aligns with common chibi-style representations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the horse still standing on the elephant's back in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visually, the horse is positioned on the back of the elephant, consistent with the original image's layout. This positioning is clearly observable and suggests that the scenario has not changed in this particular aspect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background feature a photorealistic grassy field and sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a grassy field and a sky with clouds. However, the level of detail and style might be less photorealistic and more cohesive with the stylized appearance of the animals. Despite this artistic rendering, the key elements of grass and sky are present, maintaining the essence of a landscape.",

      "question": "Is the scene displayed within an ornate photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the scene within a wooden frame, which has detailed carvings. The presence of such a frame surrounding the scene distinguishes it as being framed in a specific aesthetic style, described as ornate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Are the horse and elephant rendered as 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse and elephant have a smooth, sculpted appearance typical of 3D rendering. Their lack of texture detail and uniformity in shape and surface finish indicates that they are depicted as 3D models rather than photographs. This aligns with the typical characteristics of rendered 3D models.",
