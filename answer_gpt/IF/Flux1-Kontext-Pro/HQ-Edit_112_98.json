      "question": "Has the sparrow been transformed into an ethereal blossom spirit with a non-realistic, floral appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature possesses features that are beyond realistic for a sparrow. These include antler-like branches on its head and glowing green eyes, which are not attributes of ordinary birds. The feathers resemble flower petals, suggesting a transformation to an ethereal blossom spirit, emphasizing a non-realistic, floral appearance. Image A shows a regular sparrow with typical bird features, no indication of any spiritual or floral transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bird's feathers replaced with petal-like structures that have a soft pink gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers are indeed transformed into petal-like structures, with a discernible soft pink gradient, resembling cherry blossom petals. This is consistent with a transformation into a floral, ethereal creature. Image A depicts the sparrow with typical bird feathers, highlighting the clear distinction from petal-like structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there distinct blossom patterns visible along the wings of the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B feature structures which suggest a layering of petals, resembling blossom patterns. While not explicit flower shapes, the arrangement and color gradient of the petals give the impression of floral elements integrated into the wings. In Image A, the wings consist of regular feathers without any floral patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bird's eyes appear as glowing emerald-green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the bird with striking emerald-green eyes that appear to glow, adding to its ethereal and mystical presentation. This eye color is extraordinary when compared to regular bird eyes, which are seen in Image A with a standard brown coloration, providing a stark contrast.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the tail been replaced with cascading cherry blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail retains a feather-like structure rather than cascading cherry blossoms. The extension and general form resemble traditional bird tails more closely than an array of blossoms, contrasting the expectation of complete floral transformation. Image A also presents a typical feathered tail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are shown clearly without any indications of vines wrapped around them. The bird stands on a branch with naked legs, absent of such entanglements. Image A also presents the sparrow on the branch with its legs free from vines.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays several crystal-like ornaments on the bird's chest resembling dewdrops, reflecting light as if sparkling. This complements the ethereal and floral transformation theme. In Image A, the chest of the sparrow lacks any such decorative or glowing elements, highlighting a typical bird's appearance.",
