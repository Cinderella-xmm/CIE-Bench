    "Question": "Q2: Does the fountain feature water that appears crystalline and transparent, with glowing or luminous rocks beneath it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fountain water appears to be clear and forms defined, cascading streams, suggesting transparency typical of crystalline water. However, there is no indication of glowing or luminous rocks beneath it. The area beneath the water does not emit or reflect light that implies illumination or luminescence.
