      "question": "Are the kimono and fox mask rendered with sharp geometric shapes and angular lines characteristic of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono and fox mask do not exhibit sharp geometric shapes or angular lines that are characteristic of Art Deco design. Instead, they feature flowing lines and organic patterns, which align more closely with traditional Japanese aesthetics rather than geometric Art Deco styles. The shapes are smooth and rounded rather than angular.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the outlines and internal details of both the kimono and the fox mask feature prominent bold lines and angular geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines and internal details of both the kimono and fox mask lack bold lines or angular geometry. The design elements on the mask are curvaceous and intricate, resembling traditional patterns. Similarly, the kimono displays floral motifs that are soft and detailed, not bold or angular. These observations indicate a departure from angular geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the floral patterns on the kimono been replaced with simplified, abstract, and stylized motifs rather than realistic flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the floral patterns on the kimono remain complex and detailed without a shift toward abstraction or excessive stylization. They retain realistic elements of flowers, showcasing a traditional approach to floral designs rather than a simplified or highly abstract style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s dominant colors include deep reds and gold metallic tones prominently visible in both the kimono and the fox mask. These rich, metallic hues complement the overall design, reflecting opulence and warmth. Pale pinks are integrated subtly within the kimono pattern. Together, these colors create a visually striking composition.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition symmetrically balanced, with harmonious alignment between the kimono and mask, and do the textures appear refined and unified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a symmetrical and balanced composition. The fox mask and kimono are aligned harmoniously, and the textures are consistently refined and unified across the elements. The symmetry of the mask ears and the centered kimono fold contribute to this balanced aesthetic, reflecting an intentional design cohesion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette and proportions of the person’s body, kimono, and mask maintain a harmonious balance. Despite stylistic embellishments, the overall proportions and silhouette remain coherent and well-integrated, ensuring the visual harmony is not disturbed by the design elements.",
