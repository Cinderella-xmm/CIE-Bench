      "question": "Has the pocket watch been transformed into a cylindrical glass vessel resembling a whiskey bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it still portrays a round, ornate pocket watch with engravings on a wooden background. There are no visual indications of transformation into a cylindrical glass shape or any resemblance to a whiskey bottle. This maintains the original structure of a pocket watch instead of a cylindrical form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ornate engravings from the original watch visible as embossed patterns on the surface of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to show the ornate carvings on the pocket watch, emphasized in a circular layout. These engravings are intricate and ornate typical to antique pocket watches. There is no evidence of transformation into embossed patterns on a bottle surface since a bottle is not present.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central face of the pocket watch in Image B has markings typical for a clock face, such as Roman numerals and clock hands, but there is no 'Timeless Reserve' label visible. The characteristics are consistent with a watch, not resembling a bottle label.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Roman numerals are indeed arranged around the edge of the watch face as part of the clock design, which is typical for pocket watches. However, since there is no 'Timeless Reserve' label shown, this configuration pertains to the watch design rather than a label.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top ring on the pocket watch in Image B remains consistent with the watch's design, showing the traditional winding crown for setting the watch. There is no transformation into a bottle cap or any cork stopper visible, maintaining the authentic watch appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there visible gold accents on the bottle, particularly on the cap, label, or embossed designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays gold accents as part of the ornate engravings on the surface of the pocket watch, particularly around the face and edges, but not on a bottle cap or label since no bottle is portrayed. These gold details are inherent to the decorative aspect of the watch, not an external container.",
