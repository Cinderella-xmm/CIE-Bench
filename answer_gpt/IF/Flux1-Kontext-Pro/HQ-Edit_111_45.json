    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a flat, stylized manner consistent with a medieval illuminated manuscript, including use of gold highlights and non-realistic proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a flat and stylized appearance characteristic of medieval illuminated manuscripts. The figures and elements are rendered with exaggerated outlines and flat coloring techniques. The use of gold highlights is prominent, and the proportions of the figures, such as their hands and hammers, appear non-realistic as typically seen in such manuscripts.",

      "question": "Does the central figure have a clearly visible golden halo surrounding their head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is depicted with a distinct golden halo surrounding their head. This is a traditional element in medieval religious art, signifying holiness or divinity, aligning with the stylized theme of the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central figure wearing long, flowing medieval-style robes with soft drapery instead of a simple apron and tunic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still portrays the central figure wearing an apron and tunic rather than long, flowing robes with soft drapery. The representation remains similar to traditional craftsman attire, which is common in medieval manuscript depictions of working scenes, indicating practicality over decorative clothing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the hammer and tongs been replaced or modified to appear as divine or sacred instruments, such as incorporating religious symbols or glowing elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer and tongs do not exhibit modifications to appear divine or sacred. They maintain their functional appearance without added religious symbols or glowing elements, which would alter their purpose from tool to sacred artifact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forge still contains elements of a realistic fire, with bright flames that do not look ethereal or otherworldly. While the style may slightly embellish the glow, it maintains a fundamentally realistic depiction of a furnace fire.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of Image B feature decorative entwining vine borders. This is a common characteristic of medieval illuminated manuscripts, where florid and intricate borders frame the central image, enhancing the ornate and stylized presentation.",
