      "question": "Are the architectural elements in the background rendered with detailed Mughal-style arches, domes, and minarets using gold and vermilion hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases architectural elements featuring Mughal-style arches and dome structures.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the people in the background are dressed in vibrant, colorful attire, but the depiction leans towards a simplified representation rather than delicate, jewel-like pattern work. While their clothing colors are lively, their depiction lacks the intricacy and fine brushwork associated with courtly figures in classic Mughal miniatures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a central composition with the rider positioned on the elephant, visually establishing a focal point. The rendering captures the flat, stylized manner typical in Mughal miniatures, with a focus on decorative rather than realistic texture details and spatial depth. This choice of stylization marks a distinct characteristic of Mughal art traditions.",
