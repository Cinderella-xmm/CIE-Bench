      "question": "Is the central figure wearing a gown made of velvet with visible intricate lacework and pearls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is wearing a gown that appears to be made of a rich, heavy fabric which is consistent with velvet. The gown also features visible intricate gold embroidery, which could be interpreted as lacework. The presence of pearls or similar embellishments might be inferred from the lavish design and style. Given these visual cues and the traditional use of velvet in opulent clothing, it is reasonable to conclude that the gown is velvet with some kind of detailed decoration.",
