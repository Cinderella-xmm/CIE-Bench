      "question": "Is the cliffside visibly shaped like a mythical titan creature with distinct anatomical features such as a head, body, or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clearly a large mythical creature resembling a titan standing on the cliffside. The creature has distinct anatomical features like a head, body, limbs, and even armor. Its presence is obvious and not intangible, blending elements of mythology and fantasy in its design. The cliff itself is used as part of the background rather than forming the creature. Without comparing Image A at this point, based simply on the visible cues in Image B, it's clear that the creature itself is not shaped from the cliffside; rather, it is separate from it.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the jagged rock formations now resemble segmented armor plating, with moss growing along their edges or crevices as decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the titan is wearing detailed, segmented armor that appears separate from the rocky background. However, the rock formations of the cliff are not visibly altered to resemble armor platings themselves. There isn't moss growing on the creature's armor, but the cliff and landscape retain their natural look. Observing the titan itself, the creature has moss as part of its design, complementing the armor as decorative elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water below the cliff appear as translucent, flowing spectral limbs connected to the titan’s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing the water depicted below the cliffs in Image B, it does not appear as limbs or spectral elements connected to the titan. The water retains its natural appearance as part of the ocean, reflecting sunlight. The visible spectral elements are situated around the titan itself, spiraling around its form, but do not connect with the water seen below.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the small trees arranged in a dense, flowing pattern along the upper part of the titan’s head or neck, resembling a textured mane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the titan has a mane made of hair that visually resembles a dense collection of flowing patterns. Although there is greenery on the cliffs, such as trees or bushes, they are not arranged on the titan's head or neck itself. The mane on the titan is part of its own body, styled to appear fierce and textured, quite distinct from any arrangement of vegetation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible carved runes or symbolic markings on the surface of the rock formations forming the titan?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The titan in Image B is equipped with ornamented armor that carries intricate engravings and designs. However, these are part of the armor and not on any rock formations. The cliffs and natural formations surrounding sustain their integrity without embedded markings or runes. Therefore, the visible engravings are limited to its personal armor, defining its detailed appearance.",

      "question": "Are the clouds replaced by glowing, twisting spirit-like forms spiraling around the titan’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed glowing, twisting forms that resemble spiritual or ethereal movements, they appear as swirling energy around the titan's body. These forms are not replacing clouds but are incorporated alongside the titan to enhance its mythical presence.",
