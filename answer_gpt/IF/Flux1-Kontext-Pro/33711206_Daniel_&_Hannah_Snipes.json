      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting maintains the same arrangement of flowers and foliage as seen in Image A without any additional elements added. The scene is lively due to the existing garden arrangement but no new floral or foliage elements appear to enhance it further.",
