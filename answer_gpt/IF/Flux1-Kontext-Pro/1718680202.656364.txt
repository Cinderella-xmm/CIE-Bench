    "Question": "Q2: Does the image combine photorealistic rendering of the capybara and environment with illustrated or stylized elements (e.g., exaggerated features, cartoon-like details)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara and environment are illustrated in a stylized manner with vibrant colors and illustrative features, such as cartoon-like eyes and a bright, playful presentation.

    "explanation": "In Image A, the colors appear more subdued and realistic, typical of a photograph during sunset with softer, warmer hues. In Image B, the blues in the capybara's beanie and the color of the beverage are more vivid and saturated. This is evidenced by the bright, cartoon-like presentation in Image B which opts for a more eye-catching and vibrant palette. Such saturation is commonly seen in illustrations to attract attention and is visible through the more intense shade of blue.",
