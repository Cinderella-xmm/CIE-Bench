    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck appears to have a smooth surface with detailing that resembles a real vehicle rather than the iconic studded appearance of LEGO bricks. LEGO models typically have visible small interlocking pieces, and the truck in Image B lacks such characteristics, indicating it is likely not constructed from LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
    "explanation": "The wheels in Image B appear to resemble realistic tires, with intricate rim designs, and not the typical simplistic design seen in LEGO wheels. There are no visible signs of construction from brick-like elements, supporting that they are not built from LEGO pieces.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface?",
    "explanation": "The truck bed in Image B looks like it has a realistic textured surface rather than a surface covered with smooth LEGO tiles. LEGO tiles would impart a flat, uniform look, which is not observed here, implying the bed retains a realistic truck finish.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it above the ground?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the truck positioned on a completely white surface with a visible edge that suggests it is a shelf or table, unlike Image A, where the truck is on a ground with gravel. The white surface in Image B confirms that the truck is elevated above the ground.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the LEGO model retain the correct shape and proportions of the original pickup truck, including the cab, bed, and wheelbase?",
    "explanation": "Although Image B is a model of a real truck, it appears proportionally accurate to real-life versions seen in Image A; the cab, bed, and wheelbase all mimic the design of a conventional pickup truck. This suggests the model retains the shape and proportions in a realistic manner, without LEGO-like variations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
