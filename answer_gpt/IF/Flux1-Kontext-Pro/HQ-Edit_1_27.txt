    "Question": "Q1: Is the scene enclosed within a visible decorative glass dome that surrounds the entire diorama?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly encapsulated within a decorative glass dome, which is typical for a diorama or snow globe design. This enclosure is apparent from the curved glass structure visible in the image and the wooden base supporting the glass. The presence of this dome indicates a bounded and carefully crafted scene. The enclosure creates a barrier between the scene inside and the external environment, enhancing its decorative aspect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the snow in the scene have a delicate, powdery texture, appearing soft and lightly settled rather than dense or icy?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow appears to have a soft and powdery texture, consistent with what is observed in dioramas or snow globes. The visual cues indicate that the snow is evenly spread across the scene, enhancing the delicate and intricate look of the miniature display, without showing signs of being dense or icy such as hard-packed surfaces or glittering ice patches.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are all human figures in the scene noticeably smaller in scale and dressed in vintage-style clothing consistent with early 20th-century Parisian fashion?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases human figures that are small in scale consistent with a miniature display format. However, upon careful inspection, there isn't a definitive indication that they are dressed in vintage-style clothing; rather, their clothing appears to be generic winter attire lacking distinct early 20th-century fashion characteristics like coats typical of that era's specific style. The human figures are indicative of modern or timeless winter wear.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the streetlamps in the scene significantly smaller than normal scale and do they emit a soft, subtle glow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlamps are indeed smaller than normal scale, fitting within the miniaturized setting like a diorama under a dome. However, there is no glow visible emanating from them. The scene is brightly lit, perhaps indicating daylight rather than night, so the streetlamps do not show any signature glowing feature. The lamps contribute to the aesthetic without actually lighting the scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there small, leafless trees in the scene with only a light dusting of snow on their branches?",
    "explanation": "The trees in Image B are depicted as small and leafless, aligned with the imagery often seen in winter scenes. They reflect the consistency of being a part of a miniature depiction. However, the branches appear to have more substantial snow coverage rather than just a light dusting, suggesting heavier snowfall or thicker accumulation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible cobblestone pathways, partially exposed and winding through the snow-covered ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow covers the ground thoroughly and uniformly. There is no indication of cobblestone pathways or exposed sections that would cut through the snow in a winding pattern. It appears designed as a smooth snow-covered surface maintaining continuity and simplicity within the display.",
    "answer": "No"
