    "Question": "Q4: Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the road and coastal cliffs with an appearance that suggests a crafted, layered resin construction.

    "Question": "Q5: Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the road and cliffs are detailed to include micro gravel textures, adding a tactile dimension typical of detailed model landscapes or dioramas.

    "Question": "Q6: Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",
    "explanation": "While Image B shows the diorama with a sunset sky background, this element is part of the scene itself rather than a separate panel at the top of the display case. The sky serves as the scenic backdrop, not an individual component of the case structure. There's no panel defining the upper boundary within the visible design.",
    "answer": "No"
