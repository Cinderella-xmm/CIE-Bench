      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cathedral and surrounding square depicted at a significantly reduced scale, consistent with a miniature model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral and the surrounding square appear significantly smaller than in real life, resembling a model rather than an actual large architectural structure. This conclusion is drawn from the proportion of the cathedral to the miniature human figures and the enclosure within a display case, typically used for showcasing small-scale models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within an ornate, decorative frame featuring baroque-style architectural details such as scrolls, columns, or intricate carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame enclosing the scene is visible but appears to be a simple display case frame without intricate decorative elements like scrolls, columns, or carvings typical of baroque-style architecture. Thus, the frame does not exhibit these features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale human figures present in the square, wearing detailed historical or formal attire, and positioned as if walking or strolling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts small-scale human figures in the square, similar to those used in models or miniatures. They are positioned in a dynamic fashion, which suggests movement like walking or strolling, fitting the description of a scaled model environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cathedral façade uniformly colored in a warm beige tone and visually textured to resemble resin rather than natural stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral façade appears consistently colored in a warm beige shade that could visually mimic resin, which is often used in model making for a uniform appearance. This contrasts natural stone, which typically displays more variance in texture and color.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, vintage-style lamps placed around the scene emitting a soft, dim, warm glow consistent with antique lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible small vintage-style lamps around the scene providing an antique lighting effect. The illumination seems to come from an overhead light source typical of display cases rather than specific lamp features within the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows an engraved plaque at the bottom of the display case, with visible text. Although not entirely legible in the image, it suggests identification information relevant to the cathedral, commonly placed in model displays for informational purposes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background of the scene a painted depiction of a vibrant sky, with visible color gradients and cloud formations, framed by a soft vignette effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop of the display case features a bright, painted sky with visible cloud formations but without a soft vignette effect. This indicates a deliberate artistic choice for the background, typical of model displays to simulate an open atmosphere.",
