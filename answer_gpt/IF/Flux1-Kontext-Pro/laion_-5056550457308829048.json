      "question": "Is the image formatted as a cereal box design with visible box-like structure or paneling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design features SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star in a colorful, cartoon-like setting with basketballs, but there is no visual evidence of a cereal box structure or paneling. It lacks box-like edges, branding, nutritional information, or other typical cereal box elements. Therefore, it appears to be more of a creative, thematic composition rather than a cereal box design.",

      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an urban sports scene featuring graffiti-style elements such as spray paint art, street markings, or urban structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background consists of a bright and cheerful, cartoonish scene with clouds and grass, consistent with the idyllic and playful setting of SpongeBob SquarePants. There are no visual representations of urban sports scenes, graffiti, spray paint art, or urban structures. The elements are more whimsical and colorful rather than gritty or urban.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no text displayed across the top of the image. The focus is on the characters and background elements with no additional overlay of text or messages like “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!”. Thus, the edited image does not contain such text.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Patrick is wearing a shirt with a large number '3' on it, but there are no basketball-themed motifs such as basketballs, hoops, or court designs visible. Rather, it looks like a simple sports-themed shirt with the number indicating a player jersey style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, SpongeBob is wearing plain sneakers with black coloration. There is no indication of cereal loop patterns or any thematic elements that suggest these sneakers are styled after cereal loops.",
