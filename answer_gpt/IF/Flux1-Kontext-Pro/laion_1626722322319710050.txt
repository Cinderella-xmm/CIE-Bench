    "Question": "Q1: Is the statue and its base fully enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue and its base are clearly visible within a transparent glass dome. The dome encompasses the entire statue, providing a complete enclosure, which is evident from the reflection and the curvature of the glass. This suggests that the statue and base are indeed enclosed. There is no visible break in the glass dome as the transparent material forms a coherent enclosure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Has the statue been transformed into a sleek, metallic 3D figure with a reflective surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue exhibits a metallic finish that significantly contrasts with the stone appearance in Image A. This metallic texture reflects light and has a sleek surface, which is common in metal statues due to the reflective nature of the metal material. The transformation to a metallic figure is evident from the way light interacts with its surface, giving it a polished and reflective appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there small-scale trees with translucent or semi-transparent leaves surrounding the metallic figure inside the dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two small trees are seen adjacent to the statue within the dome. The leaves of these trees appear delicate and somewhat translucent, which is typical in artistic representations. They possess a thinness and lightness that is visually suggested by the shadows and light penetration through the glass dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
