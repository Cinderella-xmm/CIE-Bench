      "question": "Have the visible cracks and broken areas on the clock tower been restored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the visible cracks and broken areas are noticeably present. There are large holes and missing segments on the tower, which indicate that no restoration has taken place to address these damages. These signs of wear and tear and broken architecture demonstrate that the cracks and broken areas remain visible and have not been repaired.",

      "question": "Are there any gaps or missing parts left unfilled on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, large gaps and missing parts are evident, particularly below the clock face and in other parts of the tower. The structural integrity is compromised, with visible hollow spaces in the structure. This analysis indicates that there are numerous gaps present, confirming that these areas remain unfilled and unrepaired.",

      "question": "Do the restored parts match the original texture and color of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there appears to be no indication of restoration work applied to the clock tower. The surface of the structure retains its original weathered appearance, with visible cracks and a consistent texture and color throughout. Any restoration that might have been done would have aimed to restore the structure to its undamaged appearance and color; however, Image B indicates that no such effort has been made, or the work wasn't completed. Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no restoration and matching of textures or colors.",

      "question": "Does the restored clock tower maintain the original architectural style and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the clock tower maintaining its architectural style, with no visible signs of restoration work. The existing structure includes features like arches, stonework, and tower shape consistent with historical architectural styles. However, given the lack of restoration evidenced by the continued presence of gaps and cracks, no additional restoration details would be present. Therefore, the tower remains in its original form, without restoration altering architectural details.",

      "question": "Is the clock face intact and legible after the restoration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face appears intact and legible, displaying Roman numerals and consistent design for a classic clock face, despite the deteriorated surrounding structure. The hands of the clock are present and clearly visible, allowing the time to be read without obstruction. This indicates that the clock face itself is intact and functional, regardless of the unaddressed surrounding damage.",
