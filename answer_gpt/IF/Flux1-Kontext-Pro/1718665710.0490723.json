      "question": "Is the character depicted as a small, stylized chibi figure suitable for a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is showcased as a compact figure with exaggerated, child-like proportions characteristic of the chibi art style. These include a larger head, small stature, and shorter limbs. Such features are typically used in designs that are made into keychains, enhancing their cuteness and appeal in smaller, collectible formats.",

      "question": "Does the armor feature glossy enamel-like colors with visible reflections and thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor in Image B is detailed and textured, with a metallic appearance, but it doesn't specifically display enamel-like colors or thick black outlines that would indicate a specific stylistic choice like cel-shading or enamel design. Instead, the style appears more realistic in line with typical metal armor design.",

      "question": "Is the character's head significantly larger than the body, while still showing detailed curly hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's head is indeed proportionally larger than the body, a common trait of chibi figures. Despite the size, the head displays detailed, curly hair, which adds a sense of realism to the stylized form, maintaining the chibi aesthetic while incorporating intricate details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A small silver chain is attached to the top of the character's head in Image B. This visual cue is a strong indication that the item is designed to function as a keychain, allowing it to be attached to other items like key rings, bags, or zippers.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed a plain, dark color, giving an impression similar to a dark, velvet-textured surface. There are no visible architectural elements present, which further highlights the character, creating a contrast with the background.",
