    "Question": "Q1: Is there a top view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a side view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the top right and bottom right sub-images show the glove at an angle with the baseball inside, but these are not truly side views, as they are slightly inclined and still showing the interior of the glove. They do not exemplify a true side profile where only the side of the glove and baseball would be visible.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a sectional view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
