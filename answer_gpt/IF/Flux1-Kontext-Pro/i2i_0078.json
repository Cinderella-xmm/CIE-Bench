      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a steampunk-style train station waiting room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows an interior space with a repetitive pattern of windows and a platform design. The architecture is reminiscent of train station waiting areas but lacks distinctive steampunk features like exaggerated gears, brass elements, or anachronistic technology that define a steampunk aesthetic. The design leans more towards a vintage or classical waiting room rather than one explicitly tied to the steampunk genre.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original lighting and shadows on the wristwatch preserved after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch displays consistent lighting and shadowing relative to a similar position in Image A. The reflections on the metal bracelet and the highlights on the watch face suggest that the lighting environment has been preserved to match the original indoor setting. The continuity offers the impression that the change in the backdrop hasn't altered the primary lighting on the watch itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the new background contain steampunk elements such as gears, metallic textures, or vintage train station features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background consistent with traditional train station architecture, characterized by windows and a platform, without evident steampunk elements like gears, brass textures, or retro-futuristic decorations. Thus, while evoking a historical period, it does not embrace the steampunk fantasy and retro-futuristic aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wristwatch still prominently displayed and undistorted in the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch is clearly and prominently situated in the foreground, much like in Image A. The shape and proportions remain intact, showing no signs of distortion from editing. The watch remains the focal point, demonstrating consistent clarity and detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible elements such as steam trains, clockwork devices, or industrial platforms in the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a setting reminiscent of a train station, with a repeated window pattern and a long corridor, yet lacks explicit features like visible steam trains, clockwork devices, or overtly industrial platforms. These elements are typically more indicative of a steampunk or industrial scene, which is not evident here.",
