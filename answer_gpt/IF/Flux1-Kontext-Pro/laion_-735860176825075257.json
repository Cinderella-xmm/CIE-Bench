    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the building architecture with defined lines and edges, giving it a stylized and sharp appearance. This suggests an artistic rendition leaning towards a paper-cut art style, where sharp and angular edges are often used to create crisp, clear visuals. However, the style is not overly exaggerated to mimic paper-cut art strictly, but it does maintain a distinct, clean look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the window frames and plant motifs enhanced with visible gold foil-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window frames and plant motifs appear normal without any visible gold accents. The colors are consistent with natural representations rather than having any shiny or metallic accents that would be characteristic of gold foil. Gold foil-like accents would stand out sharply against the rest of the imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the entrance awning colored in a bold crimson hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entrance awning in Image B is depicted in a deep red, almost crimson shade which catches the eye, especially against the neutral tones of the building. This bold choice in color enhances visibility and adds a striking visual contrast to the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background of each postcard rendered with a textured cream-colored paper appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the backgrounds of the depicted postcards with a cream-colored appearance, which has a subtly textured look, reminiscent of high-quality paper. This choice gives the postcards an elegant and classic feel, typical of vintage or artistic postcard designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each postcard feature a geometric arch border around its edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each portion of Image B shows a distinct arch shape outlining the building images, creating a rounded-top geometric appearance. This style choice highlights each building's image separately, emphasizing the classic postcard design motif of featured, framed vignettes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the postcards presented without any visible frame or border, maintaining a clean, borderless edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the postcards in Image B having a clean and precise presentation, they are bordered by the distinct arch shapes that serve as a frame for each building depiction. The presence of these shaped borders contradicts the notion of a completely borderless edge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there exactly three separate postcards displayed, each showing a variation of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of three distinct arch-shaped segments, each depicting a different angled view or variation of the building fa√ßade. The segmentation and individual arch designs clearly indicate the presence of three separate postcard representations.",
