    "Question": "Q2: Is the suit rendered with visible watercolor effects, showing blended blue-black hues and soft, painterly edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the suit appears less sharp and exhibits a texture that mimics the look of watercolor paint. The hues of blue-black are blended together with softer edges, creating a painterly effect rather than a precise photographic one. Such effects simulate the characteristics of watercolor paintings where distinct, sharp lines are often absent, and colors merge softly with hints of granulation.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are there visible golden pinstripes running vertically along the suit jacket, consistent with the watercolor aesthetic?",

The lack of pinstripes maintains the aesthetic continuity with the rest of the painterly appearance, emphasizing blended hues rather than distinct, thin lines that pinstripes would imply.",
