      "question": "Is the mirror still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large rectangular object above the sink does not have the reflective property typically associated with mirrors. Instead, this space is occupied by a piece of wall art. Mirrors usually have sharp, reflective surfaces, allowing for clear reflections of surroundings, but there is no reflection seen. Therefore, the mirror is absent in this image.",

      "question": "Has the area previously occupied by the mirror been replaced with a minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a landscape scene where one would typically expect a mirror, featuring a green field, trees, and distant mountains. Landscape scenes are a common motif for wall art, suggesting that the space once occupied by the mirror is now filled by a piece of nature-themed decor, aligned with minimalist trends.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the minimalist landscape wall art appear to have a fabric canvas material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the landscape wall art in Image B appears to have a textured appearance often associated with a fabric canvas, which provides a slightly uneven surface, distinct from the smoothness expected of print or paper materials. This textured look is typical for artworks painted or printed on canvas material.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, all other bathroom elements such as the sink, vase, lights, and tiles appear to be unchanged when compared to known common designs and features. These elements maintain the same design and placement as expected, indicating no unintentional changes have been made.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Aside from the replacement of the mirror with a piece of minimalist landscape wall art, no other alterations or additional elements are evident in the bathroom setting of Image B. All other components, such as furnishings and decor, are consistent with their typical forms.",
