    "Question": "Q1: Is the building's facade composed of visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a building with a characteristic LEGO aesthetic, featuring simplified and uniform blocky structures. The bricks appear to be regularly shaped and consistently sized, similar to LEGO pieces. This depiction aligns with the recognizable blocky formation of LEGO sets.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the buildingâ€™s bricks rendered in muted red tones and the window frames in muted blue tones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the building appears to be created using specialized LEGO bricks, which typically prioritize a simplified color scheme. The bricks display a muted red color, while the windows have a consistent look with blue or bluish-gray window frames, characteristic of LEGO design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the climbing plants been replaced with green, segmented LEGO-style vines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the climbing plants observed in Image A have been substituted with segmented, narrow green structures that resemble LEGO-style vines. These simplified forms maintain the blocky aesthetic seen in other LEGO set representations, where organic structures are conveyed through blocky approximations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do all balconies feature gray, blocky LEGO-style railings instead of realistic metal or decorative designs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, balconies are depicted with simplified and uniform gray railings that match the aesthetic typical of LEGO sets. Unlike the realistic and varied designs seen in Image A, these railings are consistent and blocky, corresponding with the overall LEGO stylization.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform that contrasts with the surrounding environment to highlight its blocky aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "Image B places the building on a flat, very regular platform, common in LEGO configurations, which distinctly contrasts with a dynamic real-world setting to preserve the blocky LEGO paradigm. This base is devoid of complex textures, focusing on simplicity as per LEGO design principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
