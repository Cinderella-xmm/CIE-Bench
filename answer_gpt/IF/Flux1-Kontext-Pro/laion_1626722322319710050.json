      "question": "Is the statue and its base fully enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue and its base are clearly visible within a transparent glass dome. The dome encompasses the entire statue, providing a complete enclosure, which is evident from the reflection and the curvature of the glass. This suggests that the statue and base are indeed enclosed. There is no visible break in the glass dome as the transparent material forms a coherent enclosure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the statue been transformed into a sleek, metallic 3D figure with a reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue exhibits a metallic finish that significantly contrasts with the stone appearance in Image A. This metallic texture reflects light and has a sleek surface, which is common in metal statues due to the reflective nature of the metal material. The transformation to a metallic figure is evident from the way light interacts with its surface, giving it a polished and reflective appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale trees with translucent or semi-transparent leaves surrounding the metallic figure inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two small trees are seen adjacent to the statue within the dome. The leaves of these trees appear delicate and somewhat translucent, which is typical in artistic representations. They possess a thinness and lightness that is visually suggested by the shadows and light penetration through the glass dome.",

    {

      "question": "Are there additional small engraved plaques with historical text visible on the base of the miniature scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an engraved plaque visible on the base of the miniature scene. While it differs from Image A's plaque, it serves a similar function, providing text or information that could potentially be historical. This detail, along with other decorations on the base, aligns with common practices for providing context or information about the depicted figure.",

      "question": "Does the stand beneath the glass dome feature a polished stone surface with delicate vine patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stand with what appears to be a polished surface, characterized by a smooth and glossy finish. Furthermore, there are intricate vine patterns that give the stand a decorative and ornate appearance. These patterns typically suggest artistic embellishment, common in sophisticated design.",
