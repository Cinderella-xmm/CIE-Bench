      "question": "Does the right-side skier cast a shadow that suggests depth and closeness to the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow of the right-side skier is visible on the snow surface, which is dark and well-defined, indicating a proximity to the snow that enhances the perception of depth and closeness to the viewer. The shadow's direction and intensity contribute to the dimensionality and realism, as shadows typically appear more distinct and darker when an object is closer to the surface.",

      "question": "Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the right-side skier is surrounded by a spray of snow, capturing a dynamic action as the skier moves downhill. This suggests motion; however, there are no traditional motion lines or blurring effects visible around the skier's edges typical in drawing or editing to simulate high-speed movement. The clarity of skier's figure and equipment remains distinct and sharp.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier is positioned in the foreground, and their size, combined with the shadow and angle, emphasizes closeness to the viewer. While the skier is indeed closer than the background mountains, this foreground placement is common in photography of such sports to convey action and depth, but they are appropriately scaled relative to the rest in the scene, not an exaggerated re-positioning.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier is shown with a slight forward lean, typical for skiing downhill fast, and this posture suggests momentum toward the viewer in a dynamic fashion. The skier's body inclination gives a sense of engaging in movement toward the lower foreground, enhancing the perception of movement and depth in the composition.",
