      "question": "Are expressive faces and limbs added to the cookies to make them anthropomorphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies have been given expressive faces and limbs, which is evident from their design. Anthropomorphic elements like eyes, mouths, and limbs are added to the cookies, making them appear as if they have human-like characteristics. This conclusion is based on the recognition of facial features and appendages on the cookies, combined with the world knowledge that these elements are used to attribute human-like qualities to objects.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include at least one cookie with a grinning expression, one with a pouting expression, and one with a winking expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies display varied facial expressions. One cookie has a grinning expression, which can be identified by its wide-open eyes and curved smile. Another has a pouting expression, which typically features a downturned mouth indicating displeasure or reflection. However, there is no visible cookie with a winking expression, as a wink would generally show one closed or partly closed eye alongside the opposite eye being open. This analysis combines visual recognition and common understanding of facial expressions.",

      "question": "Is there a tea party scene depicted, including props such as a tiny tea table or teacups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a teacup visible, additional elements commonly associated with a tea party, such as a tea table or multiple teacups, are absent. The setup includes a teacup, but in context, it is used to hold cookies rather than part of a scene portraying a tea party. This deduction uses the absence of typical tea party elements and props to conclude that the image does not depict a full tea party scene.",

      "question": "Has the cup been modified to resemble a clubhouse, such as having windows, doors, or other architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cup retains its original form without any modifications that would give it features resembling a clubhouse. There are no added architectural details like windows or doors that would transform its appearance. The analysis relies on observing the cup's surface and identifying the absence of any such details that would suggest architectural modification.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pink plate from Image A remains unchanged and has not been replaced with anything resembling a picnic blanket. The plate is still visible in the scene, and there is no sign of any floral pattern associated with picnic blankets behind or around the cup. The analysis here compares the surface beneath the cup to determine that the original plate persists.",
