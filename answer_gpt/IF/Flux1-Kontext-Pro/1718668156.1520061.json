      "question": "Is the tall ice tower in the foreground rendered with pixelated textures and visible circuit-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall ice tower has a glowing blue outline with circuit-like patterns visible throughout its surface, which deviates from the realistic ice appearance seen in typical photography. This suggests a digital or pixelated aesthetic. The use of these glowing patterns indicates an intent to create a futuristic or digital theme. Therefore, the tower clearly features pixelated textures and circuit-like patterns.",

      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House represented using glowing neon lines instead of solid surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House is outlined using neon blue lines that light up its shape, which is different from the typical solid surfaces of the actual structure. This representation uses glowing lines to emphasize a digital rendering, which is common in neon art or digital graphics. Hence, the Opera House is indeed depicted with glowing neon lines.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves in the ocean composed of geometric shapes rather than realistic water ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water in Image B is depicted with a pattern of lines and shapes, creating a grid or geometric appearance rather than natural and irregular water ripples. This suggests a transformation into a digital or artificially structured representation, implying that the waves consist of geometric shapes.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the drink on the left appear as a transparent, floating hologram with visible depth and light distortion effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drink on the left is depicted with a glowing red-orange appearance, and the liquid inside seems to have glowing particles and light distortion that gives the impression of depth. This rendering captures the essence of a hologram, as it appears luminous and semi-transparent, typical of holographic projections. Thus, the drink looks like a transparent, floating hologram.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a unified futuristic digital aesthetic, with all elements (ice tower, Opera House, ocean, drink) transformed according to their specified styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a consistent transformation across all elements: the ice tower is rendered with digital patterns, the Opera House is outlined with neon lines, the ocean is composed of geometric patterns, and the drink is portrayed as a hologram. All these elements together create a cohesive futuristic digital theme. The use of glowing lines and digital patterns throughout the image solidifies a unified aesthetic.",
