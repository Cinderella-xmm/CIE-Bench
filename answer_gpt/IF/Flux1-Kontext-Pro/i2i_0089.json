      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit a 3D style with depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is positioned on a textured blue blanket, and the details in its fur, as well as the folds in the cloth, provide a sense of depth and realism. The lighting accentuates the contours of the kitten's face, which enhances the perception of depth, making the image appear three-dimensional to an extent. This depth is achieved through the use of lighting and shading rather than any exaggerated 3D elements. Combining this visual cue with common photography techniques that create a sense of depth, there is evidence of a 3D style.",

      "question": "Does the edited image depict the kitten as actively jumping out of the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is shown lying on the blanket with a calm demeanor, as indicated by its relaxed posture and facial expression. There are no visual cues, such as exaggerated motion lines or positioning, that would suggest an action like jumping. Visually, the kitten appears stationary and content, not displaying any dynamics associated with jumping. Thus, knowledge of animal behavior further supports the conclusion that the kitten is not depicted as any active motion like jumping.",

      "question": "Is the 3D effect in the image achieved without requiring special glasses or external devices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B relies on natural photography techniques such as depth of field, lighting, and shading, which inherently create a three-dimensional appearance without the need for any specialized equipment like 3D glasses. The 3D effect is subtle and achieved through these visual techniques that are visible to the naked eye.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the kitten's original appearance, including color and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image A and Image B, we can see that both images maintain the same color palette and texture for the kitten. The orange and white colors of the kitten's fur, its texture, and facial features are consistent between the two images, indicating that the kitten's original appearance is preserved. The editing focused on emphasizing depth rather than altering the kitten's intrinsic characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's features still clearly visible and not obscured by the 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B presents the kitten with clear visibility of its features such as eyes, nose, and whiskers. There are no disruptive elements or exaggerated 3D effects that obscure these features. The clarity of these features is maintained, suggesting that while a three-dimensional effect is present, it does not negatively impact the visibility or clarity of the kitten's image.",
