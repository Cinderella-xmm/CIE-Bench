      "question": "Has the cactus been transformed into a surreal, non-naturalistic creature with a distinct sentient appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a traditional cactus, there's a fantastical creature with elements like segmented legs and a crystal-like spine, suggesting a sentient design. The image presents these features in a manner that is far removed from natural cactus characteristics, indicating a deliberate transformation into a surreal being.",

      "question": "Do the cactus arms now appear as segmented, flexible appendages terminating in glowing orbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B shows a surface covered with scales, creating an iridescent effect reflecting desert colors. This differs from Image Aâ€™s natural cactus surface with typical plant textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a tall, crystal-like structure as the central spine of the creature, whereas in Image A, a traditional cactus column is present. This indicates a replacement of the column with a more fantastical, faceted element.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has tendrils which mimic the general shape and contour of the new creature, unlike the thorny texture of a cactus in Image A. However, these tendrils do not appear to glow and are segmented appendages instead.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the surreal creature firmly anchored in sandy terrain, casting a realistic shadow, and positioned upright like a vigilant sentinel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is situated in sandy terrain and casts a shadow, suggesting solidity and a column-like structure that positions it upright, similar to a sentinel in a desert environment. The stance and shadow reinforce its presence in the terrain.",
