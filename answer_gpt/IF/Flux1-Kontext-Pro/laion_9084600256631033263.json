      "question": "Has the body of the car been transformed into a sleek, silver glass bottle that reflects the original car's curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a car that largely maintains the characteristics of a classic convertible sports car. The body is silver, and while there are smooth curves typical of vintage design, the body has not been transformed into a glass bottle. It is made of standard car material, not glass, and retains the traditional form of a car's exterior without transformation into a bottle shape. Thus, while the styling reflects the original car's curves, it has not been changed into glass.",

      "question": "Have the original headlights been replaced with faceted glass stoppers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headlights are round and maintain the traditional characteristics of car headlights with a reflective surface and a bulb inside. They are not replaced with faceted glass stoppers which would typically have a jewel-like appearance with multiple surfaces reflecting light at various angles. Therefore, the headlights maintain their original form rather than being transformed into glass stoppers.",

      "question": "Is there a chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid on top of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it shows a round chrome object resembling a large, decorative ornament on the windshield frame, possibly suggesting a high-end or fantastical design. However, this ornament is not gear-shaped but more like a stylized spherical object. Therefore, there is no gear-shaped lid on the car.",

      "question": "Is the Datsun 1600 emblem embossed on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, we can see that the front emblem of the car is a Mercedes-Benz logo, not a Datsun emblem. The edited car does not carry any visible 'Datsun 1600' branding. Thus, there is no Datsun 1600 emblem embossed on the front.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the decanter design combine vintage styling (such as classic curves or script) with modern branding elements (such as clean lines or minimalist text)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a car with retro elements like chrome bumper details and classic curves reminiscent of vintage styling. The emblem on the front is the modern Mercedes-Benz logo, which is characterized by its clean, minimalist design. The combination of these elements suggests a fusion of vintage design aesthetics with modern branding, reflecting a classic yet current style.",
