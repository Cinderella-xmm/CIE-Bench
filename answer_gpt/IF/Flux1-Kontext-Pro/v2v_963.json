      "question": "Is the collectible figure a 3D-rendered design inspired by the subjects in the photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a collection of three small collectible figures inside a box. These figures are detailed and stylized with features such as big heads and small bodies, which fits the chibi style often seen in such designs. The presence of the box and figures together suggests inspiration from a real-life scenario like a camping scene. This aligns with the idea of a 3D-rendered design inspired by the subjects of the photograph.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display box in Image B appears to be made of wood and has a natural finish, characterized by visible wood grain and a rustic latch. It resembles a miniature version of a chest or box one might take on a camping trip, designed to contain small items or mementos.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B are depicted with oversized heads compared to their bodies, which is characteristic of the chibi style. However, the features such as eyes and smiles are not detailed in the description provided, so without that feature analysis, we cannot confirm bright smiles or glittering eyes explicitly from the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene inside the box shows a warm depiction of figures around a campfire, creating a sense of a serene camping vibe. However, since this is inside a box and not a full backdrop of a forest, it does not explicitly show a forest night scene, but rather an implied one with soft lighting.",
