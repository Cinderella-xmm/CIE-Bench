      "question": "Is the historic fortress enclosed within a transparent dome structure resembling a terrarium?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is clearly visible within a transparent dome structure. This resembles a terrarium due to its encapsulated environment showcasing the structure inside an enclosed, clear dome. The visual cues, like the glass-like surface and the containment of the fortress and surrounding elements, support this analysis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the grassy terrain been replaced with a dense, textured layer of lush moss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terrain inside the dome appears to be covered with a textured, dense layer that resembles moss. Compared to Image A, where the terrain is visibly grass, the dome's interior in Image B provides visual cues of a more lush and vibrant ground coverage characteristic of moss.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale model knights positioned on or around the terrain within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the dome, there are distinct figures that appear to be small-scale representations of knights positioned around the terrain near the fortress. These figures do not exist in Image A, where the scale is normal-sized without such miniature models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible faux stone pathways integrated into the moss-covered terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a pathway visible on the moss-like terrain inside the dome, which appears constructed from stones or a stone-like material. This feature does not appear in Image A, which presents plain grass terrain. The visual arrangement of the path suggests a man-made integration similar to a landscaping element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the top of the fortress feature a delicate glass star instead of the original weather vane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the dome features a decorative glass star, which is different from the weather vane seen on top of the fortress in Image A. The star is positioned atop the dome and not directly on the fortress, altering the original functional weather vane with an ornamental element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the terrarium supported by an ornate wooden stand exhibiting a vintage patina?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dome sitting on an elaborate wooden base, which has ornate carvings and gives an appearance of vintage craftsmanship. This element supports the whole terrarium-like structure. Image A does not have this feature as it shows the fortress in a real-world setting without such a support base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the historical fortress, botanical elements, and miniature figures coexist in a unified, fantastical diorama style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the combination of the historical fortress, modeled terrain with lush moss, faux stone pathways, and small-scale knight figures all packaged within a glass dome creates a diorama-style display. This differs from Image A, which presents a natural and realistic setting. Image B's components collectively evoke a miniature and fantastical representation.",
