      "question": "Is the pelican rendered in a cartoon-style with simplified and exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican is depicted in a simplified and exaggerated cartoon style characterized by bold outlines and exaggerated shapes, such as large eyes and a prominent beak.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak in Image B is more pronounced with its larger size compared to typical anatomical proportions and emphasizes feature accentuation common in cartoons.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
