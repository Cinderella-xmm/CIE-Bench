    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall visual style of the image transformed into a whimsical, storybook-like illustration rather than a realistic photograph?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is clearly illustrative, with cartoonish elements such as animated forest creatures, vibrant foliage, and a gently swirling path.

    "Question": "Q2: Are bright eyes and a warm smile visibly present on the yellow surface of the front tart, giving it a cheerful, anthropomorphic appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front tart features the 'PABLO' logo on the top of its surface. While there are forest creatures on the tart giving a lively vibe, there are no visible facial features such as eyes or a smile on the tart itself, which would give it an anthropomorphic appearance. Successfully spotting facial features like eyes and a smile would confirm anthropomorphism, which isn't the case here.",
