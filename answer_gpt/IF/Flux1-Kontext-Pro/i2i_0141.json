      "question": "Have the couple's backs been designed as a crystal silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the couple’s backs retain their basic shape but appear to have transparent, crystalline characteristics. This suggests a design choice that converts their solid forms into a crystal-like representation. Based on visual cues and common design concepts, they have been transformed into crystal silhouettes where details from their clothing and bodies might be less emphasized. Therefore, the crystallization design accentuates an artistic silhouette rather than full physical details.",

      "question": "Does the design maintain the integrity of the couple's original back shape as silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image, the couple's shapes are still recognizable, maintaining the integrity of their original silhouettes despite the transformation into crystal forms. The shapes remain consistent with human outlines, suggesting careful design work to keep the silhouettes’ integrity intact while adding a new visual style through increased transparency.",

      "question": "Do the couple’s back silhouettes show transparency and reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual characteristics of Image B present the couple's backs as transparent with reflective qualities, evidenced by light passing through them and possibly reflecting off edges in a manner typical of crystal structures. This artistic choice adds an ethereal and elegant element, fitting with common design practices for visually striking features.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surrounding environment (bench, tree, grass) unchanged except for the edited couple’s backs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison between Image B and Image A indicates only the couple's backs have been modified to exhibit crystalline characteristics, while the rest of the environment (bench, tree, grass) maintains its original appearance and composition. This suggests the modification focus was solely on the couple's backs, leaving the rest of the image unchanged.",

      "question": "Does the overall design, featuring the crystal silhouettes of the couple, align with the aesthetic suitable for Valentine's Day gifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's design presents romantic symbolism through the depiction of a couple in a park with their backs transformed into crystal silhouettes. This aligns with aesthetics typically associated with Valentine's Day, emphasizing romance, elegance, and an artistic flair suitable for gifting celebrations focused on love and companionship.",
