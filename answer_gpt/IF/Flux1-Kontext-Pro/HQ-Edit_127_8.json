    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire castle scene enclosed within a transparent glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene clearly shows the castle and the knight contained within a transparent glass orb. This is evident from the reflections and the curvature typical of glass surfaces surrounding the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stone textures on the castle walls visibly smaller and more detailed, consistent with a minified appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle walls show fine details in the stone textures that seem more intricate and consistent with a smaller, detailed model inside a snow globe, which usually emphasizes miniature detailing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knightâ€™s armor and the gate structure rendered in an antique bronze color with visible aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight's armor and parts of the gate appear metallic but have a shiny finish rather than an antique bronze look, and show no explicit aging effects such as patina or weathering depicted. The colors appear more like a polished metal rather than bronze.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, fluttering heraldic flags visible on the battlements of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one flag visible on the top of the castle battlement, and it is not fluttering. This indicates a static appearance rather than multiple, fluttering heraldic flags.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small turrets and crenellated walls arranged in a circular pattern around the base of the glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show additional turret structures or crenellated walls arranged circularly around the base of the orb. The base is more akin to a simple pedestal typical for snow globes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are golden light rays visibly sculpted into the glass of the orb, emanating from behind the castle to simulate a rising sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible golden light rays that seem to be part of the scene inside the orb rather than sculpted into the glass surface. These rays create an effect of emanating light, simulating a sunrise, consistent with the sun's position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
