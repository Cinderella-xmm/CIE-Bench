    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Great Wall and surrounding mountains rendered as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall and the surrounding mountains appear within a snow globe, a common item used for displaying miniatures or dioramas. The distortion due to the spherical shape of the globe and the physical confinement within the globe indicate that this is a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale scene. Snow globes typically contain miniaturized scenes, leading to this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the miniature model of the Great Wall and mountains enclosed within a transparent, spherical snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a typical snow globe structure. The miniature scene of the Great Wall and mountains is enclosed within a spherical cover, which appears transparent as the scenery within is visible. This shape and transparency are indicative of a snow globe, which is often crafted for display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale human figures depicted walking along the Great Wall inside the snow globe, with visible details such as clothing or accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, inside the snow globe, there are small-scale human figures visible on the Great Wall. Their presence is suggested by their appearance as miniatures which maintain visible details like clothing, though not as detailed as in full-scale photos. This implies a level of craftsmanship typical in miniatures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are areas of the landscape inside the snow globe adorned with bright autumn-colored foliage (e.g., red, orange, yellow leaves)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape inside the snow globe, as depicted in Image B, shows foliage that is mostly green, without noticeable autumn colors like red, orange, or yellow. The consistent green shade suggests a different season or a possibly artistic choice in the diorama creation.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible swirling snow effect inside the snow globe, with tiny white particles appearing to float or fall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the examined Image B, there is no visible swirling or falling snow effect within the snow globe. The contents appear static without the characteristic white particles that would indicate a snow effect. This is inconsistent with a typical snow globe action where snow is a key feature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there small, ceramic-looking birds depicted in flight inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small birds within the snow globe that appear to be in flight above the mountains. These birds are consistent with models that might be crafted from ceramic or similar materials used in creating miniatures, and they add dynamic interest to the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a dark wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure on which the snow globe rests is clearly visible and appears to be made of dark wood, typical of bases used for display pieces to ensure stability and aesthetic appeal. The dark wooden texture is evident, confirming this description.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the phrase 'Great Wall Memories' can be clearly seen on the wooden base of the snow globe. This is possibly a brass or metal plate attached to the wooden base, a common practice for labeling or commemorating displayed objects.",
