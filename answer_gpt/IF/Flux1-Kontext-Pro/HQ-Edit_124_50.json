      "question": "Is the horse visibly composed of distinct 3D puzzle pieces with defined edges separating each section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B shows no visible signs of being composed of distinct puzzle pieces. The surface appears seamless and the intricate floral designs are continuous without any interruptions or defined edges that would indicate separate sections. The paint on the horse presents as one contiguous design rather than separated pieces. Thus, based on the visual cues and the nature of the horse's finish, it is not composed of puzzle pieces.",

      "question": "Is the horse enclosed within a wooden-framed display case that has a transparent glass dome covering it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is enclosed within a display case that features transparent sides, likely made of glass. However, there is no glass dome; instead, the glass forms a cube-like shape. The visible wooden structure forms a base and a surrounding frame rather than a dome. Thus, the horse is encased in a display case without a dome.",

      "question": "Does the display case rest on a textured wooden base that shows natural wood grain or carving details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the display case clearly rests on a wooden base that exhibits the natural grain and texture of wood. The detailing on the base suggests craftsmanship, with visible wood grain patterns and potential carving details enhancing its aesthetic. Therefore, the base indeed shows wood texture and natural grain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the intricate floral patterns on the horse fragmented across individual puzzle sections, with no single piece showing a complete motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the horse are continuous and not segmented into puzzle pieces. The motifs are fully visible across larger areas without division, indicating unified artwork rather than fragmented sections. Therefore, the patterns do not appear fragmented or incomplete as puzzle pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a vintage-style compass embedded or placed on the wooden base of the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A detailed component resembling a vintage-style compass is visibly embedded in the wooden base of the display case in Image B. The circular object with ornate accents suggests the style and function of a compass, enhancing the overall antique appearance of the display. Therefore, the compass is indeed present on the base.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base features accents that mirror antique-brass coloring, particularly around the circular compass element. These decorative details contribute to the antique look and suggest the inclusion of fixtures with such coloration. Thus, antique-brass colored accents are present on the case or base.",
