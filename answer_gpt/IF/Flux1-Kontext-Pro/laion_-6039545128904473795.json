      "question": "Is the central body of the drone redesigned to resemble a robotic face with sharp, angular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the drone maintains the original structure seen in Image A with the angular design meant for an aerodynamic look. There are no prominent features resembling a robotic face; it still looks like a typical quadcopter drone with its angular geometries for design aesthetics rather than mimicking a face. Therefore, based on the visual cues, the central body design does not intend to resemble a robotic face.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rotor blades replaced with arm-like structures that appear to be capable of rotation and are positioned as if in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone maintains the original rotor blades similar to Image A. They are positioned as drone blades, not as arm-like structures. These are standard quadcopter rotor blades designed for vertical lift. Thus, the rotor blades haven't been replaced with arm-like structures; they are still rotational blades.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original landing gears replaced with multiple spider-like mechanical legs extending from the drone’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the drone's landing gear as consistent with what is typically found on quadcopter drones, akin to the landing gear view in Image A. They are not replaced with spider-like mechanical legs. The landing structure remains standard without an extension into legs that mimic spider appendages.",

      "question": "Is the character shown in mid-flight above a detailed futuristic cityscape with high-rise buildings and advanced urban elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the drone in a setting that appears to be a futuristic environment, with visible high-rise buildings and urban elements consistent with advanced urban visualization. The cityscape looks to be a modern or futuristic depiction, indicating a setting above such a landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character exhibit a sleek metallic surface with reflective textures, chrome finishes, or glowing highlights indicating a metallic aura?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drone in Image B appears to have a slightly metallic aura compared to the matte finish in Image A. While it doesn't possess extremely reflective textures or chrome finishes, the lighting and color adjustments give it a more lustrous appearance. Thus, it exhibits a level of sleek, metallic surface though not overly reflective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble present with the text “Secure the Quantum Core!” written in a bold, tech-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a speech bubble present on the right side with the text “Secure the Quantum Core!” indeed styled in a tech-like font, consistent with visuals often used in futuristic or technological themes. This addition contrasts with Image A where no such text exists.",
