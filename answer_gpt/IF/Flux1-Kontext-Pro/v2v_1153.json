      "explanation": "Image B presents a street view with cherry blossoms framing the scene and a pagoda in the background, consistent with traditional landscape views.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings and scene elements such as the pagoda and cherry blossoms maintain a traditional appearance without any futuristic characteristics. Thus, there is no evident contrast between futuristic and traditional designs; instead, the elements are uniformly traditional. The lack of futuristic architecture means there isn't a contrast present in the image.",
