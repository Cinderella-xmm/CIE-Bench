      "question": "Has the antique clock been transformed into a sentient, mechanical creature resembling a steampunk sentinel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the clock has been transformed into a creature with mechanical attributes like clawed appendages and a tail, which are typical of steampunk aesthetics. These additions give it a sentient appearance, similar to a character or sentinel from a steampunk universe. This conclusion is drawn by observing the anthropomorphic features added to the clock such as arms, claws, and possibly a tail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there gear-based limb-like appendages extending from the clock’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock features limb-like structures resembling arms that are reminiscent of mechanical or gear-based systems. This is evident from the presence of jointed appendages, which appear like arms equipped with claws, hinting at a mechanical or robotic design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has one of the clock faces been replaced with a monocled eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no monocled eye replacing a clock face; instead, the clock retains its circular face at the front. The transformation focuses on adding mechanical limbs and other elements but does not include the addition of an eye in place of the clock face.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum remains part of the clock's internal mechanism and is not extended into a tail-like structure. Instead, the transformation involves the addition of limbs and claws, and the pendulum remains visually similar to its original functionality.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the transformed clock with a color palette that includes metallic hues typical of brass and copper, enhancing the steampunk appearance. This is visible in the finish of the clock’s body, which reflects these warm metallic tones.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible steam valves protruding from the corners or joints of the clock structure. The transformation includes mechanical limbs and brass coloration but does not depict steam valves.",
