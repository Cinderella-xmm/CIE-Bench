      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background bookshelves in Image B are simplified, with the extent of detail being minimized compared to realistic imagery. Despite this simplification, there are subtle textural elements present that give a sense of aging or wear, such as the hint of grain or fades indicative of old paper or wood. This balance of detail retains the essence of bookshelves while maintaining the illustrated style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B has a textured appearance with a color palette reminiscent of antique or sepia tones, which conveys the impression of aged paper.
