      "question": "Is the palm tree and cactus positioned within the frame of a Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible human hands that are holding a photograph with distinct Polaroid borders. Inside the photograph, there is a clear depiction of a palm tree and a cactus against a blue sky. The presentation of a Polaroid frame and the act of holding it with hands suggest that the palm tree and cactus are indeed within the Polaroid photograph. This is derived from the visual cues of the white squared frame, typical of instant photos, and the fingers wrapped around it.",

      "question": "Has the cactus been transformed into a 3D chibi-style character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cactus that appears realistic and retains its natural plant characteristics. It lacks any exaggerated features or stylizations that are indicative of a chibi-style character, such as overly large eyes, disproportionate body parts, or animated expressions. The cactus in the photograph remains true to its organic form as opposed to any cartoonish or caricatured representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cactus appear to be stepping out of the Polaroid frame, breaking into the real-world 3D space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is entirely contained within the Polaroid frame held by the hands. There are no parts of the cactus extending beyond the borders of the photograph into the surrounding environment where the hands exist, which would suggest a crossing into the real-world 3D space. The cactus is firmly depicted within the confines of the Polaroid without any visual cues indicating movement beyond its boundaries.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image create a whimsical and surreal effect through the combination of the Polaroid frame, the chibi cactus, and the real-world interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B combines a Polaroid frame and a hand holding it, creating a sense of interplay between a photograph and reality, the cactus remains unchanged and natural rather than chibi. Despite the absence of whimsical transformations on the cactus, the effect of having the photograph being held, juxtaposed with a real-world setting, can still evoke a mild surreal feel. However, it doesn’t match the expectation of whimsical enhancement, particularly as the cactus hasn’t been altered. Thus, while the setup is creative, it lacks strong surreal elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the palm tree is depicted within the Polaroid photograph held by the human hands. It retains its natural appearance, similar to its depiction in a real-world context. There are no enhancements or changes in terms of stylization or alteration to the palm tree's form or presence within the edited image, showing consistency with its original portrayal.",
