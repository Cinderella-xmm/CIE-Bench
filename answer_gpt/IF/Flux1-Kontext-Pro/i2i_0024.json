      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a flat illustration-style tennis-themed chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is illustrated in a simplified, cartoon-like manner typical of chibi stickers, characterized by exaggerated features and a flat, playful design.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the person's pose is similar; the individual holds a tennis racket and has one hand raised in a fist gesture. The consistency of the pose in both the original and the illustration indicates that the person is depicted in the same pose.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration features the person wearing a red dress and a matching white hat, consistent with the attire depicted in Image A. The retention of these specific clothing colors and styles contributes to maintaining the character's identity in the transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket is depicted as a simple shape with black outlines and minimal detail typical of illustrative simplification, as opposed to the more detailed realistic depiction in Image A. This simplification aligns with stylized art techniques.",
