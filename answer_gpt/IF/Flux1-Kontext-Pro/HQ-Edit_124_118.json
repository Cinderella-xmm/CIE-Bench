    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the scene appear as a digitally rendered holographic installation with visible projection-like effects such as transparency, layering, or digital glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene features elements that suggest digital rendering, such as the neon-like glow surrounding the trees and the incorporation of glass panels in the environment. These effects contribute to a digital, holographic appearance, inferred from the visual cues of artificial light blending with natural forms.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as animated light projections on transparent or reflective glass surfaces instead of natural flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presentation of the waterfalls includes reflective effects and an overlay of glass panel lines, suggesting they could be projections rather than natural water flows. This interpretation derives from the digital and holographic feel of the environment, heightened by these projection-like characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees feature visible iridescent, glowing filaments resembling fiber optics embedded within their trunks and branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees display glowing lines and filaments that resemble fiber optics, which simulate a digital or futuristic aesthetic. These luminous features suggest an artificial, iridescent quality, which is typical of digitally enhanced or rendered imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines appear as virtualized, looping structures with light trails or animated effects, forming a kinetic light sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines in Image B have light-infused loops that suggest animation or kinetic movement, akin to a light sculpture. The presence of glowing effects contributes to the impression of virtualized structures, contrasting with natural vines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the environment integrated with futuristic architectural elements such as glass panels, geometric structures, or artificial lighting that blend with the natural forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines natural scenery with elements like glass panels, which are visibly integrated within the environment. The geometric arrangement of these panels, along with the artificial lighting effects, indicates a blend of futuristic architectural elements with natural forms, creating a harmonious and advanced aesthetic.",
