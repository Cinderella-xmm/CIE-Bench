      "question": "Is the entire lighthouse scene enclosed within a spherical glass or transparent globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse scene is depicted as being encased within what appears to be a perfectly spherical transparent structure. This is evident from the glossy reflections and refractions seen on the surface surrounding the lighthouse, a typical characteristic of a glass or clear material. The encompassing nature of this sphere suggests it is a globe containing the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lighthouse inside the globe depicted as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighthouse inside the globe in Image B appears to be of a scale inconsistent with a full-size structure, relative to the surroundings and the base it sits upon. The portrayal of the scene within a globe, commonly used for miniaturization, supports the conclusion that the lighthouse is a miniature 3D model.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves around the lighthouse inside the globe made of translucent blue resin with a stylized appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waves depicted in the globe inside Image B have a highly stylized and vivid appearance, showing strong translucence and deep blue hues typical of materials like resin used in artistic models for creating the illusion of water.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base supporting the globe in Image B is clearly wooden, with a carved design visible that appears to depict a compass rose. This feature is detailed and prominent against the polished wooden surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a landscape with prominently painted clouds and a mountain range, providing a scenic backdrop consistent with a natural panorama view beyond the globe.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the scene inside the globe includes rocks that show earthy shades of brown and green, while the water is presented in vibrant, deep blues, creating contrast and mimicking a natural scene within the confines of the spherical display.",
