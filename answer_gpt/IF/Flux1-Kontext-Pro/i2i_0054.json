      "question": "Is the background changed to a matte solid gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a uniform and featureless matte solid gray. This visual feature indicates a deliberate change from a complex background that typically contains various natural elements and textures to a simple and minimalistic setting. Such a change is common in artistic edits to direct focus to the subject alone, removing environmental distractions.",

      "question": "Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows can be observed around the feet of the elephant statue on the floor. The presence of shadows indicates a light source applied in the image, which creates depth and suggests a three-dimensional representation. Shadows are common in rendered images to emphasize realism in the object.",

      "question": "Are the banana shape and metal stand curves highlighted effectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curves of the elephant sculpture and the small metal stand (or ring) lying near the elephant's feet are prominently outlined and defined. The smooth curves are emphasized by the lighting and shadow effects, which provide clear visibility and definition to shapes, crucial for aesthetic appeal and design clarity.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a minimalistic design without unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a minimalistic approach with a solid gray background and focuses solely on the sculpture of the elephant and a small object on the floor. There are no additional distracting elements, such as other animals or natural settings, which supports a clutter-free and balanced composition in line with minimalistic design principles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the combination of a plain background, careful lighting to highlight the object, and absence of excessive details or other distracting elements aligns well with the principles of minimalistic design. The focus remains solely on the subject (the elephant and small object on the floor), which is typical for assets in a minimalist design approach.",
