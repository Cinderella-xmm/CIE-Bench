    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the compass been transformed into a bottle-shaped object with a distinct body, neck, and cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a bottle with a clear distinction between the body, neck, and cap. The overall structure visually suggests a bottle-like shape. This appearance combined with common knowledge about bottles, which characteristically have these parts, confirms the transformation of the compass into a bottle-shaped object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object a circular glass-like container with the compass face visible as an embossed or raised pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the object in Image B appears to be a circular glass-like container. The compass face is not an embossed or raised pattern; instead, it is displayed flat and visible inside the transparent structure of the body. This design choice maintains the compass's flat face visibility while housed in the glass-like container.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the compass needle been replaced with a metal spray nozzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a compass with its needle still intact, serving its traditional function. There is no indication of a metal spray nozzle replacing the needle, as the needle is a central element of the compass's function and design, reflecting standard compass structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cap of the object feature an engraving resembling a vintage map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap of the bottle has engraved designs. However, these engravings resemble a decorative pattern or logo more than a vintage map. Vintage maps typically include geographical outlines, landscapes, or detailed lines, none of which are present on the cap.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an object with a bronze tone and gradient finish which gives it an aged, antique appearance. This finish is typical of objects designed to look vintage or historical, often used to evoke grandeur and timelessness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon closer inspection, Image B reveals small inscriptions that resemble text or logos around the rim of the compass bottle. These minimalist branding details align with typical product design features that incorporate subtle yet informative branding.",
