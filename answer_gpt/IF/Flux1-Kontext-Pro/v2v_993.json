      "question": "Is the character designed as a stylized 3D chibi version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A chibi character typically features exaggerated, cartoonish proportions, such as a large head and small body, common in manga and anime styles. In Image B, the character appears with normal human proportions rather than a stylized chibi form, suggesting the design is not 3D or stylized as a chibi version.",
