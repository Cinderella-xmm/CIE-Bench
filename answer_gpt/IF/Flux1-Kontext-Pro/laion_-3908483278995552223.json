    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Aquatic warrior rendered as a three-dimensional model rather than a flat 2D image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior appears to be a 3D model, as it is positioned within a clear dome, giving the impression of volume and dimensionality. This differs from a flat, 2D image and is indicative of 3D rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior enclosed within a dome that features marine-themed decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the Aquatic warrior inside a dome. The dome includes elements resembling sea creatures and blue waves, which directly point towards marine-themed decorations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the armor of the Aquatic warrior rendered in metallic blue tones with visible reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior's armor lacks metallic blue tones and instead has a predominantly metallic gray appearance, similar to the armor's style in Image A. Therefore, reflective highlights in blue are not discernible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the trident maintain its large, dominant size and detailed structure relative to the Aquatic warrior's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates the trident with a similar proportional dominance and detailed structure as seen alongside the Aquatic warrior, echoing its stance in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the 3D model placed on a base that resembles a coral reef made of artificial or stylized coral structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base within the dome consists of stylized structures, which strongly resemble artificial coral reefs, typical in marine displays. This contrasts with Image A that lacks such elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible swirling shapes around the Aquatic warrior in the dome, indicating water currents and dynamic movement which add to the marine-themed setting.",
