      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin visibly transformed into bark-covered limbs with naturalistic textures and irregular shapes resembling tree trunks or branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin's walls appear to be transformed into elements resembling tree trunks or branches, as indicated by the irregular shapes and textures that mimic natural growth and bark.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows windows that have been replaced with unusual features resembling eyes that emit glowing amber light, creating a mystical appearance.

      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no clear indications of mystical rune carvings etched into the logs of the cabin. The transformation focuses on organic and forest-like features rather than personalization with mystical symbols. Comparatively, Image A features plain logs without any carvings at all.",
