      "question": "Does the image display a soft hand-painted texture characteristic of watercolor illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall appearance has a soft and blended texture, lacking the sharpness typically seen in photographs. This texture is reminiscent of watercolor illustrations, which are characterized by their fluid transitions and subtle variations in color due to the medium's nature. The edges in Image B are not rigid and appear as if they have been slightly washed out or blurred, which is typical of watercolor art.",

      "question": "Are the bedding patterns from the original image preserved in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the recognizable patterns on the bedding, such as the geometric shapes and arrangement of colors, are still visible and match those seen in Image A. Despite the transformation into a watercolor style, these patterns are preserved, allowing for easy comparison between the two images.",

      "question": "Do the colors in the image exhibit a soft blending typical of watercolor paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors appear to gradually transition into one another, lacking the distinct separations seen in polished photographs such as Image A. This visual characteristic is a hallmark of watercolor paintings, where colors are often mixed on the paper, creating a blurrier and softer appearance compared to crisp digital images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible brush stroke textures or subtle variations in shading throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays characteristics of brush stroke textures, as seen in watercolor artworks. There are subtle variations in shading across surfaces, and the edges have irregularities that mimic brush strokes. This is different from Image A, which has a uniformly clear and even distribution of color. The handmade quality of Image B indicates the use of a watercolor effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can detailed designs in the bedding, like the star patterns, still be clearly seen after conversion to the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed designs on the bedding, such as the star patterns, are less distinct compared to Image A. While the overall shapes and patterns are recognizable, they are softened and less defined due to the watercolor effect, which tends to blur detailed edges.",
