    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented as a three-dimensional shadow box diorama with visible depth created by layered components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is presented within a dark frame, suggesting it is part of a display. The objects within the frame present a layered arrangement. The visual elements, such as the layered skyline and the shadow effects, simulate depth, which indicates it could be a shadow box diorama designed to create a perception of depth typically through layered components. World knowledge of such dioramas often includes these characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the skyline and foreground elements visibly separated into multiple layered paper cut-out sections to simulate depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a composition where different elements appear to be layered and separated spatially, which is characteristic of a shadow box style diorama. This separation creates an impression of depth and three-dimensionality, akin to layered paper cut-outs. The sky, the Eiffel Tower, and the foreground all appear to be positioned in layers that enhance the perception of depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the grassy lawn area been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface that shows reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region in front of the Eiffel Tower still appears to be a grassy lawn, similar to Image A. The visual does not show a reflective or mirror-like surface, as the texture and color resemble grass rather than a reflective surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there numerous small, detailed, three-dimensional-looking pedestrian figures scattered throughout the scene, particularly on pathways and near the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are numerous miniature figures that give the impression of being three-dimensional, scattered across the pathways and near the tower's base. Their size and shadowing suggest attempts to create a detailed scene with depth, consistent with the style of a shadow box diorama.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene framed by a dark border with visible metallic edges, consistent with a shadow box enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is surrounded by a border that appears dark and solid, although from visual cues alone, itâ€™s difficult to definitively indicate metallic edges. However, it supports the notion of an enclosed diorama or shadow box, which often has such a framing element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are city names and geographic coordinates visibly engraved along the outer edge of the frame in fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame surrounding the scene does not show any visible engravings or markings such as city names or geographic coordinates along its outer edge. A close observation indicates a plain design.",
