        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character in front of a tan-colored wall with a drainpipe, which matches the setting in Image A. The consistent details such as the wall color, texture, drainpipe design, and positioning confirm that the environment is the same.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the umbrella is large compared to the character's size and features a bright, rainbow color pattern. This oversized, colorful design is characteristic of objects in a chibi-style setting, which often employs exaggerated and vibrant elements for a playful effect.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The raindrops in Image B appear with a slight whimsical quality as they splash around the drainpipe and umbrella. While not an overtly playful depiction, their movement and reflections contribute to a dynamic and lively environment that complements the chibi character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
