      "question": "Have the heads of the three individuals been made slightly bigger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues in Image B, the heads of the three individuals seem proportionately larger in comparison to their bodies than would typically be expected, suggesting a slight exaggeration in size. This perception may arise from comparing general human body proportions where the head is normally about one-eighth of the total height.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the facial features of the three individuals appear blurred, which results in a lack of detail in facial features or accessories. Typically, precise details would involve clear visualization, which is not the case here.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the log cabin appears proportionate to the individuals when considering typical architectural scale compared to human size. The cabin's size relative to the individuals is what would be expected in a real-world setting, indicating an appropriate scale.",
