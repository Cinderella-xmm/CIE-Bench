      "question": "Is the bed fully constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, including the frame, mattress, and base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed clearly shows traits of a construct made from interlocking bricks. The visual texture resembles the pattern of LEGO, where the surface is not smooth and shows outlines of individual pieces, especially on the side of the mattress and other visible structures. Comparing this to Image A, where everything is smooth and continuous without any line segmentation, it becomes evident that Image B is indeed constructed from identifiable LEGO-like pieces.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are white and light blue LEGO bricks used to recreate the botanical pattern visible on the original bedding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the bedding shows a patchwork pattern that seems to match the layout of LEGO bricks. Light blue accents can be made out amidst the white bricks, hinting at an attempt to replicate a pattern. In Image A, the pattern is composed in a detailed and regular fashion consistent with botanical designs. The comparison shows an effort in Image B to use white and light blue bricks to mimic this design, if not in detailed accuracy then at least in a similar color palette.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the headboard been replaced with smooth, curved LEGO pieces to create a rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a headboard that appears curved and smooth, contrary to the blocky, ordinary shape common in LEGO constructions. In Image A, the headboard maintains a straight and flat design. The rounded headboard in Image B suggests the use of specialized curved LEGO pieces, consistent with techniques applied to simulate curves in modular building sets.",

      "question": "Are the pillows made from stacked smaller LEGO bricks, giving them a distinct three-dimensional structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows appear more segmented and ridged, indicative of smaller LEGO pieces being used to form a three-dimensional structure. This contrasts with Image A, where the pillows are seamless and fluffy, demonstrating typical fabric characteristics. This difference implies Image B uses smaller, stacked LEGO bricks to recreate the pillows’ form.",

    {

      "question": "Is the background of the edited image the same grayscale as the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the background retains a consistent grayscale tone, matching the ambiance of Image A. There are no differences in the background’s shade or texture between the two images, affirming that they share the same background styling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bed appear playful due to visible brick construction and structured due to orderly arrangement and clear modular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible brick construction in Image B, evidenced by interlocking pieces and segmented lines, lends the bed a playful, toy-like quality. This playful aspect is further emphasized by the use of varied colors and modules that align neatly. The orderly arrangement and modular design of LEGO bricks result in a structured appearance, blending a sense of playfulness with order. This differs from Image A, which emphasizes smoothness and realism in design.",
