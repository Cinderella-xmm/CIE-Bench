    "Question": "Q5: Is the Sphinx still positioned in the same location relative to the background elements (such as the pyramid and sunset), with the sun disc correctly placed where the head was?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the general positioning relative to the background elements such as the pyramid and sunset remains consistent, the sun disc is not placed where the head of the Sphinx was.
