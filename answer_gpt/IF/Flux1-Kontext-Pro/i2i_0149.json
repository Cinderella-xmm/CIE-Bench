      "question": "Does the cat’s head extend slightly beyond the frame edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cat's head is fully contained within the frame, without extending beyond any edges. Visually, the head sits comfortably within the boundaries of the image. No parts of the ears, forehead, or chin appear to be cut off or jutting out of the image borders.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curled tongue show clear spatial depth, giving a 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cat with its mouth open and its tongue slightly protruding outward, which conveys a sense of depth as the tongue is visibly extending from inside the mouth. The perspective and shading applied to the tongue contribute to a three-dimensional effect, showcasing depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the position and angle of the cat’s head create a visual illusion of peeking out from the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head is positioned centrally, which does not create an illusion of peeking from the frame. The placement is straightforward without any angles or positioning suggesting it is peeking. The cat's direct gaze towards the viewer contributes instead to a frontal view rather than any illusion of peeking.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a natural appearance for the cat, aside from the instructed modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cat with natural fur patterns, realistic lighting, and expressions typical of cats, like an open mouth with visible teeth and tongue. These consistent elements help maintain a natural appearance despite the tongue's position. The modifications do not detract from the overall realistic portrayal of the cat.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edits seamlessly integrated with the rest of the image, with no noticeable artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tongue and open mouth do not present any immediate or obvious signs of artificial edits when matched with the surrounding fur and lighting. The tonal consistency and integration with the rest of the visual features suggest that edits were performed with attention to detail, producing a seamless final image.",
