    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the ballerina depicted as a stone sculpture rather than a living person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the ballerina as a stone sculpture, indicative of the texture and monochromatic color of the surface, which are characteristic of sculptures. This conclusion is drawn from the marble-like appearance and the rigidity of the pose, which is typical of stone statues.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ballerina's garments replaced with intricately folded, draping robes characteristic of classical Greek attire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the ballerina figure wearing garments that resemble draping robes, which are consistent with classical Greek clothing styles. This is identified through the way the fabric is depicted as flowing and structured.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure wear a stylized laurel wreath on her head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis, the figure does not appear to wear a laurel wreath. The hair is styled up, but no wreath or similar adornment is visible. This is derived from what would be typical of Greek statues, but absent in this sculpture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor appears to be a large-tiled marble surface, rather than a mosaic pattern made of small colored tiles, which is indicative of traditional marble flooring rather than intricate mosaic designs.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows elements such as the stone sculpture and the Ionic columns that are consistent with ancient Greek architecture. Other elements appear historically accurate, without any modern interference.",
