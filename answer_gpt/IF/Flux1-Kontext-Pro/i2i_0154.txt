    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain the front view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe multiple views of a black sports car. In particular, the bottom-right segment of the collage provides a clear view of the car from the front. The grille and headlights are prominently visible, which align with commonly known characteristics of a car's front view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image contain the side view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no distinct side view visible. The views predominantly focus on a front three-quarter angle and a frontal image which does not fully showcase the car's side profile.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image contain the top view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, specifically in the bottom-right section, there's a view from above that captures the top view of the car, as seen by the roof and hood being visible. This meets the criteria for it being a top view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the front, side, and top views visibly combined into a single image?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the car in different perspectives: an angled view, a front view, and a top view. However, it does not contain a distinct side view and therefore does not fully combine front, side, and top views into a single combined presentation, as one view is missing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the combined image clear, appropriately scaled, and presented professionally for the specified uses?",
    "explanation": "The collage in Image B is well-organized, with each view of the car appearing sharp and clear. The angles effectively showcase the vehicle's features, and the layout is visually appealing. This suggests that it is professionally composed, meeting common standards for such presentations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
