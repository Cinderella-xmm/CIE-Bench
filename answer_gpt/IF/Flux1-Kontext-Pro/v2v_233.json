      "question": "Is the leaf enclosed within a transparent spherical container resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals the leaf confined within a transparent spherical container. This distinct shape and clarity characterize snow globes, commonly used for decoration. The transparent nature and spherical design align well with typical snow globe structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a surface resembling a tabletop near a window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues from Image B show the snow globe located on a flat horizontal plane, akin to tabletops used for holding objects. Furthermore, the light and window frame in the background imply proximity to a window.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background softly blurred and contains warm tones such as orange or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows a softly blurred background indicating depth of field manipulation to accentuate the leaf and globe. The use of warm hues is evident, with tones of orange or yellow adding a warm ambiance to the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there golden sparkles scattered within the snow globe due to sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays scatterings resembling small golden sparkles around the leaf in the snow globe. These sparkles reflect the warm tone and are scattered, possibly heightened by sunlight interaction, typical in decorative environments.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the leaf appears submerged, showing gentle ripples similar to water movement. While sparkles are present, they aren't drifting like snowflakes seen in snow globes, which would typically suspend due to density, rather than gentle ripple movement.",
