      "question": "Are the sausages, salad, and egg completely replaced by glass tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show distinct tile shapes forming the sausages, salad, and egg areas. Each food item appears as a mosaic made up of several small glass tiles, rather than actual food items, suggesting a complete replacement by glass tiles. This design is common in artistic representations where the mosaic technique is used to create images using colored glass or ceramic tiles.",

      "question": "Are the tiles used for the sausage shapes in warm terracotta tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the sausages as being composed of tiles in an orange hue. Terracotta is often associated with warm, reddish-brown tones, which can include shades of orange as seen in this mosaic artwork. The warm color tone fits the common understanding of terracotta shades, indicating the tiles for the sausages may indeed fall into the terracotta spectrum.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiles forming the salad in leafy green colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the salad is depicted using tiles that range in shades of green. Leafy salad greens are typically understood to exhibit varying shades of green, from light to dark hues. The tiles reflect these typical leafy colors, supporting the conclusion that the salad is formed using leafy green-colored tiles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the egg-shaped area composed of round tiles in sunny yellow tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The egg in Image B demonstrates a predominantly circular tile pattern where the yolk is represented in a bright, sunny yellow tone. Typically, artistic depictions of eggs would illustrate the yolk in this vivid color, and the image follows such a depiction using glass tiles to construct the form and color of the yolk area.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tiles used for the sausages visibly larger than those used for the lettuce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages are represented using fewer and larger tile pieces compared to the lettuce area, which features smaller and more numerous tiles. This visual distinction suggests the tiles for the sausages are indeed larger than those used for the lettuce, consistent with the size difference between the real objects these tiles represent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the mosaic composition arranged symmetrically on a plain ceramic background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B has a well-organized layout with clearly defined sections for each food item, the mosaic doesn't appear perfectly symmetrical nor is it arranged on a plain ceramic background. Rather, the mosaic sections display varied shapes and sizes that contribute to visual interest, but do not exhibit strict symmetry, and the background itself is composed of many tiles rather than a plain surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image display a vibrant and artistically cohesive mosaic design using glass tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cohesive arrangement of colored tiles that creatively represent food items like sausages, salad, and egg. The use of vivid colors, organized tile patterns, and the mosaic technique contribute to an overall vibrant and artistic design, consistent with mosaics being an artistic medium known for visual unity and vibrancy.",
