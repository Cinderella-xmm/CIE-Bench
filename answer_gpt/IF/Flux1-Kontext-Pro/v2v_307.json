      "question": "Does the packaging resemble a Funko Pop figure box in design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Funko Pop figure boxes typically have a specific design that includes a viewing window on the front, a recognizable logo, and artwork representing the character inside the box. Based on world knowledge, these boxes often have cartoon-like illustrations, a prominent logo 'POP!' with an exclamation mark, and a front window to display the figure. In Image B, the packaging prominently features the 'POP!' logo, a window from which the bandage is displayed, and cartoon artwork of a bandage, making it resemble a Funko Pop box design.",

      "question": "Is the text \"HEALING ESSENTIALS\" visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By closely observing Image B, the text 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' is clearly printed on the box under the POP logo. Based on common knowledge, product packaging usually contains prominent text indicating the product's identity or theme, which in this case is displayed at the front of the box.",

      "question": "Is the packaging illustrated from an isometric perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An isometric perspective typically involves a three-dimensional representation where dimensions along the X, Y, and Z axes are visible, giving depth to the image. Image B is not presented in an isometric perspective; it shows the front side of the packaging flatly and straightforwardly without any angles that suggest depth in three dimensions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bandage inside the packaging have a chibi-style representation with oversized stitching and a cartoonish adhesive area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style illustrations usually present characters or objects with exaggerated features, like oversized heads or eyes, small bodies, and cartoonish details. In Image B, the box illustration shows a bandage character with stylistic cartoon enhancements, evident from the large illustration of a bandage with simplistic features fitting the chibi style, but the bandage itself does not have oversized stitching or cartoonish adhesive area. Instead, these elements are visually more aligned toward realism.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a realistic version of the bandage displayed outside the packaging, showing intricate details like fabric texture and adhesive surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the bandage outside the box is shown with detailed textural elements that reflect light, showcasing fabric texture and the adhesive surface's realistic features. This differentiates it from the cartoon-like illustration within the packaging, indicating a realistic rendering of the object.",
