    "Question": "Q1: Does the elephant appear as a 3D chibi-style desktop figurine?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a 3D figurine or model of an elephant placed on a round base. The elephant's proportions, with a slightly exaggerated head and shorter limbs, are consistent with chibi-style designs, characterized by cute, compact proportions. This style is commonly used in creating collectible figurines or models. The visual cues, such as the scale and design, suggest a desktop-sized model rather than a lifelike representation.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the materials used matte polymer clay for the figurine and a transparent acrylic dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant figurine exhibits a matte finish typical of polymer clay models, characterized by a lack of gloss or shine. There are no visual cues suggesting a transparent acrylic dome covering the figurine, as it is photographed openly on a plain background. Such domes are often included in collectible display products to protect and showcase the figurine, but Image B lacks this element.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall style consistent with product photography composition?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a clean background with focused lighting and a centered composition, common attributes in product photography designed to highlight the subject. The presentation aims to emphasize the details and design elements of the figurine and base, creating an impression of a promotional or commercial image. Product photography often has a minimalist approach to draw attention to the item being advertised, which is evident here.",
