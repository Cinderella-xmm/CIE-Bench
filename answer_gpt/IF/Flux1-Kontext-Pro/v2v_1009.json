      "question": "Is the bowl made of a transparent glass-like material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl appears to be made of transparent material, as evidenced by the glass-like appearance around the rim and the visibility of the vegetables through the sides of the bowl. The transparency suggests that the material is likely glass or a similar clear substance. This is reinforced by the reflection and refraction of light observed in the bowl, typical of glass objects.",

      "question": "Do the vegetables have a fresh and slightly damp surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables, including the carrot slices and cauliflower, exhibit a surface texture that is slightly glossy, which usually indicates freshness and a slightly moist surface. This visual cue is common for freshly prepared vegetables, which tend to retain a bit of moisture on their surface, giving them a fresh and appetizing appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image show angled lighting from above with soft ambient fill, creating highlights and soft shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates lighting from above, as seen by the shadows cast by the vegetables inside the bowl and the highlights on the sides of the cauliflower florets. The soft shadows suggest that the lighting is diffused, providing an ambient fill that creates gentle contrasts rather than harsh lines. This results in a balanced illumination across the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a neutral gray with a subtle vignette gradient and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that appears neutral gray and seems uniformly smooth, though there is no obvious visible vignette gradient. It maintains a consistent color without noticeable variations or gradients toward the edges. Hence, while it has a smooth texture and neutral color, the lack of a gradient effect means it doesn't match all parts of the description exactly.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the vegetables naturally vibrant with a soft glow effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the vegetables, such as the oranges of the carrots and the whites of the cauliflower, appear naturally vibrant. They exhibit a clarity and intensity typically seen in well-lit images, yet there is no presence of a specialized glow effect; rather, they display natural color saturation and lighting. The vibrancy is a result of the lighting conditions rather than digital enhancement or glow effects.",
