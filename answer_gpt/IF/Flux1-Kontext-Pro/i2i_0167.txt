    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image include the apple's current front view as originally shown?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top-left quadrant shows the apple in the same position as the original Image A, indicating the same front view depiction. By combining visual cues and world knowledge, we recognize the consistency in the apple's position and orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is there a cross-section view of the apple that shows its inner flesh texture and seeds?",
    "explanation": "The top-right and bottom-left quadrants in Image B display the apple cut in half, revealing the inner flesh and seeds. Based on visual recognition and understanding of an apple's anatomy, these views clearly show these features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image contain a top view that clearly displays the apple's stem structure and calyx area?",
    "explanation": "The bottom-right quadrant of Image B shows the apple from a top-down perspective, highlighting the stem and calyx area. This perspective utilizes visual understanding and knowledge of apple morphology to determine it exhibits the top view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the current front view of the apple remained unchanged compared to the original image?",
    "explanation": "By comparing Image A and the top-left quadrant of Image B, the apple's position, lighting, and shadow appear consistent across both images. The frontal view remains similar, supporting the conclusion that no significant changes occurred.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cross-section of the apple reveal both the flesh texture and seeds accurately?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cross-section views in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants reveal the apple's flesh texture and seeds recognizable by their natural appearance, as seen in typical apple slices. The clarity of these components aligns with world knowledge of how they should appear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
