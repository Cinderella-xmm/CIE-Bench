      "question": "Is there a visible logo placed on the handle of the hammer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a logo visible on the handle of the hammer. This is discerned through visual inspection where text or logo-like designs can be seen on the hammer handle, suggesting branding or a manufacturer's mark. Given that craftsman tools often feature such logos for identification or brand recognition, the presence of this element is logical.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there elegant, readable typographic elements displayed directly on the wood shavings scattered across the workbench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an inspection of the wood shavings scattered across the workbench does not show any typographic elements. Typically, wood shavings are irregular and text would not naturally be found among them unless deliberately placed, which is not the case here based on the image content.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a horizontal rustic textured banner positioned at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible horizontal rustic textured banner at the top of the image. The top section of the image is occupied by the pegboard with tools dangling from it, and there are no additional banner elements present.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the pegboard in grayscale with visible copper-colored accents on tools or hardware?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pegboard is a dark gray or black color. While this could be considered grayscale, there are no copper-colored accents on the tools or hardware that would create a contrast typical of such a description. The tools appear metallic or wooden, consistent with standard workshop imagery.",

      "question": "Is there a sleek, minimalist business card visible behind the tools on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indeed shows what appears to be a sleek, minimalist business card behind the tools on the pegboard. This is evident from the rectangular card with typographic elements resembling text typical of a business card. Such cards are often used for professional or branding purposes and fit the observed context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all original tools visible and retained in their original positions on the pegboard?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the tools' arrangement in Image A and Image B reveals some changes. For instance, some tools have moved slightly or been replaced by other objects, such as the addition of a card in Image B. Thus, not all tools from Image A are retained in their original positions in Image B.",
