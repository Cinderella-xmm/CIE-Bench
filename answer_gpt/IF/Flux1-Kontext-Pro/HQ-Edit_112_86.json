      "question": "Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a teapot that appears to be crafted from a transparent material that strongly resembles glass. Its clarity and reflective properties suggest it is indeed made of clear glass. This observation is based on the visible transparency and the way light interacts with its surface. Image A displays a metal teapot, but for Image B, the teapot being made of clear glass is evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the teapot transparent, allowing visibility through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot exhibits a see-through quality, characteristic of glass, allowing one to perceive the opposite side and surroundings through the teapot itself. This transparency is distinct and signifies that it permits visibility through the material. Comparatively, Image A is a metallic teapot which is opaque and doesn't allow visibility through it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B has floral patterns that appear frosted, giving a texture and appearance similar to engraved designs. These patterns closely resemble the motif of roses and leaves found on the surface of the teapot in Image A, which are metallic engravings. Both images share similar floral designs, though differing in material and finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the handle and spout made of tinted amber glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle and spout in Image B have a distinct amber hue, suggesting they are crafted from tinted glass. The coloration is visible and contrasts with the clear body of the teapot, indicating a deliberate choice of tinted amber glass. Image A features a metallic handle and spout without this tint, highlighting the difference.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored surface showing a clear reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the teapot in Image B is positioned on a surface that shows a clear reflection of the teapot's design and patterns. This mirroring effect indicates it's placed on a reflective surface like a mirror. In Image A, the teapot is on a wooden surface, absent of such reflections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the teapot retain the same level of detail and design as the original engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the medium has changed from metal engravings in Image A to frosted glass patterns in Image B, the floral designs retain their intricate detailing and recognizable motifs like the roses and leaves. This suggests that the level of detail and design is preserved, albeit in a different material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original shape and proportions of the original metallic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B retains the same shape, including the proportions of the spout, handle, and lid as seen in Image A, despite the change in material. This likeness in form indicates that the edited teapot respects the original dimensions and overall design.",
