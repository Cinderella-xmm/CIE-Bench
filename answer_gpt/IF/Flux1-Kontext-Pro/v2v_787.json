      "question": "Does the character retain the original facial details and pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is blurred, similar to Image A. However, the pose remains the same, with the character standing upright with a hand in the pocket. Given the blurred face and unchanged pose, the character does not retain original facial details but does maintain the same pose.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the character retains realistic human proportions rather than the exaggerated features typical of chibi characters. There are no long-legged proportions characteristic of chibi designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is dressed in stylish clothing, specifically a burnt orange blouse and green trousers. The outfit incorporates elements that could be considered chic. However, there are no glasses or a tablet visible on the character itself. These items appear on the right side as part of the ensemble breakdown.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays clothing and accessories on the right side that effectively match the color scheme of green and burnt orange seen on the character. The items shown include blazers, skirts, glasses, a clutch, and shoes, all coordinated with these colors, suggesting a fashion-forward ensemble.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, it does not appear to have an aspect ratio of 9:16. The text 'OOTD' is at the top, similar to commonly shared hashtag tags for fashion, but the character is not chibi-style. Instead, it features a realistic full-body photo of the character on the left, alongside a breakdown of clothing and accessories on the right.",
