      "question": "Is the clock tower in the edited image exaggerated and elongated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower is illustrated with a more stylized representation. It looks taller relative to the flowerbeds than it might naturally be, and the simplified lines and proportions enhance the effect that it's been exaggerated and elongated, which is common in stylized illustrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to be a vertical representation akin to a metal badge. The outline and shading give the impression of metallic edges, and the colors are presented with a gloss characteristic of enamel badges, highlighting the reflective quality.",
