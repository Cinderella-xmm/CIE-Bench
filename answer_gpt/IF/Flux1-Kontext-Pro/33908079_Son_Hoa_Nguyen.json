      "question": "Has the worker been cartoonized with slightly exaggerated or simplified features compared to the original photo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style of the worker is distinctly illustrative, with smoother lines and less detailed texture compared to the more realistic depiction in Image A. This simplification of features is characteristic of a cartoonized effect. The worker's figure seems to be translated into a drawing with uniform color application and less complexity, typical of cartoons.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the workerâ€™s hands visibly enlarged in proportion to the rest of the body to emphasize the tea-picking action?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the worker in an illustrative style, and in many illustrative depictions, artists often exaggerate or stylize certain body parts to convey actions or expressions more emphatically. The hands do appear to have a slight emphasis, contributing to the action of picking, but they remain proportional without noticeable enlargement.",

      "question": "Do the tea plantation fields display vibrant green and earthy tones as the dominant color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea fields are depicted with enhanced green tones that appear to be vibrant and earthy, suitable for emphasizing a lush, fertile environment. Compared to Image A, where the greens are more varied in tone due to lighting and photographic effects, the illustration in Image B unifies the color into consistent vivid greens, typical in artistic renditions of nature scenes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the sack remains consistent with simplified illustrations, without a shiny or metallic appearance. The coloring is flat, typical of illustrations, as opposed to employing a gold foil effect, which would imply reflective and textured qualities.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes decorative borders with vine patterns around the main illustration, creating an ornamental frame that is typical in scrapbook or album-style presentations. This addition enhances the artistic feel of the displayed work.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is presented within a frame that resembles an album or scrapbook. The background or frame looks textured, mimicking recycled paper which adds to the overall impression of a handmade or environmentally-conscious presentation style.",
