      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal box prominently features a gorilla holding a large bunch of bananas as the central artwork. This is evident from the centered position of the image on the box's front and its size relative to the rest of the design elements. The gorilla with bananas serves as the main visual focus, an effective way to catch consumers' attention by integrating animal imagery related to the cerealâ€™s theme. Since Image B is evaluating the overall design related to the cereal theme, using an animal like a gorilla, which is often associated with bananas, creates a visual connection and enhances thematic representation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall color scheme of the cereal box is dominated by vibrant green and yellow tones. The background is a rich green, which aligns with the jungle theme, while the bananas and highlights incorporate bright yellow. This choice of color not only supports the jungle aesthetic but also aligns with the visual theme of bananas being the primary element linked with the product. Bright and contrasting colors are often used in packaging to attract attention and convey freshness and natural flavors, which are typical expectations for cereal packaging.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features banana motifs with the gorilla holding a large bunch of bananas, which directly serves as the design's focal point. The surrounding background includes leafy tropical accents, as evidenced by the detailed depiction of jungle foliage and hanging vines. These elements work together to reinforce the cereal's theme and market the product as jungle-related, which can appeal to consumers looking for tropical or fruit-based cereal.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, only the front side of the cereal box is visible, displaying the gorilla with bananas and the text 'Jungle Crunch.' There is no view or information provided about the back of the cereal box. Thus, it cannot be determined if a playful jungle illustration along with fun facts about gorillas and their habitats is included.",
