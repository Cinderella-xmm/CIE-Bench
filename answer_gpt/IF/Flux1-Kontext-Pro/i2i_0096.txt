    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image show a left-side 90-degree view of the sofa alongside the front view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the view presented appears to be a frontal view of the sofa, confirmed by the symmetry and alignment of the cushions and seating. There are no visual cues indicating a simultaneous left-side 90-degree view, as the armrests and design are consistent with a standard frontal view. The edited image does not reveal any dual perspective, such as a combination of front and side views of the sofa, suggesting a singular perspective.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the dimensions of the sofa consistent between the front and left-side views?",
    "explanation": "Since Image B shows a frontal view of the sofa and does not feature a left-side 90-degree view, evaluating the consistency of dimensions between two different perspectives is not applicable. The dimensions are consistent within the frontal view alone, with no contrasting perspective visible in the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition between the front and side views of the sofa smooth and coherent?",
    "explanation": "A smooth transition between the front and side views of the sofa implies visible components from both angles, which is not evident in Image B. The view in Image B remains static and frontal, leaving no transition to assess between separate viewpoints.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the lighting and shadows on the sofa consistent in both the front and side views?",
    "explanation": "Image B reflects lighting and shadows consistent with a frontal view of the sofa. With the absence of a side view, there is no basis for comparing lighting consistency between two perspectives. Shadows and light fall uniformly as expected in a direct frontal view without irregularities or variations suggesting a side perspective.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do objects around the sofa (e.g., wall art) appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the combined view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall art and the sofa are aligned within a consistent frontal view framework. Objects are proportionate and scaled to fit the spatial dynamics of a frontal perspective; however, without a composite view incorporating a side perspective, judgment on relative positioning in a non-existent combined view is unnecessary.",
    "answer": "Yes"
