      "question": "Has the image been redesigned into a poster format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a title and a subtitle placed strategically on a dark background, which are common elements in poster design. The use of text to convey a title ('MASTER CHEF') and subtitled ('FINAL ROUND') indicates a redesign intention focused on promoting or announcing an event, which aligns with poster characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is large text at the top that reads 'MASTER CHEF'. The size, placement at the top, and style suggest it's intended as the title, which is a typical use of such text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Below the plate and spoon in Image B, there is a smaller section of text reading 'FINAL ROUND.' Its location and size compared to the main title suggest it functions as a subtitle, providing additional context to the main event or title.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central focus of Image B is a white plate with a spoon on a dark background. The plate and spoon arrangement matches Image A and maintains the same design, regardless of the background and added text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a minimalistic color scheme with black and white, which provides a professional look. The bold fonts and simple graphics are effective for a cooking competition theme, emphasizing the seriousness and prestige of a 'final round'. The stark contrast and placement help draw attention to the theme of a high-stakes cooking competition.",
