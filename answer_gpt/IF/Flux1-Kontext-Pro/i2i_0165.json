      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, on the top section of the refrigerator door, there is clearly visible text reading 'Xu's Fresh Zone'. This indicates that the brand logo or any textual branding information located at the top of the refrigerator has been altered to display this new wording. Typically, this area is reserved for branding, so the appearance of this new text suggests a change from the original branding or logo.",
