      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, it's clear that the eagle is indeed enclosed within a transparent glass dome.

      "question": "Does the eagle appear as a 3D stylized sculpture with sculptural features (e.g., defined form, modeling lines, or material texture)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle exhibits qualities of a 3D sculpture. Its form is visibly defined and rigid, indicating it is not a real bird but a crafted figure. The feathers, beak, and talons have distinct textural details that are characteristic of sculptural work, used to mimic the look of a real eagle. This is typical of decorative sculptures that focus on stylized realism.",
