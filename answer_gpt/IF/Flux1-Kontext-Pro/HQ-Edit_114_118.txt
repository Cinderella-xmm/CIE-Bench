    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a scene clearly enclosed in a glass dome with a wooden base, typical for protecting and displaying small models or miniatures. The transparency of the glass allows us to see the ship and seagulls inside, confirming that the scene is indeed enclosed within a glass dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sails exhibit detailed features such as creases and shadows, giving the impression of papercraft material properties. Papercraft often involves folded or layered paper to create realistic textures, which is evident in the sail's appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, there is indeed a translucent blue layer below the ship, resembling ocean waves. Resin is commonly used in crafts to emulate water due to its reflective and translucent properties, which can be observed here.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B's glass dome scene, the seagulls seem to be suspended, likely by fine wires as suggested. The wires are used in miniature scenes to create a dynamic effect, allowing the seagulls to appear as if they're flying while maintaining a static position.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains a miniature ship that retains intricate details visible in the original full-scale ship. Features like masts, rigging, and the hull's design are preserved, demonstrating miniature craftsmanship that replicates the original structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",
    "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the surface of the blue resin layer exhibits characteristics typical of simulated water effects, such as surface textures and reflections that mimic the dynamic nature of ocean waves.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the curved glass dome visibly present with clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a glass dome with distinct boundaries encompassing the miniature scene. Though subtle, effects of light refraction can be anticipated in curved glass surfaces, further confirming the presence of a dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
