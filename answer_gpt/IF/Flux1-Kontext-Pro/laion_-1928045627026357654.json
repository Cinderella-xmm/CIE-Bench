      "question": "Does the male character's tee have a plush 3D appearance with a bold geometric pattern and an enlarged collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character's tee is rendered in a distinct style, appearing somewhat three-dimensional with geometric patterns that are bold and noticeable. However, the collar does not appear enlarged in comparison to typical tee designs. The conclusion is made by observing the detailed patterns and the structural form of the collar, which seems typical in size.",

      "question": "Are the male character's pants rendered in a plush 3D style with a bold geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character's pants are shown in a realistic texture and structure, but they lack a 3D plush style or bold geometric patterns. Instead, the pants appear smooth without additional enhancements or designs, reflecting standard fabric as commonly seen in real-world pants.",

      "question": "Do the female character's high-waisted pants feature exaggerated, prominent pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female character's pants do exhibit pleats but they are not exaggerated or overly prominent. The pleats are standard for high-waisted pants, adding to the regular aesthetic. This is determined by analyzing the silhouette of the pants where pleats contribute subtly to the style rather than dominating it.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sleeve of the female character's top visibly enlarged compared to normal proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves of the female character's top appear to be normal in size and in harmony with the overall design, without noticeable enlargement. This observation is made by comparing the relative dimensions of the sleeves to the body, maintaining typical proportions seen in clothing.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both characters rendered as chibi-style figurines with large heads, small bodies, and cartoonish proportions, dancing on a pastel-colored stage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters appear to be rendered in a chibi-style with exaggerated features like larger heads relative to their bodies and cartoonish proportions. Additionally, their placement on a pastel-colored stage suggests a playful, imaginary setting often associated with chibi figures. This conclusion uses the visual cues of exaggerated proportions and contextual setting to identify the style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the characters exhibit graceful dance poses, joyful expressions, and are placed on a pastel-colored stage, conveying playful elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are posed in dance-like positions, and the pastel-colored circular stage suggests an elegant and playful scene. While their expressions are not visible due to the blurred face, the poses themselves suggest movement and cheerfulness. The pastel backdrop enhances this notion of playful elegance, using aesthetic and contextual understanding of stage settings.",
