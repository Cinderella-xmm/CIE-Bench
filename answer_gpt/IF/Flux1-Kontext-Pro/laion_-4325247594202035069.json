      "question": "Are the four figures transformed into fish-shaped forms with visible fins and tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are four plush toys that resemble fish, each with distinct fins and tails. The appearance, colors, and shapes confirm the transformation into fish forms. Using world knowledge, it is common for plush toys to feature exaggerated and identifiable shapes to represent different animals. Based on just Image B, the transformation is clear.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the figures appear to be made of soft fabric instead of rigid plastic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows figures that are made from a soft, plush material. They have a tactile fluffy appearance typical of fabric toys. This contrasts with rigid figures that would display sharper edges and uniform surfaces typical of hard materials like plastic. The softness and plush appearance in Image B confirm the transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the figures covered in vibrant patterns using blue, green, red, and yellow colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish-shaped plush toys each have bright, vibrant colors and patterns. They include blue, green, red, and yellow, making them visually striking. The use of these bright colors and patterns indicates an emphasis on engaging, playful designs typically found in toys. Therefore, the bright colors and varied patterns are evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fins and tails of the fish figures exaggerated in size and shape compared to the original warrior limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fins and tails of the fish toys depicted in Image B are notably large and stylized, a common trait for plush toys meant to be visually distinct. Comparing these features to the limbs of an action figure, which are typically detailed yet proportional for realism, the fins and tails are exaggerated to enhance the toy’s playful characteristics, showing a clear difference.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the plush figures arranged on a sandy-textured fabric surface that resembles an underwater scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush figures are positioned on a light brown textured fabric that has a texture reminiscent of sand. The setup evokes underwater imagery or natural settings — a common staging choice for aquatic-themed toys to encourage imaginative play. This texture and hue suggest an intentional scene resembling an underwater environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the fish-shaped plush toys retain the dynamic, action-oriented poses of the original warrior figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents plush toys in a resting position that naturally suits their design as fish forms. This is in contrast to the action-ready poses of warrior figures which typically include dynamic stances and weapon-wielding gestures to imply motion and activity. Fish plush toys, being soft and round, inherently lack the capacity to maintain such complex poses.",
