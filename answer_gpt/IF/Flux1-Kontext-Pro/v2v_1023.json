      "question": "Are the friends depicted as playful, chibi-style 3D characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the friends are inside a snow globe but still appear as regular-sized, realistic human figures rather than exaggerated chibi-style 3D characters. The term 'chibi-style' refers to a drawing style where characters are made with childlike proportions, including larger heads and smaller bodies. This characteristic is not evident in the image. Therefore, they are not depicted as chibi-style 3D characters.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite being inside a snow globe, the friends' hands are clearly visible holding game controllers. The visibility of the controllers in their hands indicates that the characters are engaged in playing a video game within the snow globe.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the surface of the snow globe does display sparkle-like reflections, these are not indicative of sunlight streaming through, but rather likely stem from the internal fairy lights. There is no strong visual cue of sunlight streaming through the glass to create dancing sparkles across the tabletop.",
