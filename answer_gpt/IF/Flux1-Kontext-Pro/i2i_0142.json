      "question": "Is there a top view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, which contains four sub-images of the baseball glove, the top left and bottom left sub-images show the glove open without the baseball, which can be considered as a top view. This is concluded by observing how the glove is positioned wide open and perpendicular to the viewer's perspective.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a side view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the top right and bottom right sub-images show the glove at an angle with the baseball inside, but these are not truly side views, as they are slightly inclined and still showing the interior of the glove. They do not exemplify a true side profile where only the side of the glove and baseball would be visible.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a sectional view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A sectional view, in this context, would imply showing the inside structure or a cutaway portion of the glove and ball. In the edited image, none of the sub-images illustrate a sectional view; they merely show the glove from different angles with the ball positioned inside or absent.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the views of the baseball and glove clear and detailed enough for product catalogs or sports equipment manuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image showcases various angles of the glove and ball, with well-defined colors, details, and textures in each sub-image, making them suitable for inclusion in product catalogs or manuals where multiple perspectives are important for understanding the item.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors and textures of the baseball and glove accurately preserved in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All sub-images in the edited image consistently display the baseball and glove with accurate colors and textures. Each depiction maintains the natural brown color of the glove and the cream-white with red seams of the baseball, ensuring uniformity across all different views.",
