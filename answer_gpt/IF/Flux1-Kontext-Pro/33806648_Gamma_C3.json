      "question": "Does the edited image depict the rock arch as a recognizable stone guardian creature with anthropomorphic or guardian-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arch is not depicted as a stone guardian creature with anthropomorphic or guardian-like features. Instead, it appears as an elaborately constructed arch composed of rocks, with no elements suggesting a creature-like or anthropomorphic representation. The arch is adorned with crystalline structures and runic symbols, but lacks any features that would characterize it as a guardian creature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible crystalline structures growing along the curved edges of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are distinct crystalline structures that are visible growing along the curved edges of the arch. These crystals protrude from the stone, giving the arch a mystical appearance. The presence and arrangement of these crystals are clear and add a fantastical element to the image, consistent with depictions found in fantasy art.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vein-like lines running across the surface of the arch that follow naturalistic branching patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of having luminous, vein-like lines, the surface of the arch is marked with engraved runic symbols. These symbols are glowing but do not form naturalistic branching patterns as veins would. Therefore, the description of naturalistic branching vein-like lines does not match the visual elements observed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original arch outline been replaced with skeletal, wing-like protrusions extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature skeletal, wing-like protrusions. The arch maintains its structure with added remarkable details such as crystals and runes, but there are no extensions resembling wings or anything skeletal in form attached to its outline. This structural integrity suggests that its primary elements are decorative rather than anatomical or wing-like.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there clearly visible runic symbols engraved or etched onto the inner surface of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are clearly visible runic symbols engraved along the arch. These symbols are prominently spread across the stone surface, adding a mystical and ancient vibe to the structure. The clarity and style of these runes are typical of fantasy iconography, supporting the notion of symbolic or magical significance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a glowing orb positioned centrally within the arch, acting as a source of radiance and energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bright, glowing orb centrally positioned within the arch, emitting light and energy. This orb acts as a focal point in the image, enhancing its mystical atmosphere, and it is consistent with fantastical themes where such elements are sources of magical power or energy.",
