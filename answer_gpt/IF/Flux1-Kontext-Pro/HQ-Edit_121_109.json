      "question": "Has the hummingbird been transformed into a non-biological, ethereal entity resembling a garden spirit rather than a realistic bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird shows features that are not typically associated with a biological bird. Elements like the glass-like iridescent wings and the vine-like tail contribute to an otherworldly, ethereal appearance, aligning more with a garden spirit than a real bird. The transformation imbues the bird with a mystical quality, beyond the confines of biological realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings of the hummingbird appear as iridescent, glass-like structures that display a full rainbow spectrum of shimmering colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are depicted as iridescent, exhibiting a shimmering, glass-like appearance with multiple colors reminiscent of a rainbow. This creates an effect suggesting structural iridescence, a characteristic more typical of glass or ethereal materials rather than biological tissue.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the body feathers of the hummingbird replaced with glowing, petal-like structures that emit light or have a luminous appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body feathers of the hummingbird still appear to be closely aligned with a realistic depiction, rather than being replaced by luminous, petal-like structures. The feathers have a shiny, colorful appearance, but they do not exhibit an outwardly luminescent or petal-like form.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the beak been replaced with a transparent, crystalline spout from which a golden or honey-colored liquid (floral nectar) is visibly flowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak of the hummingbird in Image B appears as a standard hummingbird beak, without any transparent crystalline modifications or visible flow of nectar. It maintains a naturalistic form rather than being altered into a spout-like structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the hummingbird is depicted as consisting of vine-like extensions with a decorative style. These vine-like structures suggest a blending with the garden environment as they feature curling ends and a theme consistent with plants, giving an impression of integration with surrounding nature.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed hummingbird in Image B features elements like iridescent wings and vine-like tails that echo and integrate with the surrounding floral environment. The harmony of colors and textures between the bird and the flowers in the garden suggests a seamless visual integration, creating a cohesive, enchanting scene.",
