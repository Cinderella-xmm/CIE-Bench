    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sailboat rendered entirely as a carved walnut wood sculpture, with no metallic, fabric, or realistic marine materials visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sailboat clearly appears to be made from a material resembling walnut wood. The sails, hull, and other components of the boat feature a consistent wooden texture, with no visible elements of metal, fabric, or other marine materials that would typically be seen on a real sailboat. The lack of metallic or fabric textures suggests that the object is crafted entirely from a wood-like material, likely walnut, given the detailed grain patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails made of smooth, polished walnut wood featuring visible and intricate grain patterns, rather than fabric or translucent material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B exhibit smooth surfaces and display intricate grain patterns that are characteristic of polished wood, such as walnut. Unlike fabric sails, which would typically have visible folds or be somewhat translucent, these sails give solid, non-translucent, detailed appearances that indicate fine woodwork. The texture and sheen are more indicative of polished wood than fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hull of the sculpture feature deep, textured carvings that clearly mimic the appearance of wooden planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the sailboat in Image B showcases detailed carvings that mimic the texture of wooden planks. These carvings add depth and texture, simulating the look of planks one would expect in a wooden structure, thereby creating the appearance of a realistic, albeit artistic, wooden boat hull.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that elevates it above the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sailboat sculpture is positioned on a pale beige pedestal. This pedestal is clearly seen beneath the boat, providing elevation. There is no water visible in the edited image; instead, the focus is on the sculpture elevated in an indoor setting, suggesting a display piece context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the natural wood tones and detailed craftsmanship of the walnut sculpture clearly stand out against the background, without being obscured by similar colors or excessive brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The natural tones of the walnut wood sculpture, coupled with the detailed grain patterns, are clearly visible against the simple, neutral background in Image B. This contrast ensures that the sculpture's features stand out, without any competing colors or excessive brightness that might obscure its details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water consistent with the wooden sculpture, showing the carved hull and walnut sails, rather than a realistic boat reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no water present, as it depicts a model sculpture on a pedestal rather than a scene in a natural setting with water. Consequently, there is no reflection of the boat in water to compare, reinforcing instead the artistic and crafted nature of the boat as a display item.",
