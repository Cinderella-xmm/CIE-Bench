      "question": "Does the elephant appear as a 3D chibi-style desktop figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a 3D figurine or model of an elephant placed on a round base. The elephant's proportions, with a slightly exaggerated head and shorter limbs, are consistent with chibi-style designs, characterized by cute, compact proportions. This style is commonly used in creating collectible figurines or models. The visual cues, such as the scale and design, suggest a desktop-sized model rather than a lifelike representation.",

      "question": "Is the elephant still depicted in its original grass-eating pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B retains the pose observed in Image A, where it is depicted with grass in its trunk as if it is feeding. Despite being transformed into a figurine, the essence of the original pose is preserved, where the trunk is curled around the grass, indicating the same activity.",

      "question": "Does the base mimic muddy terrain with \"Jungle Friend\" engraved around the edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base appears to reflect a textured surface suggesting muddy terrain, a detail both visually and contextually tied to a jungle habitat. The words 'Jungle Friend' are clearly engraved or embossed around the base's edge, providing thematic context to the figurine placement. This design choice is intended to enhance the figurine's jungle theme.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the materials used matte polymer clay for the figurine and a transparent acrylic dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant figurine exhibits a matte finish typical of polymer clay models, characterized by a lack of gloss or shine. There are no visual cues suggesting a transparent acrylic dome covering the figurine, as it is photographed openly on a plain background. Such domes are often included in collectible display products to protect and showcase the figurine, but Image B lacks this element.",

      "question": "Is the overall style consistent with product photography composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a clean background with focused lighting and a centered composition, common attributes in product photography designed to highlight the subject. The presentation aims to emphasize the details and design elements of the figurine and base, creating an impression of a promotional or commercial image. Product photography often has a minimalist approach to draw attention to the item being advertised, which is evident here.",
