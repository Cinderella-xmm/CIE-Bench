      "question": "Has a butterfly been added above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable presence of a butterfly positioned prominently above the round mirror. This was not a part of the original design of the bathroom or the mirror's reflection. The butterfly appears distinct and is clearly an addition to this setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butterfly golden in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B has orange and black patterning on its wings, a common characteristic of a Monarch butterfly. While its color is vibrant, it is more accurate to describe it as orange rather than golden. 'Golden' would imply a metallic or shimmering yellow hue, which is not present here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly placed above rather than beside or below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is situated at the top center of the mirror, clearly above it. This positioning is vertically higher than the rest of the elements in the image, indicating that it is specifically located above the mirror.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the butterfly blend naturally with the lighting around the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is situated in front of the illuminated ring around the mirror. However, the butterfly does not appear to be integrated into the lighting scheme seamlessly. The reflection and shading on the butterfly do not fully correspond with the mirror's backlighting, which suggests a lack of natural blending.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the butterfly maintain harmony with the overall environment of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly, with its vibrant orange and black coloration, contrasts against the neutral, modern tones of the bathroom in Image B. While it adds a colorful element to the setting, the colors and style deviate from the minimalistic and muted design, which makes it seem somewhat out of place. Thus, it does not fully maintain harmony with the environment.",
