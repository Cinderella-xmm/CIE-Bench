      "question": "Does the character display exaggerated chibi proportions with a larger head and smaller body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is designed as a small keychain figure. Chibi style is characterized by exaggerated proportions, specifically a larger head in contrast to a smaller body. In the image, the character exhibits these typical chibi features, with a head that is proportionally larger compared to the body, which aligns with the chibi design aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the character standing on a shell-shaped base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character as a figure with a round base, which is common for supporting such figurines. There is no visual indicator of the base being shell-shaped. Instead, it appears to be a simple, flat circle designed for stability, which is typical for keychain or small merchandise figures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi version retain the character's straw hat, red jacket, and cheerful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the blurred face, the character is wearing a straw hat and a red jacket similar to those in Image A. While we cannot definitively confirm the expression due to blurring, from the stylized elements visible, it's inferred that the chibi version maintains the cheerful look, as typical chibi characters are often depicted with happy expressions. Additionally, retaining signature clothing items is common in character adaptations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the characterâ€™s features (like buttons on the jacket and belt) simplified but still recognizable in the chibi design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows simplified but identifiable features of the character. The red jacket includes buttons that, while less detailed than in Image A, are recognizable. The yellow belt is also present and simplified, consistent with the chibi design's approach to maintaining essential features while reducing detail for cuteness and abstraction.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base clearly visible under the character's feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the character standing on a base that is clearly circular and not shell-shaped. The base appears more functional than decorative, serving as a stable platform for the chibi figure. There is no indication or visual cue suggesting that the base is shell-shaped.",
