      "question": "Is the image formatted as an educational infographic with structured layout elements such as titles, labels, and text boxes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a structured layout is evident due to visual elements such as the prominent title at the top, labels pointing to different parts of the butterfly, and text boxes containing information related to butterfly biology. These are typical features of an educational infographic designed to convey scientific information in a visually organized manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features the title 'Butterfly Biology Basics' at the top of the image. This positioning is typical in infographics to immediately communicate the subject of the material, ensuring that viewers can quickly understand the focus of the educational content.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax) labeled with monochrome line-drawing overlays on the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, labels such as 'Antermennas', 'Boaelentics', and 'Anatemea' can be seen pointing to different parts of the butterfly. However, the labels use nonsensical terms that resemble anatomical labels instead of accurate descriptions like antennae or thorax. Despite the erroneous labels, some parts of the butterfly are connected with lines from labeled descriptions, fulfilling the structural intent of overlaying labels.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows pink flower petals alongside a label 'Phoraet,' hinting at the butterfly's feeding habits. Given the context, it suggests the butterfly might prefer such flowers, despite nonsensical text in the explanation. These petals play a part in illustrating potential ecological interactions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a label titled 'Pollination' placed next to a flower drawing. While the explanation text contains gibberish, it visually implies that the butterfly is involved in pollination activities. The layout element mimics a standard educational format of providing informative annotations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a delicate visual style, emphasizing the butterfly's vibrant blue color, which serves as the central focal point. Despite additional text and label overlays, the butterfly retains its original color and visual prominence, capturing the viewers' attention as intended in both educational and aesthetic contexts.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the original blue butterfly clearly and intact, maintaining its vibrant color and detail as seen in Image A. The edited image's additions do not obscure or significantly alter the appearance of the butterfly, preserving its striking qualities for informational purposes.",
