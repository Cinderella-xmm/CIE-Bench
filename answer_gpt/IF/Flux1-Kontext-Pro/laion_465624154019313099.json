      "question": "Is the edited image a two-panel comic strip with the title “Cake Conundrum!” displayed at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is an edited comic strip consisting of four panels, not two. The title 'Cake Conbingrum!' is at the top. The word 'Conbingrum' is a misspelling or playful alteration of 'Conundrum', but the comic is not in two panels.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cake creature has been illustrated with expressive eyes and a mouth on its surface, with a strawberry positioned on top, resembling a hat. This gives the cake a character-like appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The first panel of Image B shows a cake creature with its eyes wide open in an expression of surprise. The speech bubble above it reads, 'Who ate my delicious corner?', indicating surprise and concern about the missing piece of the cake.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, there are silhouettes of people, but none of utensils like spoons or forks. The background creates a sense of a crowd or audience, but not specifically a party setting with utensils.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B does show strawberries arranging as bodyguards around the cake creature. The creature appears assertive, not shaking its head, but the dialogue 'No more free bits, time for dessert defense!' indicates a defensive stance. It's a thematic illustration where the cake character is protecting itself.",
