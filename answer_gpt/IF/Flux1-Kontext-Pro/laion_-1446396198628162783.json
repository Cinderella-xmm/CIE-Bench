    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the title \"Journey to Space\" clearly displayed in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a prominent title located at the top in large, white letters that clearly reads 'Journey to Space'. The placement and font size make it easily noticeable. This is indicative of the title being prominently displayed, thus answering the question.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the astronaut figure still present and positioned centrally in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The astronaut figure is still the central focus of the edited image, maintaining a similar position to what is typically seen in such informative layouts. By comparing with standard compositions, where the main subject is often centrally positioned to draw the viewer's attention, it's clear this convention has been adhered to.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the background been transformed into a mission control center with elements like control panels, screens, or consoles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background resembles a space-themed design rather than a mission control center. It does not show elements like control panels, screens, or consoles. Instead, it has illustrative and educational content, such as textual information and icons related to space training. This indicates that the background does not mimic a mission control center.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there four distinct illustrative icons present, each representing one of the following: Physical Training, Technical Skills, Simulators, and Space Suit Check?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image contains four distinct icons, each placed in a section with a heading. These sections are labeled as 'Physical Training', 'Technical Training', 'Simulators', and 'Space Suit Check'. This suggests that the image has deliberately included icons to represent these different training aspects related to space preparation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the four training stages represented in distinct, vibrant color-coded sections (e.g., different colored backgrounds or labels)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sections in the edited image use different colors for each label, creating a vibrant and distinct separation for each of the training stages: blue, orange, green, and red. Such color-coding helps in differentiating sections visually, which is a common design strategy for clarity and aesthetic appeal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text describing each training stage written in clean, modern typography (e.g., sans-serif font, consistent style)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the edited image uses a sans-serif font, which is typically associated with modern, clean typography. The consistencies in font style across different sections further suggest a modern and unified typographical approach, enhancing readability and aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall design appear cohesive and informative, with a logical flow connecting the astronaut to the training stages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in the edited image appears to effectively engage viewers by connecting the central astronaut figure with the surrounding information on training. The logical arrangement of icons and text in relation to the astronaut suggests an informative design layout aimed at clearly conveying the training process to the audience.",
