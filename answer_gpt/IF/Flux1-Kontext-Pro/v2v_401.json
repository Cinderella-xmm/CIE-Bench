        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background appears to have a texture similar to old paper, with uneven edges and a brown color, which is commonly associated with weathered parchment. This is different from the more smooth, wooden surface from the original image. The visual cues from the edited image suggest a deliberate transformation to evoke a map-like feel.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edited image, a dotted trail is visible, winding through the landmarks and concluding at a large 'X' on the map. The 'X' is designed to resemble a frosting swirl, which ties into the pastry theme. This visual arrangement mimics the common design of treasure maps where paths connect points of interest to a destination marker.",
