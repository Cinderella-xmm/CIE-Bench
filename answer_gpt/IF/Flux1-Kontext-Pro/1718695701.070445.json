      "question": "Is the capybara's body rendered as a polished bronze metallic surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible part of the capybara's body appears to have a metallic sheen consistent with polished bronze. The color and texture are characteristic of bronze material, giving it a shiny, reflective appearance typical of polished metals.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the blue knitted hat been replaced with an intricately detailed bronze helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The portion of the image visible in Image B shows what seems to be a bronze surface in place of a knitted texture, suggesting that a bronze helmet has replaced the original hat. The texture visible in the bronze matches that of a helmet structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sunglasses now composed of glass lenses set in bronze frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the regions visible in Image B, the sunglasses are not present. Instead, the areas around the visor of the helmet suggest a single material continuity as bronze with no distinction in color or texture to indicate the presence of glass lenses or different materials.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible bronze regions in Image B do have some textural elements that could represent engraved lines, suggesting an effort to retain the finer details of a fur pattern, but it is not distinctly evident due to the metallic styling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the sculpture visible in Image B appears to be made of a pale material with subtle textural lines that are characteristic of marble. The base appears plain and understated, supporting the bust without drawing attention away from it.",
