      "question": "Is there a 3D chibi-style figure emerging from the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a chibi-style figure seated inside a yellow kayak. The figure is visually rendered using 3D graphics, characterized by exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art style. The figure's design and positioning give the impression that it is integrated within the kayak and not emerging from it. Such visual depiction aligns with the creation of digital or animated environments. Therefore, the figure appears seated, not emerging.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure appear to be crossing the kayakâ€™s edge and stepping into the real-world environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure in Image B is seated within the confines of the kayak without any visible action of crossing or stepping over its edge into an outside environment. The image represents a scene captured within a Polaroid photograph, which confines the figure to its illustrated environment on the water, and no visual cues suggest any interaction with the external real-world environment.",

      "question": "Is the scene framed within a Polaroid photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene featuring the chibi-style figure in a kayak on a water body is encapsulated within a bordered frame typical of Polaroid photographs. The white border surrounding the image mimics the characteristics of instant film pictures. This framing isolates the internal image from the hand holding it, enhancing the appearance of a photo-in-hand. This setup is consistent with Polaroid photos.",

      "question": "Is the Polaroid photograph being held by a human hand in the overall composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows human hands supporting the Polaroid photograph containing the chibi-style kayaking scene. This aspect indicates human interaction, as the fingers are visibly gripping the sides of the photo, portraying it as if the person is viewing or demonstrating the captured scene. The presence of hands gives a context of someone holding and emphasizing the Polaroid framing.",

      "question": "Are the original kayak and skateboard still present and recognizable in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only depicts a scene captured within a Polaroid photograph featuring a chibi-style figure and a kayak. The skateboard is absent, and the kayak is part of the illustration within the Polaroid photograph. Without reference to Image A, the edited composition does not visually present the actual, separate kayak or skateboard originally depicted. The figures are illustration-based rather than representing the tangible objects from Image A.",
