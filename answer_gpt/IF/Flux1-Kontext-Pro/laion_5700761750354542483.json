      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the butterfly now made of soft fabric instead of metallic or gemstone materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly still appears to be made of metallic material, with gemstone-like decorative elements that glitter and shine, indicating a hard surface. The visual cues of light reflection and the detailed faceting of the components support the conclusion that it's not made of fabric. Therefore, the butterfly is not made of soft fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements on the butterflyâ€™s wings replaced with embroidered patterns in vibrant blue and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the butterfly with numerous round gems and intricate detailing that resemble gemstones rather than embroidery. Blue and gold colors are present, but they exhibit characteristics of gem materials with their shine and light reflection. This suggests the decorative elements are not embroidered patterns but retaining the gemstone appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wings of the butterfly appear to be made of a velvety material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B have a shiny, reflective surface typical of gemstones or metal rather than a soft, non-reflective texture like velvet. Such materials generally have a distinct shine, unlike the matte finish typical of velvety materials. Hence, the wings do not appear velvety.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there fluffy or fuzzy textures visible along the edges of the butterfly's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination, Image B shows a slight fuzzy texture at the extreme edges of the butterfly's wings, which might suggest a faint fluffiness not characteristic of metal or gem materials. This suggests there is a presence of fluffy or fuzzy textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {

      "question": "Does the butterfly retain its original shape and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with the original characteristics known from common visuals of butterfly shapes, the butterfly seems to maintain a consistent shape and proportion that aligns with typical butterfly designs, with symmetrical wings and body structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the butterfly positioned atop a plain pearl-white cushion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is distinctly positioned on a surface that appears to be pearl-white, possibly resembling a cushion due to its simple, evenly colored background and soft-looking texture. This suggests the presence of a plain pearl-white cushion.",
