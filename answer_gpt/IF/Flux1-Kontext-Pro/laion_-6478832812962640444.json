      "question": "Is the boot transformed into a sculpture-like object with a rigid, stylized structure consistent with Art Deco aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a boot with elaborate and stylized designs that could be described as sculpture-like. The patterns are intricate and have a certain rigidity to them which aligns with some Art Deco aesthetics characterized by symmetry, geometric shapes, and stylized forms. Therefore, it appears to adopt certain traits of Art Deco, but it does still retain its fundamental structure as a boot.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embroidered floral patterns replaced with geometric designs such as zigzags, chevrons, or sunburst motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot is adorned with geometric patterns. These patterns have angular and zigzag-like shapes that could be interpreted as falling into geometric categories like zigzags or chevrons, rather than floral. This design lacks the flowery, organic quality typical of floral patterns, suggesting a replacement with more structured, geometric designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative elements on the boot have a metallic sheen and appear as inlaid metal plates or strips rather than stitched leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative elements on Image B's boot exhibit a visible metallic sheen, suggesting they resemble inlaid metal plates rather than the textured look of stitched leather. This perception is bolstered by the reflective quality seen in parts of the decoration, which usually isn't characteristic of traditional leather stitching.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the heel been redesigned into a stepped, multi-tiered architectural shape with sharp angles and vertical emphasis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heel in Image B does not display a stepped or multi-tiered architectural shape. It maintains the traditional boot heel form, without any sharp angles or vertical designs that would suggest an architectural transformation. The heel remains uniform and consistent with typical boot design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot surface exhibit a hard, reflective, non-leather-like finish consistent with metal or polished stone, indicating a sculptural material change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the boot in image B has a reflective quality that is atypical of traditional leather, suggesting a finish more akin to metal or polished stone. This shiny appearance contributes to a perception of the boot having a harder, more sculptural material characteristic, consistent with a possible material change.",
