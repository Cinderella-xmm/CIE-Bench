      "question": "Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of four distinct frames showing different stages of a tennis swing. These frames represent a sequence of actions that can logically be inferred as the stages of preparing, swinging, hitting, and following through. This deduction is based on the positions and movements common to tennis and depicted sequentially in each frame.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the illustration drawn in clean line art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B is composed of clear outlines and limited shading or detail, typical of a clean line art style, which focuses on the shape and form using lines without intricate details or color blending.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the illustration use monochrome color fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is mainly shown in grayscale and black lines, with no color variety or shading complexity, confirming the use of a monochrome color scheme where the focus is on line work rather than color differences.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Has the background been completely removed from the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no elements or details present in the background; the focus is solely on the subjects in the frames, which suggests that the background has been completely removed to emphasize the subject.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B arranges the four frames vertically rather than horizontally, which means they are not laid out in a conventional horizontal strip typically used for instructional purposes.",
