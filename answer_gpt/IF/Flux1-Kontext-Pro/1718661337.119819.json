      "question": "Is the officer wearing a brown leather trench coat instead of the original naval uniform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the officer is depicted wearing a brown leather trench coat. This is evident from the material and color of the coat, which is distinctly different from the original blue and gold naval uniform seen in Image A. The trench coat aligns with a more rugged and industrial aesthetic, common in steampunk styling, which contrasts with the formal and structured appearance of a naval uniform.",

      "question": "Are brass gears and mechanical components visibly attached to the officer's clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible brass gears and mechanical components attached to the officer's clothing. These are typically found in steampunk designs, which incorporate industrial elements and mechanical parts as part of fashion. These elements are absent in Image A, where the focus is on a classical naval uniform style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the object in the officer's right hand a chronometer-like gadget instead of a bell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in the officer's right hand resembles a chronometer or a time-related gadget. It is round and features a dial, which aligns with common designs for timekeeping devices. In contrast, Image A shows a bell in the officer's hand, a traditional nautical tool.",

      "question": "Does the background depict a sky with airships and floating cities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sky filled with airships, indicative of an imaginative or alternative reality, often associated with steampunk or fantasy aesthetics. This contrasts with Image A, where the background consists of a more conventional seaside landscape with no airships or floating cities.",

      "question": "Are goggles visible on the tricorne hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, goggles are prominently visible on top of the tricorne hat, which are thematic to the steampunk genre, juxtaposing technology and Victorian fashion. This accessory is absent in Image A, where the hat follows a traditional naval style without modifications.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the officerâ€™s posture and facial expression remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The officer's posture in Image B is similar to that in Image A, holding an item in his right hand. However, since the face is not visible, the assessment of facial expression cannot be accurately made. Based on available visible features, the overall posture remains essentially unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall visual style of the image reflect Victorian-era steampunk aesthetics, including brass elements and mechanical design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly reflects Victorian-era steampunk aesthetics through the use of a leather trench coat with brass buttons and gears, goggles, and airships in the background. These elements collectively signify a departure from historical accuracy towards an alternate technological universe typical of steampunk design, which is drastically different in style from Image A's historical naval theme.",
