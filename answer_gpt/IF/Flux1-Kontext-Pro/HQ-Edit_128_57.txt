    "Question": "Q3: Has the open book been replaced with a writing pad made of antique-style paper?",
    "explanation": "In both images, there is an open book featured prominently. In Image B, the open book remains, showing detailed writing on antique-style paper. Since the question suggests the change to a 'writing pad,' the existing object does not match the description of a pad replacement.",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a small ink bottle placed on top of the desk or packaging?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a small ink bottle is present on top of the ornate desk or box, positioned next to the quill. This setup is distinct from Image A, where no ink bottle is visible on the desk.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are brand details visibly etched along the spine of the writing pad?",
