      "question": "Has the painting on the wall been removed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the item on the wall appears to be similar in nature to a painting, given its artistic representation of clouds, sea, and sky. It suggests the presence of artwork rather than no item at all. Thus, the painting has not been removed but has been changed in its artistic theme.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has a digital display screen been added in place of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the item on the wall has a framed appearance, depicting realistic clouds and sea, which might suggest a digital display screen showing detailed imagery, rather than a traditional painting. A comparison with Image A confirms a change in imagery style from an artistic sunset scene to more realistic weather depiction, suggesting a digital medium.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The imagery in Image B is highly realistic, depicting clouds, sky, and ocean with detailed precision that is typical of digital displays showing real-time weather imagery. This contrasts with the artistic painting style of Image A, reinforcing the conclusion that Image B likely displays real-time information.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital display in Image B occupies the same position on the wall as the painting in Image A. Both images show the wall feature above two chairs, indicating that the location of the wall fixture remains unchanged in terms of positioning within the room.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B maintain similar chair positioning and symmetry around the central wall object, whether it be a painting or a digital display. The room's composition appears unchanged, suggesting that replacing the painting with the display screen has not affected the overall balance.",
