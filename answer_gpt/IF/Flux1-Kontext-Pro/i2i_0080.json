      "question": "Does the image include a depiction of the dog from its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted from two different perspectives: one from the left side and the other from the back. The left-side view shows the dog's full body, including its head, paws, and tail, oriented to the left. This conclusion is drawn from the visible orientation of the dog's face and posture, consistent with a left-side view representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog illustrated from its back view within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents two perspectives: left side and back view. The back view is characterized by the dog's rear, including its back, tail, and lack of frontal facial features, suggesting an orientation directly facing away from the viewer. This understanding results from the dog's posture and the absence of front-facing features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the left side and back views of the dog combined into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the left side and back views of the dog are presented adjacent to each other within a single image frame. This composition allows for a simultaneous comparison of the two angles within one visual context, as indicated by the layout where both views are visibly present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dog shown on the bed in both the left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog is depicted on a bed in both the left side and back views within Image B. The visual elements, such as the consistent positioning of the dog on the bed in both perspectives, confirm this. The presence of the bed structure and consistent contact of the dog with it in both views indicate that the dog is on the bed in each depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bed and bedsheet appear consistently in both views of the dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed and bedsheet are presented similarly in both the left side and back views of the dog. The wooden bed frame and green bedsheet appear consistent in color, texture, and shape in both views, confirming a uniform representation across the two perspectives.",
