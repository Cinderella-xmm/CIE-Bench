    "Question": "Q1: Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spheres and cubes are still present and have not been replaced by LEGO bricks. They retain the original marbled patterns as seen with smooth spherical shapes and scattered cubes. Therefore, the appearance is consistent with spheres and cubes rather than LEGO brick shapes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects do not exhibit a matte surface texture; instead, the spheres appear glossy with reflective highlights. Since the surface is shiny, it contradicts the characteristic of a matte texture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spheres and cubes are scattered in a somewhat chaotic manner, lacking an orderly or structured arrangement characteristic of LEGO bricks. They are indeed placed on a wooden shelf, but their arrangement does not follow a systematic or structured pattern.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the LEGO bricks display subtle interlocking details such as studs or recessed connectors?",
    "explanation": "The objects in Image B, consisting of spheres and cubes, do not exhibit any interlocking details characteristic of LEGO bricks such as studs or recessed connectors. Their surfaces are smooth, maintaining the original marbled design.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background simplified into a clean, uniform, and uncluttered minimalist style?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a wooden shelf that contrasts with the smooth background seen in Image A, which is more uniform and minimalist. Since Image B includes this wooden shelf, it is less simplified and uncluttered, breaking the minimalist style.",
