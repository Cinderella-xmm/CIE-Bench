    "Question": "Q1: Is there a diagram composed of annotated lines and minimalist icons surrounding the tea set, illustrating the four steps of 'The Journey of Tea'?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a header titled 'The Journey of Tea' which suggests a thematic or educational representation regarding tea. However, the visible annotations and lines around the tea set only allude to certain aspects (e.g., 'Tea leaves harvested', 'Soup for boiling water', and 'Blossoms symbolize tranquility'). There is no presence of a diagram specifically illustrating four steps, as there are not four distinct stages or processes depicted around the tea set. Thus, the description doesn't match a diagram systematically illustrating four steps.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there four distinct minimalist icons visible in the image, each corresponding to one of the following: tea leaves harvested, boiling water poured, sipping for mindfulness, and blossoms symbolizing tranquility?",
    "explanation": "While Image B has some annotations and visuals representing elements like 'Tea leaves harvested' and 'Blossoms symbolize tranquility,' there aren't four distinct minimalist icons clearly corresponding to all the specified categories. The image does not show minimalist icons for boiling water poured or sipping for mindfulness. The visible annotations refer more to pictographic or textual elements than distinct icons.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the labels or captions accompanying the diagram written in a handwritten calligraphy style?",
    "explanation": "The text accompanying the illustrations in Image B appears to be written in a font that mimics a handwritten style, giving it a more personalized and artistic feel, akin to calligraphy or a handwriting look. This aligns with the use of visually soft, flowing script characteristic of handwritten calligraphy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are soft pastel green hues present in the diagram elements (e.g., lines, icons, or text) to complement the overall color scheme?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements such as lines, text, and sketches associated with the tea theme have a soft pastel green tint, which blends with the earthy and soft tones of the tea set arrangement. This pastel hue complements the aesthetic and maintains a cohesive overall color scheme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all original objects—the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with cherry blossoms, and patterned mats—present and unchanged in their positions and appearances?",
    "explanation": "Upon comparison, all original objects from Image A, such as the teapot, cup, chopsticks, vase with cherry blossoms, and patterned mats, are still present in Image B. The arrangement and appearance of these items remain consistent, with only additional illustrative elements integrated into the image without altering these objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the added diagram avoid overlapping or obscuring any of the original table elements and instead flow naturally around them?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the diagram's elements, including lines and text, are strategically placed to ensure they don't overlap or obscure the primary objects on the table, such as the teapot, cup, and vase. The annotations are positioned around these objects, effectively integrating additional information without disrupting the visual integrity of the original setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"
