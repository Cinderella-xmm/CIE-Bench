      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire figure rendered with a dark wood texture resembling an ancient African sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure exhibits a dark, polished texture which resembles the surface of wood. This is commonly associated with traditional African sculptures, which often utilize dark wood and a smooth finish to achieve a lifelike quality. The lighting and shading enhance the appearance of the texture, reinforcing the impression of wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing depicted as deeply incised carved reliefs rather than fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing patterns appear to be more raised and have depth compared to the typical texture of fabric, indicating carved reliefs. This involves using techniques that create a pronounced design on a solid surface, in this case resembling carved patterns on wood.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the beaded crown and earrings rendered in vivid, painted colors on the wooden surface, standing out from the surrounding carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads in the crown and earrings are distinctly colorful against the dark wood texture, suggesting that they are painted onto the wood surface. The vivid colors contrast with the more muted tones of the wood, typical of embellishments in sculptural artforms to emphasize certain features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not appear as carved relief but rather retains a painted quality similar to a traditional illustration of a jungle scene. The details do not have the depth or contrast mainly associated with low-relief carvings.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
