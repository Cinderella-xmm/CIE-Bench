      "question": "Has the skater been replaced with a figure wearing sleek metallic armor and neon accents instead of a red hoodie and jeans?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest that the skater is wearing a futuristic suit with metallic accents and neon highlights.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the skateboard now a hoverboard with a glowing, transparent deck and no visible wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard retains visible wheels and a solid deck, albeit with neon accents. Despite glowing elements, the essential features of a skateboard, such as wheels and a solid deck, are still present, indicating that it is not a transparent hoverboard without wheels.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an environment characterized by neon lights, digital-looking structures, and artificial lighting, suggesting a shift from a real-world skate park setting with traditional graffiti in Image A to a more stylized, urban setting with digital elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graffiti elements appear to be illuminated or glowing, in stark contrast to the static and non-illuminated graffiti present in Image A. This glowing effect suggests a digital, interactive nature that is commonly associated with digital effects or animations.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display specific motion lines around the skater aimed at emphasizing speed and movement, unlike some artistic techniques that use such lines to convey motion dynamics in static imagery.",
