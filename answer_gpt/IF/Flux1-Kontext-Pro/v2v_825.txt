    "Question": "Q1: Are the calendar pages arranged into a tidy pile?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar pages are clearly stacked in a neat pile. The pages are aligned with each other and are stacked uniformly on the surface. This organization indicates that they are indeed arranged tidily.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates still present and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a 'Wedding' note written in red on January 12, which is highlighted with a blue circle, and January 6 is highlighted with a yellow circle. These indicate that the handwritten notes and highlighted dates are present. However, since the original Image A is not yet considered, we cannot confirm if they are unchanged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the calendar pages and desk surface display convincing textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden surface with a visible grain pattern typical of desk surfaces, giving it a realistic texture. The calendar pages themselves have clear and distinct outlines, giving the paper a believable thickness and texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there evidence of lighting and shadow depth creating a realistic appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft and appears to be coming from a single source, casting shadows on and around the edges of the pile of calendar pages. The shadow depth gives the pages a realistic three-dimensional appearance, enhancing the overall realism of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the colors and styles of the handwritten notes and highlighted dates been preserved?",
    "explanation": "Since only Image B is analyzed without Image A's comparison, Image B's calendar displays a red 'Wedding' note and circles in blue and yellow on specific dates. The color style of these markings appears consistent and integrated with the overall calendar layout, indicating consistency in design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
