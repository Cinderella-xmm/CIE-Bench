      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features visual elements typical of a pet adoption poster. The image includes large text that promotes adoption, a cute cat, and motivational phrases encouraging adoption. The border around the image further emphasizes its poster-like quality.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the addition of text, the cat is centrally positioned and occupies the majority of the visual space. The cat's positioning draws the viewer's attention, and the surrounding text and border further highlight the catâ€™s presence as the focal point. Therefore, the cat remains the central focus of the image.",
