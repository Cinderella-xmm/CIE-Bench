        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a figure dressed in an attire that appears to be a tailored suit with a high collar and a cravat.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a headwear consistent with a top hat, characterized by its tall, cylindrical shape that’s typical of 19th-century Western fashion.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B showcases elements typical of a 19th-century British countryside estate, including a manor house and expansive green surroundings.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
