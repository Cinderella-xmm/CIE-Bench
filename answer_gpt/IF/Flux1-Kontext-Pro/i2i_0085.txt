    "Question": "Q1: Does the painting visibly extend beyond its frame to create a 3D effect?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the painting does not show any signs of extension beyond its frame. The frame clearly separates the artwork from the wall, maintaining a traditional flat, framed appearance without any attempt at optical illusions or extensions giving a 3D effect.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the elements from the painting visually merge into the room environment, such as appearing on the wall or floor?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the painting's elements remain confined within the borders of the frame. There is no visual merging where aspects such as the trees or water from the painting appear to continue onto the flat wall or the surrounding room environment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the transitions between the painting and the room environment smooth without any abrupt edges?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, the transitions between the painting and the room environment are defined by the frame, which presents a clear boundary. There are no blended elements that would require a smooth transition, as this is a framed painting against a wall, thus creating distinct and abrupt edges at the frame.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original elements of the painting, such as trees, water, and the sun, still identifiable in the edited version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all original elements such as the trees, water, and the sun within the painting are clearly visible and retain their identifiable characteristics. The edited image does not alter these elements, and they are easily recognizable to anyone familiar with these natural features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

```json
{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows in the extended portions of the painting match those in the actual room environment?",
    "explanation": "There are no extended portions of the painting in Image B that interact with the roomâ€™s environment, so the question of lighting and shadow matching does not apply. The lighting and shadows found in the image pertain solely to the room environment, separate from the painting.",
    "answer": "No"
}
