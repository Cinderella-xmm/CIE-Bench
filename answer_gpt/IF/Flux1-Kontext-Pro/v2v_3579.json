      "question": "Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged in a manner that forms a recognizable shape of a person. The body is outlined with a combination of sushi pieces, including arms, legs, and a head, suggesting intentional design to resemble a person. The organization of sushi pieces mimics the human anatomy, enabling the visual perception of a human figure. World knowledge tells us that this arrangement, given its distinct form and pattern, strongly indicates a representation of a person.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the right arm of the sushi figure is angled upwards, away from the body, resembling a waving gesture or raised position. The sushi arrangement distinctly separates from the torso, and the arm is complete with hand-shaped pieces. World knowledge about typical arm positions in a greeting or signaling gesture supports the conclusion of an arm being lifted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the sushi person figure, there is a visible representation of a left arm attached to the torso. The arm structure is clearly delineated, extending from the body with a sequence of sushi pieces matching the arm's typical position. It is positioned alongside the body, consistent with its anatomically correct location.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the lower part of the sushi arrangement includes two distinct sections that resemble legs. They are aligned vertically and symmetrically below what represents the torso. The separation into two parts matching the lower limbs suggests a full representation of legs, clear to the observer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head of the person figure represented by sushi pieces and distinguishable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi person has a circular section at the top, distinct from the rest, resembling a head. Its placement above the shoulder area and its round shape typically represents a head in simple figures. Common understanding of simplified human representations confirms this part as the head.",
