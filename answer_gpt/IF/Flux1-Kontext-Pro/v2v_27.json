      "question": "Does the wombat in the stickers have overly large, expressive eyes and gentle facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stickers show a wombat character that has relatively small, simple eyes rather than overly large ones. The facial features are simplistic and cartoon-like, resembling gentle expressions typical in chibi art styles. World knowledge about cartoon characters, especially chibi style, supports the observation that these facial features are minimalistic rather than expressive.",

      "question": "Are all six distinct poses correctly depicted in the stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are six stickers, each portraying the wombat in different poses and expressions. This array of stickers is complete and correctly shows a variety of poses: one holding a peace sign, one waving with tears, one sitting and winking, one with a belly hold, one meditating with sparkling features, and one gesturing with eyes closed. World knowledge in character design for sticker sheets usually involves multiple variations to show diversity.",

      "question": "Is the wombat wearing a fun Hawaiian shirt and straw hat similar to those in the reference image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is consistently depicted in a Hawaiian shirt with floral patterns and a straw hat in each sticker, similar to what we can infer from the Image A description without visually comparing. The attire matches the tropical theme evident in both images; thus, the design is coherent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the stickers include bright tropical tones with hibiscus flowers, palm fronds, or fruity drink designs in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the stickers is mostly plain and does not feature elements such as hibiscus flowers, palm fronds, or fruity drinks. The focus is on the wombat, and any design elements like tropical tones are more subtle, limited to attire or poses, rather than being part of the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stickers designed with a dimension ratio of 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a grid of six stickers, arranged in a 3x2 formation. The entire arrangement appears more square than rectangular. The dimension ratio of 9:16 typically refers to a rectangular, vertical format which is not the apparent design in the image of the stickers.",
