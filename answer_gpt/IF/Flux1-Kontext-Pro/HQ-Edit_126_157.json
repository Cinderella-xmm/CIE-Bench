    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly enclosed within a wooden frame. The edges of the frame are visible around the boatman and the background, resembling the characteristics of a hand-carved wooden frame due to its smooth, polished wood texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the presentation of elements in a layered format, where the boat sits on a flat surface suggesting cutout elements, and the background appears flat as though printed separately.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boat in Image B displays detailed textures including visible cracks and grain patterns typical of aged wood. These textures suggest a realistic representation of weathered surfaces often found in vintage wooden boats.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hills appear in pastel blue shades, characterized by soft gradients, rather than realistic green or gray tones, emphasizing an artistic rendering rather than a photographic likeness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the water in Image B has delicate droplet-like markings or etchings, visible as shiny, raised points, simulating ripples through artistic depiction rather than actual water movement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat, water, and hills seem to be placed in distinct layers with a physical separation apparent between them, thus creating a sense of depth through multi-layered composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
