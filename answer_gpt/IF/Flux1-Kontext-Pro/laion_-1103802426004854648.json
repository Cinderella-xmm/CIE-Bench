      "question": "Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the seahorse has a shiny, reflective quality, indicating it is made from glass or a similar material rather than plush fabric, which is typically soft and non-reflective. Visual cues like smoothness and reflective highlights support this analysis.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse have a translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the seahorse with a glossy, translucent pink appearance suggesting it is made from glass. However, there are no noticeable bubble textures visible on the body, as the surface appears smooth and uniformly colored.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The belly section of the seahorse in Image B is yellow and appears opaque like glass. It has a music note design visible, resembling etching that you might see on glass. The reflective property and design style suggest it is made from glass material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ribbons on the head and fins in Image B appear to have a glass-like, shiny texture with lavender color, contrasting with the more matte appearance of fabric ribbons. The reflection and the structure suggest a glass material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the seahorse mounted on a black stand that reflects light, indicating it is a display stand possibly made from a material like polished wood or plastic that has a high-gloss finish.",
