      "question": "Is the image presented as a series of separate stamp-like elements arranged in a grid or collection format, each resembling a paper-cut design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a single scene rather than a series of separate elements or stamps. It has a framed look with a single figure in front of the traditional Korean architecture, rather than a grid format of multiple designs. My analysis is based on the overall structure being a continuous image without distinct separations typical of stamp collections.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral embroidery on the hanbok sleeves appears to exhibit metallic shine, suggesting the presence of foil effects. This is indicated by the reflective and shiny quality of the embroidery that stands out compared to typical fabric.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The bow size has been preserved accurately in Image B compared to Image A. The proportions of the bow in relation to the hanbok appear consistent with the original setting, indicating no significant enlargement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the traditional Korean architecture as part of the main background with a seamless integration into the overall composition. Although itâ€™s a single framed image, not part of a stamp series, the architecture is clearly visible and complements the attire of the subject.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an embossed frame that resembles leather texture with visible depth around the edges of the image. Although not a stamp series, this border detail provides a leathery appearance that encases the picture.",
