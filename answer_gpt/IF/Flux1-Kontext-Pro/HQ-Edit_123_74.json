      "question": "Has the snowboarder's helmet been enlarged proportionally compared to their head and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet appears to fit well with the snowboarder's head, showing a size relative to their body and head that is typical for protective gear. Helmets are usually designed to provide adequate coverage without being oversized, suggesting a practical yet proportionate design. Therefore, based on common proportions in winter sports gear, the helmet does not appear enlarged compared to the snowboarder's head and body.",

      "question": "Have the snowboarder's hands been visibly enlarged compared to their arms and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's hands are depicted naturally proportionate to their arms and body. Snowboarding gloves can appear slightly large due to padding and design, but they do not seem unduly enlarged. This aligns with winter wear, where gloves are designed to offer protection and warmth while maintaining a reasonable size.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red elements of the snowboarderâ€™s outfit vivid and highly saturated, contrasting sharply with the deep blue tones of the snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's red outfit is indeed vivid and contrasts sharply with the surrounding blues of the snow and sky. This use of bright, saturated red against blue enhances visual contrast, which is a common technique in art to make the subject stand out from the background.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the snowdrifts and pine trees exhibit a paper-cut style with clean, angular edges and layered textures resembling cut paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowdrifts and pine trees show characteristics of a paper-cut style with distinct, clean edges and a layered look. This artistic approach gives the image a stylized appearance, emphasizing shapes and outlines, much like a paper cut-out.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a singular snowboarder in a specific pose, navigating a snowy slope. There are no additional snowboarding poses or indications of interchangeable action presets within the image. The composition focuses on one dynamic action scene rather than multiple or varied poses.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image is laid out on what appears to be a flat surface, possibly indicating a print or poster, but there is no specific evidence of a matte-finish collector's album or any visible typography and motifs commonly associated with such albums.",
