      "question": "Is the clock's frame made of translucent crystal instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock's frame appears to have a clear, shiny surface, suggesting it is made of a material like crystal or glass. The translucency and reflective qualities indicate a crystal composition, as opposed to the opaque, textured wood seen in traditional wooden frames. Given the clarity and characteristics visible in Image B, world knowledge tells us this suggests the use of crystal rather than wood.",

      "question": "Are the ornamental details and frame of the clock crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details and frame feature a frosted appearance with clear, detailed carvings that are visually consistent with frosted crystal. The lack of a wooden texture and the presence of a smooth, slightly cloudy finish align with common attributes of frosted crystal. In contrast, carved wood would have visible grain patterns typical of wooden materials. Hence, the visual evidence supports the conclusion that the details are made from frosted crystal.",

      "question": "Is the clock face made of smooth, clear crystal with etched Roman numerals instead of a wooden face with painted numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clock face that is smooth and clear, indicative of crystal. The Roman numerals appear etched into the surface, as evidenced by their integrated look and lack of painted surface texture. Unlike painted numerals on wood, which typically have visible brush strokes or a flat appearance, the etched numerals on crystal have a sharp, clean look. This visual assessment, paired with knowledge of material properties, suggests that the clock face is crystal with etched numerals.",

      "question": "Has the pendulum been replaced with a faceted crystal ornament instead of a solid wooden disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum has a clear, multi-faceted appearance that catches and reflects light in a prismatic way, which is indicative of a crystal ornament. In contrast, traditional wooden pendulums have a solid, opaque appearance without light reflection. The distinction between the light behavior on a faceted crystal and a solid wooden object is clear. Hence, the pendulum is likely replaced by a crystal ornament.",

      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a minimalist white marble wall with visible natural veining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears as a clean, white surface with subtle lines that resemble the natural veining found in marble, which is consistent with the aesthetic of minimalist interior design. Marble is recognized for its natural veining and white or light-colored appearance. Comparing this to typical wall surfaces, which might lack such detailed natural patterns, suggests that the clock is indeed mounted on a white marble wall.",
