    "Question": "Q1: Are the wings replaced with large, angular crystal shards in shades of opal and white?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings appear to be made of a solid material with distinct segments resembling feathers rather than angular crystal shards. They maintain the natural shape and structure of typical wings used in angelic depictions, which does not align with the description of crystal shards. Therefore, the wings are not replaced with large, angular crystal shards of opal and white shades.",

    "Question": "Q5: Has the figureâ€™s facial expression, posture, and positioning remained unchanged from the original image?",
    "explanation": "To assess this, we consider Image A. The figure in both Image A and Image B is standing in a similar posture with shoulders at the same angle and the body facing forward. Given the consistency in wing placement and overall body stance, the figure has maintained the same posture and positioning, though the facial expression cannot be judged here.",
