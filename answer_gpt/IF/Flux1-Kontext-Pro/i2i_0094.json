      "question": "Does the edited image depict the camera with intricate gears and mechanical components characteristic of steampunk design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera's design does not exhibit intricate gears or mechanical components that are typically associated with steampunk design. The visual transformation seems to emphasize a stylized texture rather than adding mechanical complexity. Common steampunk elements include gears, cogs, and intricate detailing which are not present here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the camera and tripod in the edited image rendered with a metallic finish resembling brass, iron, or similar materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the camera and tripod have a texture that is stylized, potentially suggesting metal. However, they do not distinctly resemble metallic finishes like brass or iron. There is a change in texture that may imply a metal-like appearance, but it doesn't convincingly present a metallic finish typically seen with such materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image include visible rivets, bolts, or pipe-like structures as part of the camera and tripod design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, there are no visuals of rivets, bolts, or pipe-like structures that suggests alterations to include those elements. The image is stylized, but these specific features are not incorporated into the camera and tripod design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image emphasize the metallic textures through strong contrasts and reflections, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting used does add contrast to emphasize the stylized texture, and while it gives a somewhat three-dimensional effect, it does not enhance or depict metallic textures as shiny surfaces akin to metal would. The stylization leans towards an illustrative effect rather than realistic reflections typical for metals.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate signs of aging or weathering, such as rust or scratches, on the metallic surfaces of the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not clearly show signs of aging or weathering like rust or scratches on the camera or tripod. The visual modifications have altered the color and texture, possibly suggesting an aged look, but specific indicators of aging such as rust or clear scratch marks are not evident.",
