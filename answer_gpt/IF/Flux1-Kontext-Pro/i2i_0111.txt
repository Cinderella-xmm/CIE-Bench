    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image maintain the core visual elements of Image A in the form of a glow-in-the-dark wall sticker?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the painting 'Starry Night' by Vincent van Gogh, hung above a bed in a bedroom setting. The core visual elements, including the swirling night sky and illuminated stars, are visible in Image B similar to Image A.

    "Question": "Q2: Is the glow-in-the-dark effect visible on the wall sticker depiction, indicating that it would illuminate in dark conditions?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits a lit environment with a lamp illuminating the room. There is no visible indication of a glow-in-the-dark effect actively happening on the image itself, given the ambient light present. Typically, glow-in-the-dark stickers require darkness to illuminate, and there's no evidence suggesting such an effect in Image B's depiction.",
