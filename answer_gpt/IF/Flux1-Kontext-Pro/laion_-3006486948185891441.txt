    "Question": "Q5: Does the showcase box have a seamless, flush closure suggesting a magnetic mechanism rather than a hinge or latch?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the box with straight edges and a clean finish, but there is no direct visual information available to definitively confirm the type of closure mechanism used. No hinges, latches, or apparent seams are visible, yet making assumptions about magnetic closures without explicit visual confirmation is speculative.
