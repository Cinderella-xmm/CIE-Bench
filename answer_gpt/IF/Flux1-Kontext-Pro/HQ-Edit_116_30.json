    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the cathedral rendered as a miniature model made of warm-stained wood instead of stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral exhibits a consistent warm-stained wooden appearance. This is evidenced by its uniform brownish hue typical of wood stain, rather than stone's typical grayscale or cold metallic tones. The texture and color lead to the logical conclusion that it is made of wooden material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wooden cathedral model enclosed within an ornate shadow box with visible framing and a transparent front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral model contained within a structure with wooden borders, suggesting a shadow box. The frontal view appears clear, indicating transparency, characteristic of glass or transparent plastic, revealing the model inside. This setup is consistent with a shadow box display.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the Gothic architectural details, including pointed arches, flying buttresses, and rose window tracery, visibly detailed and accurately represented in miniature form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B is rich with detailed Gothic architectural features such as pointed arches, an intricate rose window, and buttresses, all indicative of an accurate representation in miniature form. The presence of these complex elements in miniature scale reflects a high level of detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire cathedral model colored in warm stained wood tones, avoiding stone-gray or cold metallic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a consistently warm wood tone across the entire cathedral model, with no indication of stone-gray or metallic colors. The warm hue suggests a natural wooden appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there miniature pews and chandeliers visible inside the model cathedral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, miniature pews can be seen positioned in front of the cathedral model. While the chandeliers are not evidently highlighted, the question's phrasing may imply items likely found in such a setting rather than confirmed visible features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a visible clock mechanism located at the upper back part of the shadow box, as well as small human figures placed along a path in front of the model. These elements suggest an integration of time elements and possibly movement paths.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the small figures along the clockâ€™s path depict actions related to religious devotion, such as kneeling, praying, or processions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small figures are positioned upright and dispersed across the scene in a manner suggestive of casual observation rather than specific religious actions like kneeling or processions.",
