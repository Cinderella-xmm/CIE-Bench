      "question": "Is the central body of the object now a transparent glass chamber suitable for holding a candle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the object is not transparent but instead appears to be a solid, richly decorated item, resembling a teapot. Through visual inspection, it is evident that the object is not suitable for holding a candle, as it is not designed with a transparent chamber. Common sense dictates that a teapot's main functionality differs from that of a candleholder.",

      "question": "Are the floral motifs now rendered in embossed gold detail around the glass chamber?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral motifs in Image B are intricately embossed in gold detail, consistent with a traditional decorative style. However, they are not around a glass chamber; the motifs are part of the solid body of the teapot. One can deduce from the visual clues that the teapot is made of solid material, not glass, which is similar to finely ornamented objects that signify luxury.",

      "question": "Does the glass chamber exhibit a rich camel red hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the object displays a rich red hue rather than camel red, and notably, it is not a glass chamber but a part of the solid teapot structure. Thus, through careful observation, the chamber does not exist as a glass material, and the hue does not match camel red but a deeper shade typical for certain ceramics or metals.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a polished wooden lid present that mimics the contour of the original teapotâ€™s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspecting Image B reveals that there is no indication of a polished wooden lid. The teapot has a lid consistent with its ornate design but lacks the described polished wooden characteristic. The common shape of the handle does not replicate as a lid feature, which can be inferred from the typical design streams of teapots.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a visible brand logo located on the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a close examination of the base of the teapot reveals no visible brand logo. Typically, such logos would be placed subtly to not detract from ornamental detail, but where logos might be expected, there is only consistent design work. This aligns with world knowledge about formal display objects prioritizing aesthetic rather than brand display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a luxuriously patterned fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background of luxurious, patterned fabric that complements the ornate teapot design. This is observed through the textures and rich tones consistent with elegant fabric usage, in contrast to a simple background that might lack such opulence. World experience with luxury settings suggests the integration of elaborate textiles to enhance visual appeal.",
