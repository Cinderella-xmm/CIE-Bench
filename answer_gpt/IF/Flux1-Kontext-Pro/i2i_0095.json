      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' appears on the mirror, which is not part of the typical objects found on mirrors in bathrooms. It is written in a script-style font suggesting it has been added as a decorative element. This conclusion is based on the visual cue of the word and the understanding of typical mirror surfaces, which don’t have text unless explicitly designed or edited. By analyzing Image A, it's clear that no such word exists, confirming that the word 'Shine' was added during editing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' is placed in the middle, horizontally and vertically, on the mirror, giving it a central position relative to the frame of the mirror. This is determined by observing the equal spacing from the sides and the top to bottom of the mirror to the word 'Shine'.",

      "question": "Does the word “Shine” appear to have a backlit glowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' is observed to emit a glow, which suggests a backlit effect. This can be deduced from the bright white color and the illuminated appearance that mimics a lit-up sign, often used in modern decor for added emphasis and ambiance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font used for the word 'Shine' in Image B is a clean, cursive script, and the color is a luminous white, which complements the minimalistic and modern aesthetic of the bathroom. The bathroom's design includes sleek lines, monochromatic colors, and simple forms, all of which are enhanced by the elegant and understated appeal of the added word, maintaining the overall design ethos.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' is centrally positioned and possesses a soft glow that complements the existing lighting and design elements in the bathroom. The balance is maintained as the word neither overwhelms nor underwhelms the space, adding a focal point while harmonizing with the simplicity and ambient light from the mirror’s border. The aesthetic balance is preserved through alignment, color, and style consistency.",
