      "question": "Is the entire church and square scene enclosed within a visible baroque-styled dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church and square scene is clearly encapsulated within a glass dome. The dome has a prominent golden structure at its top, which is reminiscent of baroque-styled designs, often ornate and featuring intricate details. This observation, combined with world knowledge of baroque architecture and its characteristic emphasis on grandeur and detailed artistry, supports the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the church depicted with a glossy, white or off-white porcelain-like surface featuring intricate painted or molded details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the church within the dome having a real-world surface texture consistent with stone construction and not a porcelain-like appearance. The surface doesn't appear glossy or exhibit the reflective smoothness typical of porcelain materials, nor does it flaunt intricate painted or molded designs common in ceramic art.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures in the scene replaced with small, metallic gray pewter-like figures with detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures retain a more authentic, realistic coloring and surface texture rather than a monochrome, metallic gray appearance like pewter. They do not have the metallic sheen or features typically associated with pewter figurines, which suggest a durable, non-reflective metal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire diorama placed upon a visible base made of textured, veined, or aged-looking marble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the diorama's base made of a dark, polished wood material instead of textured or veined marble. While the base has a polished and elegant look, it doesn’t exhibit the distinct characteristics of aged marble, such as natural veining or textured surface typical for marble stone.",

      "question": "Are the café tables in the scene rendered as small, transparent, or reflective glass objects with delicate structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The café tables in Image B do not appear to be transparent or reflective as one would expect from glass tables. They maintain their original structure and visual characteristics consistent with typical outdoor café tables rather than delicate glass forms.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees do not exhibit any qualities of glass, such as transparency or refraction. They appear to have a realistic texture that resembles typical tree foliage rather than glass material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
