      "question": "Is the spaceship visually transformed into a style resembling a Greek amphora painting, with flat, stylized forms and decorative borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in the sky resembles a Greek amphora painting with its recognizable shape and decorative borders, replacing the spaceship. The transformation adopts flat, stylized forms typical of classical pottery design, indicating a stylistic shift. This is unlike Image A, where the object is clearly a spaceship with distinct metallic and aerodynamic features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible stylized circular motifs incorporated into the design of the spaceship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object's surface is adorned with circular motifs that are common in classical Greek pottery, consistent with the decorative styles used in amphoras. This artistic feature is intentionally added to mimic the classical style. Image A lacks any such circular motifs, focusing instead on the sleek modern lines of a spaceship.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spaceship include intricate meander patterns as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's design of the object presents patterns that resemble meander designs, which are characteristic borders in ancient Greek pottery. This adds to the traditional look, suggesting inspiration from classical designs. The original spaceship in Image A does not incorporate such decorative patterns, focusing on futuristic aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the landscape below been transformed into elongated abstract waveforms rather than realistic terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape appears abstract with undulating wave-like forms, departing from realism and embracing an artistic interpretation. This transformation provides a stylized backdrop for the amphora-like object. Image A, by contrast, displays a more realistic and proportionate landscape with clear linear features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the color palette of the landscape composed primarily of muted earth tones consistent with ancient pottery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape in Image B uses a color palette made up of muted earth tones, resonating with the warm, sandy, and clay-like hues typical of ancient pottery. These tones create harmony with the stylistic design of the object above. Image A employs more vibrant and contrasting colors that reflect a typical natural environment rather than an artful rendition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite stylistic changes, the spatial relationship in Image B, with the central object hovering above the landscape, mirrors Image A's position and scale relative to the terrain. The transformation maintains this spatial arrangement, ensuring the object remains the focal point above similar pathways. The artistic style does not alter the basic positioning and scale dynamics seen in both images.",
