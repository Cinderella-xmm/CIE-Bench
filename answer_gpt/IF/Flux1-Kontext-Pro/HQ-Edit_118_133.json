    {

      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle design, with the overall object now resembling a candle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is shaped like a pitcher or teapot but with a visible wick, which is typical of candle design. The body of the object now resembles a candle holder, further reinforced by the flame on top. This suggests that the teapot has been transformed into a candle design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object now rendered with a transparent or translucent glass-like finish consistent with a candle base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears opaque and ceramic rather than having a transparent or translucent glass-like finish. This ceramic look is consistent with decorative candle holders that are not translucent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the surface of the object exhibit a high-gloss ceramic finish instead of a metallic one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B is shiny and smooth, with a polished and glazed appearance typical of ceramic materials. Unlike the metallic finish in Image A, the glossy finish suggests a high-gloss ceramic surface in Image B.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been replaced with a visible wick extending from the top of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no spout visible on the object. Instead, a visible wick protrudes from the top, which is ignited. This aligns with the transformation of the teapot into a candle, where the wick replaces the spout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle maintains a functional form similar to that of a teapot or pitcher, but there are decorative accents and embellishments around it. However, it does not appear to be a pure decorative gold accent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
