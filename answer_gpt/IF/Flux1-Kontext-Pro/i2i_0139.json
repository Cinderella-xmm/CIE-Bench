      "question": "Is the carrot now growing inside a space greenhouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is positioned within what appears to be a metallic environment with mechanical and industrial features. This setting resembles what could be considered a controlled environment like a space greenhouse, which is often depicted with metallic and sealed interiors to simulate Earth-like conditions in space missions. Such controlled environments typically ensure plant growth in space or inhospitable regions by using advanced technology. The presence of mechanical elements and sealed chamber appearance suggest a space greenhouse.",

      "question": "Does the image include a metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber surrounding the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrot surrounded by metallic walls with visible mechanical features, such as what appear to be vents or ports. These are common characteristics of climate-controlled cultivation chambers that regulate temperature, humidity, and atmospheric composition for optimal plant growth. The metallic appearance and structured design strongly indicate that it is indeed a climate-controlled chamber.",

      "question": "Is the carrot now rooted in synthetic substrate instead of natural soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the substance surrounding the carrot appears consistent with soil-like material rather than a synthetic substrate. A synthetic substrate might be visually distinct with uniform or unusual colors or textures. However, the material looks similar to soil in texture and appearance, indicating it's likely natural soil rather than anything synthetic.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the carrot appear visibly rooted in the synthetic substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the carrot is positioned in what could be interpreted as a controlled environment, the substrate itself looks very much like standard soil rather than a synthetic version. It retains a natural, earthy texture, and the carrot appears to be planted in it as it would be in any ordinary garden setting. The visible cues do not suggest alternation to a synthetic substrate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has all evidence of the original outdoor garden environment been removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, it's noticeable that in Image B, the background and surrounding environment of the carrot have changed from an outdoor garden setting to a closed, metallic chamber. The natural elements like greenery, other carrots, and the extended soil bed are no longer visible. This change suggests that any original outdoor garden elements have been removed and replaced with a controlled, metallic environment.",
