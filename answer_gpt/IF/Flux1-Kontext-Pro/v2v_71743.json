      "question": "Does the paint splatter texture now depict iconic New York cityscapes or abstract urban art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a variety of textures across different book covers. Some covers showcase city landscapes, aligning with iconic New York cityscapes, while others present abstract designs which represent urban art. The paint splatter textures on both have been used to depict abstract art, and even the cityscape images have an abstract treatment. Since the images exhibit both elements, confirming that abstract urban art is present in Image B is reasonable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white electric guitar is consistent across each book cover, without significant redesigns or stylization that denote specific musical styles or eras.

      "question": "Does the overall design aesthetic reflect gritty subway art, sophisticated jazz age graphics, or bold modern typography?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design aesthetic of Image B features vibrant paint splatters and a bold, modern typography for the text elements, particularly in the title 'NEW YORK Guitar Method.' While subway art and jazz age graphics each have their distinct aesthetic features, the choice of typography and overall design leans towards bold modern typography rather than those specific styles.",
