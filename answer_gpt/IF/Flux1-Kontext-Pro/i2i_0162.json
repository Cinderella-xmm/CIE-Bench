      "question": "Does the image have a vibrant, clean-lined aesthetic typical of Pixar animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse features exaggeratedly large eyes and soft, rounded forms, common in Pixar-style animations that focus on creating an appealing and expressive character design. The scene also maintains vibrant colors and well-defined lines reminiscent of Pixar's clean aesthetic. These elements collectively convey an animated and stylized look typical of Pixar.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures in the image smooth and simplified in a manner consistent with cartoon-style rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mouse and surrounding elements, such as the crumbs and the floor, with simplified textures. The mouse's fur lacks realistic detail, appearing smooth, and the floor tiles have a uniform appearance without intricate patterns, aligning with cartoon-style rendering that prioritizes a smooth, minimalistic texture for animation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image feature soft shadowing around the mouse and surrounding objects, contributing to a Pixar-like depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents soft shadowing under and around the mouse, with shadows that gently contour the form, providing a sense of depth without harsh lines. This technique is consistent with Pixar animations, where shadows are used to enhance the dimensionality and integrate elements naturally into the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the lighting in the image been adjusted to create a soft, diffused effect typical of Pixar animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is diffused, bathing the scene in a gentle, evenly distributed light that reduces harsh contrasts, evokes a warm atmosphere, and highlights the mouse and environment subtly. This is characteristic of Pixar's lighting style, which often employs soft lighting to enhance the storytelling and warmth of a scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all elements in the image, including the floor, crumbs, and background, appear to be seamlessly integrated in a Pixar-style animation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements such as the floor, crumbs, the mouse, and the kitchen background are harmoniously rendered with a cohesive color palette and style. This integration, without any part seeming out of place or inconsistent, is akin to Pixar-style animation where each element is designed to complement each other within the animated environment.",
