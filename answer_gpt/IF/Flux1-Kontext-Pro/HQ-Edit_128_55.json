        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the door is no longer a typical wooden structure but is now incorporated into a creature that has strong mythical or fantastical characteristics.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are large feathered wings visible on either side of the creature.
