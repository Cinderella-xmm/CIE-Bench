      "question": "Has a poem been added at the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a text has been incorporated at the bottom part of the image, and it's presented in a manner suggestive of a poem or poetic text. This conclusion is derived from observing the layout and spacing that is typical for poems, which often consist of brief lines in a somewhat artistic format.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the poem exactly read: “A beam of morning light, a soft whisper, an unnamed yellow bird perching on a branch”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the text from Image B, it reads: 'A beam of morning light, soft whisper, an unnamed yellow bird perching on at branch.' Notably, there's a mismatch with the original wording presented in the question. The words 'a soft whisper' are replaced with 'soft whisper,' and the phrase 'on at branch' appears as an error in placing 'at.'",

      "question": "Is the poem placed at the bottom section of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is evidently positioned at the bottom of the image, fitting the space below the central visual content of the bird. This placement allows it to be prominently displayed without encroaching upon the main subject of the image.",

      "question": "Has the image quality been maintained after adding the poem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the text overlay on Image B does not seem to distort or degrade the visual quality of the photographic elements present. The colors, clarity, and focus on the bird remain intact, ensuring the additional element does not compromise the initial image quality.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font style chosen for the poem in Image B features a classic serif typeface that harmonizes well with the soft and natural aesthetic of the image. This choice resonates with traditional and artistic sensibilities, making it suitable alongside the serene depiction of the bird and surrounding background.",
