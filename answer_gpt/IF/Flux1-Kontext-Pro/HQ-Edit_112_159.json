      "question": "Is the car and coastal road enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible edges and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and coastal road scene is visibly enclosed within a clear, transparent glass display case. The edges and reflections of the glass are evident around the scene, clearly indicating it is encased. This visual element is not present in Image A, which depicts the car on a road without such enclosure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car exhibit metallic red coloring with visible gradient hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a car with a striking metallic red finish. The paint shows variations in light reflection, creating gradient hues that are common with metallic finishes, enhancing the car's visual appeal. Image A also shows the car with metallic red color, indicating no change in this specific aspect between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines present on the car’s bodywork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car displays dynamic curves and sharp lines typical of sports car design, providing an aerodynamic and aggressive appearance. These features are visually apparent, highlighting the vehicle's streamlined aesthetics. Image A also shows the same detailing, as the car's design remains unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the road and coastal cliffs with an appearance that suggests a crafted, layered resin construction. The visual effect of stratification and depth gives it a artificial, model-like quality consistent with diorama craftsmanship, distinguishing it from the real-world depiction in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the road and cliffs are detailed to include micro gravel textures, adding a tactile dimension typical of detailed model landscapes or dioramas. These textures provide visual depth and realism in the small-scale representation. Image A, however, doesn't showcase such textures as it depicts a realistic setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B shows the diorama with a sunset sky background, this element is part of the scene itself rather than a separate panel at the top of the display case. The sky serves as the scenic backdrop, not an individual component of the case structure. There's no panel defining the upper boundary within the visible design.",
