      "question": "Does the image feature a gradient background with pastel colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features very vibrant and strong colors, prominent with neon shades like purple and pink, which are typical in a vaporwave theme, rather than soft, muted pastel colors. Pastel colors are generally known for their light and delicate hues, which is not evident in this image. The choice of neon lighting creates a bold and striking scene, quite different from what pastel tones would achieve. Hence, Image B does not feature a gradient background with pastel colors.",

      "question": "Are there visible neon lighting effects around the mirror or sink area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays neon lighting effects, particularly evident through the bright pink and purple hues around the mirror and sink area. These neon colors cast a vivid glow on the surfaces, creating a visually striking and artificial light effect that is characteristic of neon lighting. This kind of effect is typically used to create a bold, futuristic look, which is clearly the case here.",

      "question": "Has the overall bathroom scene been transformed into a retro-futuristic style characteristic of vaporwave?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays key features of a vaporwave aesthetic: it includes bright neon colors, particularly purples and pinks, and the lighting effects that give the scene a retro-futuristic ambience. Vaporwave often involves these types of colors and stylistic choices to evoke a sense of nostalgia mixed with futuristic elements from the 1980s and 1990s visual culture. The transformation of the scene into this characteristic style is evident.",

      "question": "Is the gradient background consistently applied throughout the bathroom scene without disrupting the visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B, comprised of neon hues, is applied uniformly with consistent intensity across the scene, covering all visible wall areas around the mirror and sink. This provides a coherent visual experience, as there are no abrupt changes or inconsistencies in the color gradient's application, maintaining the designed atmosphere of the vaporwave style throughout the image.",

      "question": "Do the original objects like the mirror, sink, and cabinet retain their form but now reflect a vaporwave design influence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects in Image B, such as the mirror, sink, and cabinet, retain their structural form as seen in Image A. However, the influence of vaporwave design is evident due to the neon lighting and color palette applied to them. Although the physical forms remain unchanged, the lighting and color effects transform their appearance to match the retro-futuristic vaporwave aesthetic, providing a sense of stylistic change without altering their actual shape or construction.",
