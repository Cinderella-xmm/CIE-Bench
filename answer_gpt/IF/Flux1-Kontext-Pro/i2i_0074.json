        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dominant text at the top center that reads 'IDEAL HOME'.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the bottom of the image, there are multiple smaller text elements that appear as section headings. They are styled in a way that suggests categories typical in magazines, such as 'Bedroom Mastery' and 'Price Recondition', which are relevant to home design topics. This alignment and style suggest these are section headings intended to indicate content within a magazine.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes text modules at the bottom, one of which mentions 'Price Recondition', hinting at discussions or recommendations about pricing, typically found in articles evaluating costs or making recommendations.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image A reveals a bedroom setup featuring a bed, bedside tables, lamps, a plant, and a painting. Image B maintains identical visual elements in terms of furniture placement and decor. The addition of text elements doesn't alter the original setup, ensuring the bedroom's setting remains consistent.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the text 'Ideal Home' prominently at the top, aligning with typical magazine cover designs where the title is placed for immediate recognition. The section headings and text modules are strategically positioned to mimic common magazine layouts, typically at the bottom or sides, providing content teasers in an organized manner. This structure clearly follows a magazine cover format.",
