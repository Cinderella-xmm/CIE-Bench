      "question": "Is the elephant depicted as a smaller-scale version enclosed within a transparent glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is visibly enclosed within a glass display case, which indicates a smaller-scale model. The glass display case's reflection can be seen, and the overall proportion of the elephant to its surroundings suggests a miniature version. Common sense and visual cues confirm this depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate armor details on the elephant rendered with a shiny, metallic-resin-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor on the elephant in Image B exhibits a shiny appearance with a metallic sheen. This suggests a texture similar to metallic resin, commonly used in ornamental or decorative items. The analysis involves recognizing the reflective quality and the detailed rendering, which is consistent with such materials.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there four small golden banners made of silk-like material positioned at each corner of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows decorations at the corners of the glass display case, but they are hard, golden corner ornaments, not silk-like banners. Visual assessment from the image displays solid materials, and general knowledge about display cases aligns with typically used corner decorations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a backdrop with mountains that have soft edges and layers, creating a translucent appearance. This layering effect results in gentle silhouettes, often seen in artistic or decorative displays where depth is suggested without sharp separations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small trees resembling bonsai trees placed within the foreground of the display case, appearing stylized and placed deliberately for scenic effect. These visual cues coupled with general design principles for themed displays indicate a bonsai-like style.",
