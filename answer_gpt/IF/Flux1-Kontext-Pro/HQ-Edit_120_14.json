      "question": "Has the overall form of the bicycle been transformed into a creature-like structure resembling a steampunk insect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bicycle maintains its traditional form with familiar components such as wheels, handlebars, and a seat. While the style suggests an aged, rusty aesthetic, characteristic of vintage designs, there are no additions or transformations that resemble a creature-like or insect-like structure typical of steampunk designs. The shape and components remain consistent with a standard bicycle. Thus, common steampunk attributes such as creature-like structures are absent.",

      "question": "Are the frame components replaced with an exoskeleton structure featuring visible cogwheel joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle's frame appears as a classic form with visible signs of rust, suggesting an old, vintage style. The joint areas and overall frame architecture do not show any alterations to resemble an exoskeleton or include cogwheel joints, which are typical of steampunk designs where mechanical elements are prominently featured. The frame remains the standard metal structure without any unusual steampunk modifications.",

      "question": "Has the bicycle seat been transformed into a detailed, ornate carapace resembling an insect's back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the bicycle seat exhibits a traditional leather look, devoid of any complex or ornate design elements that would mimic an insect's carapace. The seat is plain and functional, aligning with vintage bicycle aesthetics rather than an elaborate carapace transformation. Therefore, no transformation into an insect-like or ornate structure is present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have both wheels been replaced with hinged, mechanical leg structures instead of traditional circular wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, both wheels retain their conventional circular form with spokes and the rim structure, without any modifications or replacements. Hinged or mechanical leg structures would be distinctly different, featuring articulated parts typical of steampunk designs. The traditional wheel structure remains unchanged, indicating no transformation into leg-like structures.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there copper-colored, wing-like extensions attached along the top bar of the bicycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a bicycle with its top bar exposed, yet devoid of any copper-colored, wing-like extensions. The top bar retains its basic form as seen in vintage bicycles, where additional features such as wings would be visually significant alterations. The absence of any wing-like structures indicates that no such extensions have been added.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, the handlebar area is traditional with standard grips and no visible alterations or additions like clock faces or mysterious runes. Such features would require notable modification making them prominently visible. The lack of these elements suggests that the handlebars remain unchanged with no steampunk-inspired decorations.",
