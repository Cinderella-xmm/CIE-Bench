      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug possesses attributes typical of a sculpture, such as uniform color and texture resembling wood, polished surfaces, and a static pose. These characteristics are common in sculptures rather than living animals, which have natural fur, varied textures, and dynamic poses. The lack of fur texture and the presence of a uniform surface indicate a carved wooden sculpture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the fur been replaced with smooth, polished wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pug with a surface resembling a smooth, polished material, where fur would typically be visible. The texture appears consistent with wood grain, given the visible lines and smooth surface akin to polished wood, rather than the roughness or varied length characteristic of animal fur.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pug sculpture in Image B retains a light brown and dark brown color palette similar to the original pug's fur colors. These tones are consistent with walnut wood colors, which vary from light to dark brown. This consistency in color helps maintain the pug's color pattern while introducing walnut-like shades.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the pug, such as wrinkles and folds, seem to be defined by carved lines and edges. Unlike soft skin folds, which appear rounded and pliable, these features are geometric and precise, indicative of sculpting techniques used to highlight details in a wooden material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden pug placed on a simple black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the pug sitting atop a simple, dark-colored base without ornamentation or additional details. The base appears circular and black, contrasting with the tones of the wooden pug, providing a platform typically used to display sculptures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the black base provide a stark contrast to the rich wood texture of the sculpture, emphasizing its craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black base in Image B provides a significant contrast to the lighter, warm tones of the wood grain texture of the pug sculpture. This contrast highlights the fine detailing and craftsmanship of the sculpture by focusing attention on its surface textures and carved features, which stand out against the dark background.",
