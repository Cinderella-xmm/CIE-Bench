      "question": "Has the woman’s outfit and overall image been rendered in a cartoon style with exaggerated features and simplified lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s attire and form are depicted with bold outlines and flat colors, characteristic of a cartoon style. The image uses simplified shapes and lacks detailed texture, which are typical features of cartoon-style illustrations. In contrast, Image A portrays the woman with realistic textures and shading. Therefore, Image B has rendered the woman’s outfit and overall image in a cartoon style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns in Image B maintain a similar size and layout to those in Image A, though Image B presents them in a more simplified and stylized manner due to the cartoon-style rendering.
