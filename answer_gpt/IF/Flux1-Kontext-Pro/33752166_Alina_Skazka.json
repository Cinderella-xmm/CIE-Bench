      "question": "Does the edited image show the building transformed into a giant mechanical golem with visible articulated limbs and exposed gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is a mechanical golem with articulated limbs and visible mechanical components, exhibiting characteristics common to humanoid robots. This conclusion is drawn from the presence of rounded joints, visible gears, and limb-like appendages. Without referring to Image A, this visual information and common knowledge suggest a transformation from an inanimate structure to a humanoid figure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all original windows replaced with glowing energy panels that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical golem features illuminated panels, resembling energy-emitting components. These glowing features are visible on various parts of its torso and limbs. Without referring to Image A, the overall impression suggests an object designed for energy emission rather than static building windows.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the balconies been transformed into arm-like mechanical appendages extending from the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible articulated limbs resemble arm-like appendages typical of mechanical or robotic structures. These limbs appear functional, unlike static architectural features such as balconies seen in buildings. Without referring to Image A, this visual and common knowledge indicates a transformation from architectural elements to mechanical limbs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate circuit patterns covering the surface of the building, resembling electronic wiring or circuits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical texture features raised panels and visible screws, but there are no clear patterns resembling electronic circuitry on the surface of the golem. Without referring to Image A, the mechanical design suggests functional armor rather than intricate electronic wiring.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the building's angular edges appear as dynamic or movable mechanical components, such as hinges, pistons, or rotating joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical golem contains rounded joints and segmented armor, elements typically associated with movable mechanical components. Without referring to Image A, these design features indicate that parts of the structure are intended for movement, contrasting with static architectural edges.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background still a clear blue sky without any changes or additions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background remains a clear blue sky, which matches the clarity seen in typical outdoor images under natural light. Without referring to Image A, the unchanged backdrop supports the perception of continuity in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the buildingâ€™s overall size and position within the frame remained consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Referring to Image A, the original building occupies a significant portion of the frame from a low angle. Comparison with Image B reveals a transformation into a mechanical golem, yet it occupies a similar frame position and apparent size. The golem's position and scale are consistent in the image context, suggesting continuity.",
