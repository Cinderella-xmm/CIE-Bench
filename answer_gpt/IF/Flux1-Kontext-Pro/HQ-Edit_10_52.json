        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the woman is more illustrative and cartoonish, with softer lines and less detailed textures compared to a realistic portrayal.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the dress indeed appear larger and more prominent than in a realistic depiction.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the dress are vibrant and saturated, giving off a sense of luminosity. This effect is typical in painted or digitally created images where enhanced color saturation contributes to a lively and eye-catching visual impact. The hues are more pronounced than in more muted, realistic color schemes.",

      "question": "Are abstract, non-realistic bamboo shadows present in the image to enhance depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a flat, illustrative style without realistic shadows and lighting, which are often exaggerated or abstracted in such art to enhance stylistic depth rather than create realistic depiction. The bamboo in the background does not cast realistic shadows but is instead depicted in a way that maintains the illustrative theme.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a bamboo-themed decorative element to the left, which resembles a panel framed by softer bamboo motifs. This is indicative of a space often used for text or artistic framing within a stylized, illustrative context. Such elements are typical in traditional art or illustrations where motifs serve as frames or panels for writing or enhancing thematic design.",
