      "question": "Has snow been added to the clock tower and the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is visible snow accumulated on the roof, ledges, and the surroundings of the clock tower, including snowflakes falling and snow covering the landscape, indicative of winter conditions. This suggests that snow has indeed been added to the scene. Comparing Image A, which has a clear and summery appearance with no snow, further supports this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the flags been replaced with icy patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flags in Image B exhibit a more muted color scheme and the appearance of possible frost or snow on them, which could suggest an icy pattern. However, the pattern of stripes remains similar to Image A, and the change might result from a wintry hue rather than a distinct ice pattern replacement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the overall scene reflect a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains snow on the ground, roof, and ledges of the clock tower, along with falling snowflakes and snow-covered trees, conveying a winter ambiance. All these features combined indicate a winter setting. Image A presents a clear sky without any snow, accentuating the change to a wintry scene in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there visible snow accumulation on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, Image B has visible snow accumulation on the roof and ledges of the clock tower. This is seen in the way snow is piling up and covering parts of the architecture, indicative of snow accumulation typical in winter scenarios. Observing Image A further confirms that this was added as it was previously absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the flags display distinct icy patterns that differ from the original green and yellow stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flags in Image B appear to have some alterations due to the winter setting, such as appearing slightly frosted or muted, but they maintain the same stripe pattern. Comparing to Image A, the pattern itself hasn't changed - only the environmental effect of snow and possible frost has affected their appearance.",
