      "question": "Are the lily flowers now composed of transparent, amber-tinted crystal-like material with visible jagged facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows flowers that appear to be made from a material resembling crystal. The petals are transparent and have an amber tint, indicative of a crystal-like material. The facets are visible and have a jagged appearance. This differs significantly from typical flower compositions, suggesting that the flowers in Image B are indeed made of a transparent, faceted material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the petals retain their original lily shape but appear constructed from layered, sharp-edged crystal facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers indeed maintain a shape similar to lilies, but the material rendering gives them a unique appearance with layered, sharp-edged facets indicative of a crystal structure. This construction method maintains the floral shape while altering the material to resemble crystal facets.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the green stems and leaves been completely replaced with delicate, transparent glass rods extending from the vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the stems appear to still be green and have not been replaced with transparent glass rods. They extend from the vase with the same organic appearance as typical plant stems rather than glass rods. Thus, the stems in Image B retain their original form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the surface underneath the vase is dark and has faint visible veining patterns consistent with marble, leading to the conclusion that the bouquet is placed on a black marble tabletop.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given Image B, the combination of crystal-like flowers, the glass vase, and the marble tabletop results in a sophisticated and artistic arrangement. The materials used suggest a crafted and refined aesthetic characteristic of fine art, making the composition cohesive and elegant.",
