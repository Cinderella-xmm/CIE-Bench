      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the elephant teapot and base, enclosed within a curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly enclosed within a curved glass dome. This is evidenced by the visible curved reflections and the outline of the glass, which surrounds the teapot and the base, giving the scene an enclosed appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible gears and copper-colored accents added to the surface of the elephant teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the elephant teapot does not have visible gears or copper-colored accents. The teapot appears intricately detailed but maintains a consistent single-color scheme, similar to traditional metalwork, rather than incorporating industrial elements like gears.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base feature simulated wooden floorboards with scattered tea leaves and tiny silver utensils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base does not show simulated wooden floorboards nor scattered tea leaves or silver utensils. Instead, the base appears to be a wooden platform with moss and small plants, rather than scattered elements or utensils.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are soft moss accents visibly embedded in the base area inside the glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base does feature soft moss accents that are clearly visible and embedded within the area inside the glass dome. The moss gives a natural, garden-like appearance to the base of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there visible steam emanating from the tip of the elephantâ€™s trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed visible steam emanating from the tip of the elephant's trunk. The steam is shown as a wispy, white trail above the trunk, indicating that the teapot is conceptually 'in use.'",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the scene surrounded by intricate, vine-like metalwork that forms part of the dome or base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the scene does feature intricate, vine-like metalwork, which forms part of the base structure. This detailing is consistent with the decorative theme seen on the teapot itself.",
