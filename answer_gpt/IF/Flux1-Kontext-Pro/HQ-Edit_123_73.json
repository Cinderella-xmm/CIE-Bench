    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pyramid's steps visibly transformed into segmented, armored body parts resembling a mythical creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, we see that the pyramid's steps now have features that resemble scales or armor, typical in mythical creatures. The presence of a dragon-like head at the top reinforces this interpretation. Utilizing the visual cues and mythical creature design knowledge, the answer is deduced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the original entrance of the pyramid replaced with a mystical eye featuring an iris and pupil, positioned centrally at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the pyramid is adorned with a dragon-like head instead of an entrance. There is no evidence of an eye positioned centrally at the top. The analysis is based on the visible features in the image, combined with the absence of traditional entrance elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the surrounding jungle been transformed into detailed, interconnected vine-like scale patterns covering the ground and vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jungle in Image B maintains its appearance, with lush greenery and trees without evident transformation into vine-like scale patterns. The visual analysis is performed from the specific query about scale patterns, and the vegetation does not reflect such characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the base of the creature display visible ancient stone patterns such as glyphs, carvings, or geometric designs consistent with the templeâ€™s style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the pyramid creature maintains a consistent stone pattern with ancient geometric designs that are akin to glyphs or carvings seen in architectural styles of pyramids. This is derived from recognizing typical elements consistent with historical contexts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing plants or flowers around the creature that resemble or are inspired by architectural features of the pyramid, such as stepped forms or symbolic carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts vibrant jungle surroundings, but lacks glowing plants or floral elements that specifically reflect pyramid architectural styles. The visual inspection does not indicate glowing flora directly linked to the pyramid facets.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire structure transformed into a cohesive, mythical guardian creature with all elements (armor, eye, scales, base, flora) harmoniously integrated to create a strong fantastical impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a pyramid transformed into a fantastical entity, with scaled steps, a dragon-like head at the top, and consistent ancient patterns at the base. These elements collectively create a mythical guardian impression, despite the lack of eyes or glowing flora, resulting in the deduction of a cohesive transformation.",
