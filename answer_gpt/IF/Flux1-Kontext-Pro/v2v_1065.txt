    "Question": "Q1: Is the individual depicted as a dynamic, chibi-style 3D figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the individual is captured as if they are inside a 3D object, more specifically a snow globe, but they do not appear in a chibi style. Chibi, in artistic contexts, refers to deliberately exaggerated characters, often with oversized heads and small bodies, which is not the case here. The individual retains realistic proportions similar to those in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the character performing a skateboarding trick inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the individual is seen inside a snow globe performing a skateboarding trick based on their mid-air posture with a skateboard beneath their feet, which implies action and momentum, consistent with skateboarding tricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the snow globe still includes palm trees and a skate park setting, suggesting that these elements are present within the globe's environment. It resembles the exterior scene in a smaller scale.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is snow gently falling inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "In the visual of Image B, there is no indication of snow falling inside the snow globe. Typically, a snow globe depicts falling snowflakes, but here, we see clear details of the scene without such visual effects present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the snow globe placed on a table near a window, with the window overlooking a blurred skate park?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe positioned on a wooden table, illuminated by sunlight filtering through a window. While the view suggests daylight and greenery outside, it is not clear whether the exterior specifically shows a skate park due to the natural blur of the outside visible through the window.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do rays of light filter through the glass, creating radiant highlights?",
    "explanation": "The image depicts sunlight entering through a window and interacting with the spherical glass surface of the snow globe, resulting in visible highlights and reflective effects inside and outside the globe. This interaction creates a gleaming effect commonly associated with light filtering through glass.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Has the original background been replaced with the described setting?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) incorporates the individual and background of palm trees and a skate park-like setting into the interior of a snow globe. While the original scene remains, the context and presentation are altered by its confinement within a snow globe on a table. This environment reflects a significant setting alteration from the original outdoor scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
