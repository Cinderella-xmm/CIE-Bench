      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall scene rendered in a pop art style with bright, flat colors and comic book-like aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an artistic style that is characterized by the use of bold, bright colors and simplified forms, typical of pop art. The imagery is reminiscent of comic book illustrations, where colors are highly saturated and adhere to flat planes without gradients, contributing to a surreal and eye-catching aesthetic. This conclusion is drawn from the absence of detailed shading, the presence of halftone patterns, and the vivid color choices that deviate from realistic representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train feature bold primary colors (such as red, blue, or yellow) and halftone dot patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is depicted with vibrant yellow, red, and blue colors, which are primary colors often used in pop art. Additionally, there are noticeable halftone dot patterns covering its surface, contributing to its comic book-style look. This is consistent with pop art techniques where such patterns are utilized to simulate shadows and gradients.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the barnâ€™s wooden texture been replaced with stylized geometric shapes instead of realistic wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the barn with stylized textures that resemble geometric simplifications rather than intricate, realistic wood grain. The artistic representation emphasizes bold outlines and uniform color applications, which differ significantly from the detailed textures typically found in natural wooden surfaces. This abstraction is a characteristic of pop art styles that favor more graphic representations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the trees and grass been converted into vibrant, abstract, graphic bursts rather than realistic vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and grass are depicted in a highly stylized manner, using bright tones of red, blue, and yellow with bold outlines. They lack the intricate detailing and variations found in natural vegetation and instead adopt more graphic shapes and patterns, akin to abstract art. This style emphasizes visual impact over realistic depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features all major components such as the train, barn, tracks, and foliage outlined with distinctive, sharp black lines. This technique is typical of comic book illustrations and pop art style, where black outlines are utilized to define shapes clearly and create contrasts against vivid color blocks, enhancing visual clarity and artistic expression.",
