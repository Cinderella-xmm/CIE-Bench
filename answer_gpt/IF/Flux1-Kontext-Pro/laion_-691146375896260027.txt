    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser does not appear to be constructed from LEGO bricks. It maintains a realistic appearance with wood textures and gold-colored decorative patterns, which are indicative of a traditional piece of furniture rather than a LEGO construction. The polished textures and intricate detailing suggest real materials rather than the uniform studded pattern of LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?",
    "explanation": "The decorative patterns on the dresser in Image B show a level of intricate detail and smoothness that is not typical of LEGO pieces, which tend to have more blocky and less detailed connections. These patterns appear to be ornately carved or inlaid parts of the furniture, not assembled from LEGO pieces. Therefore, the decorative patterns do not match the characteristics of LEGO piece constructions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the curved sides and legs of the dresser constructed using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "The curved sides and legs of the dresser in Image B do not exhibit the characteristics of LEGO pieces, which typically connect in more angular ways. The smooth and continuous curves seen here suggest traditional woodworking rather than a construction based on LEGO bricks, which would display visible joins and studs even if using carefully placed sloped pieces.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the marble top been replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles?",
    "explanation": "The top of the dresser in Image B does appear gray, which could be mistaken for flat LEGO tiles. However, the surface is uniform and smooth, lacking the typical studded appearance of LEGO tiles. It seems to mimic a solid material such as stone or marble rather than a LEGO construction, as there are no visible connectors or modular tile boundaries.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the dresser placed on a neutral, plain background that does not distract from the LEGO structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed neutral and plain, allowing the focus to remain on the dresser. However, since the dresser is not constructed from LEGO bricks but is a traditional wooden piece, it is irrelevant to distract from a LEGO structure. The purpose of the plain background is to highlight the object, irrespective of its material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the LEGO dresser maintain the original two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs around each drawer?",
    "explanation": "The dresser in Image B maintains a two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs on the front. The continuous, intricate nature of the frames suggests real craftsmanship rather than assembly from LEGO pieces, as LEGO constructions would show modularity and less intricate detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all surfaces of the dresser visibly composed of LEGO bricks, with no realistic wood or metal textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces are visibly composed of realistic wood and metal textures rather than LEGO bricks. The detailed wood grain and polished look of the decorative metalwork do not match the modular, plastic appearance of LEGO bricks, which would have continuous studs even in the most polished builds.",
    "answer": "No"
