      "question": "Is the cup and saucer combined into a single, oval-shaped object resembling a mythical phoenix egg?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cup and saucer remain distinct objects. The design does not merge them into a single, oval shape like an egg. The golden and jeweled enhancements make them visually striking, but they do not transform into a mythical phoenix egg-like object. The visual cues show enhancements and thematic design changes but maintain the traditional cup and saucer structure.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle of the cup in Image B is indeed reshaped compared to Image A. It now includes an embellished wing-like design with intricate feather details, giving it an ornate appearance. This transformation contrasts with the simple handle design seen in Image A, highlighting the addition of a decorative, wing-like form.",
