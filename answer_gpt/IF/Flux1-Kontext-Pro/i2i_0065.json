        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting looks like a museum exhibit corner because the dog is encased in what appears to be a glass display box, and there are other blurred artifacts visible in the background, resembling a gallery or museum setup.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be evenly distributed rather than directly focused on the dog's face. The lighting within a museum display case is often balanced to evenly illuminate the exhibit.",
