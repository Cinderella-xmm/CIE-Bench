      "question": "Is the black checkmark pathway depicted as tangled and circuitous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presentation of the pathway is visibly complex and wavy, diverging from a straightforward or linear path. The intertwined design suggests a tangled and circuitous route. This is indicative of process complexity, commonly associated with indirect or convoluted processes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 'We verify your Document' icon show multiple overlapping stamps of approval?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'We verify your Document' icon features a single image of a document with a checkmark. There is no indication of multiple or overlapping stamps of approval, as the icon only shows one document being checked or approved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visual motifs of entangled red tape woven through the orange circular step markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features red lines that encircle and intersect the orange circular step markers, suggesting entangled red tape. This visual cue alludes to bureaucratic complexities and procedural hurdles, commonly symbolized by 'red tape'.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the infographic reflect an adaptation to increased bureaucratic complexity for Qatar document processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes multiple signs of increased bureaucratic complexity, such as the tangled pathway and entwined red tape motifs. These elements illustrate a more convoluted process compared to the direct path in Image A. Such design choices are often used to symbolize complicated or time-consuming procedural landscapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the infographic maintain coherence and clarity despite the added complexity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the introduction of tangled pathways and red tape could detract from coherence and clarity. Despite the additional complexity, the pathway's direction remains recognizable. However, the excessive intertwining may impair immediate comprehension and intuitiveness, rendering the design less effective in communicating a straightforward, clear process.",
