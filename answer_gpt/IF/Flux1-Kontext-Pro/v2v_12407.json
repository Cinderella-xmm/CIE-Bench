      "question": "Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is illustrated with visible blocky shapes and pixelation, which is a typical feature of 8-bit graphics. The edges are not smooth, and the overall appearance lacks detail, focusing instead on large, square color blocks. Observing the large pixels helps identify this style as reminiscent of early video game graphics, which were constrained by technical limitations. This visual cue strongly suggests the use of pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics.",

      "question": "Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the table and the napkin display large color blocks, a trait of low-resolution depiction typical of 8-bit graphics. The table surface and the napkin lack fine details and textures, appearing with fewer details and simpler shapes. Such an approach is consistent with how graphics in 8-bit styles are often rendered, using simple blocks to create recognizable forms without intricate detailing.",

      "question": "Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a restricted set of colors, which aligns with the characteristics of an 8-bit color palette. The mango, table, and napkin are composed of simple, flat colors without gradients or shading variations, demonstrating the use of few distinct colors. This approach is typical of early digital graphics, where technical constraints limited the number of colors available.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights are rendered using large pixels without smooth gradients, producing a flat shading effect. This visual style simplifies the light and shadow interplay, reducing them to basic color shifts rather than nuanced variations. Such simplification is characteristic of 8-bit graphics, where shading is minimal due to graphical constraints.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an overall composition that is notably simplified, concentrating on basic shapes and forms constructed with large pixel blocks. There is an absence of detailed textures or intricate elements, replaced by straightforward lines and structures. This minimalistic approach aligns with the aesthetic of 8-bit graphics, which rely on the simplicity due to their technical limitations.",
