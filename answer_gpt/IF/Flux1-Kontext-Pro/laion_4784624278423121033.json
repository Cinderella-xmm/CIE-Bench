      "question": "Has the circular dough been replaced with a realistic atom illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple atom-shaped illustrations that resemble stylized atom models, each with different elements and possibly different color schemes. These illustrations have replaced the area that featured a circular dough imprint in Image A. The original dough does not appear to be included in Image B, only various stylized representations of atomic structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple atom-shaped cookie designs centered in the image, each in a different color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features three rows of atom-shaped illustrations, each with distinct colors and styles, indicating that they represent different atomic models. These designs are centrally positioned within the image, taking up the majority of the space.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there arrows pointing to and labeling electrons, protons, and neutrons on the atom illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are a few elements within the illustrations that closely resemble labels or highlights. For example, one of the atom illustrations includes an arrow, potentially pointing to represent electron movement. Other labels like 'PROTONS' and 'NEURONS' seem to denote atomic components. Thus, symbolic representations for atomic particles do exist.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the various atom-shaped designs are separated into sections by dotted lines, creating a grid-like system that segments each illustration for clarity and organization.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B incorporates bright and varied colors such as teal, red, and yellow, which contrast sharply with the more natural tones seen in Image A such as beige and brown of the dough and white of the cutter. The colors in Image B are vivid and less earth-toned compared to Image A.",
