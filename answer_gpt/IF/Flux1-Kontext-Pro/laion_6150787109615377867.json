      "question": "Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop is a round component with intricate engravings and structural details reminiscent of mechanical parts, which closely resembles a gear. The presence of visible teeth and detailed engravings on the tabletop, common in gear designs, indicates that it has been altered to look like a gear-shaped component.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the table legs been morphed into articulated, piston-driven limbs with visible joints and brass or copper-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table legs are designed to resemble articulated limbs, featuring visible joints and mechanical details such as pistons. The color scheme includes brass or copper-like tones, typical of steampunk aesthetics, and these visual cues indicate that the table legs have been transformed to resemble piston-driven limbs.",

      "question": "Are there visible steam vents placed along the central column of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the central column is heavily detailed with mechanical and steampunk elements, there are no visible steam vents present along the column. A steam vent would typically have openings or grill-like structures where steam could be emitted, which are not apparent in this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the table in Image B contains detailed mechanical features reminiscent of steampunk design, including patterns that resemble cog structures. However, there is no visible rotating dial or gauge element present, which would usually be signified by numerical markings or pointers typical of gauges.",

      "question": "Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a table that has been modified to appear as a steampunk-style mechanized entity. The presence of anthropomorphic features such as mechanical limbs, a central body resembling a torso with intricate detail, and a gear-like tabletop contribute to the visual impression of a living machine inspired by steampunk aesthetics.",
