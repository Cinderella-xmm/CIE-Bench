      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral staircase retains its architectural structure with visible stairs, steps, and balustrade, which are typical features of a standard staircase design. There are no visual cues or indicators in Image B that suggest a transformation into a serpent-like creature, as the architectural elements remain unchanged and consistent with a typical staircase.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steps in Image B appear as typical staircase steps made of stone or similar material, showing clear definition and separation typical of stairs rather than the interconnected or overlapping pattern that would suggest reptilian scales. The texture and appearance align with standard architectural features rather than a biological or reptilian pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railing maintains its appearance as a typical wooden balustrade. The balusters are vertically aligned and consistent with traditional railings, rather than resembling vertebrae or bone structures. There is no transformation into organic or skeletal features observed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a wooden railing with typical wooden textures and patterns. However, these are consistent with crafted wood used in construction rather than resembling bone or a skeletal framework. There is no indication of integration into a serpent figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The staircase in Image B appears to be built with stone steps, showcasing the normal flat surface associated with staircases. There are no raised or ridged stone textures as would be characteristic of a serpent's body. Thus, such textures indicating a serpentine transformation are absent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spirals of the staircase in Image B are architecturally sound and reflect the helicoidal design typical of spiral staircases. Although spiral staircases naturally have a coil-like structure, in this context, they do not visually mimic a serpent's organic coils but maintain their structural integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent creature exhibit visual traits suggesting antiquity and natural grandeur (such as weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a typical stone and wood staircase, with textures suggesting aged architectural material rather than suggesting antiquity in the sense of a natural or organic phenomenon. The colors and shapes correspond more to man-made structures than to a grand and ancient natural creature.",

      "model_answer": "No",
