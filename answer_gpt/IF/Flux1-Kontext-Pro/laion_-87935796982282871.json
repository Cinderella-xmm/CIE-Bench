      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the two images: Image A has a blanket with distinct blocks of red, gray, navy, and white colors. Image B has colors that appear red, gray, and beige/cream - potentially excluding navy and white, suggesting the fur's color palette is slightly altered and contains beige instead. Thus it doesn't precisely match the original colors as Image A.",
