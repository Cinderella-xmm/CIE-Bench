      "question": "Are there exactly five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe two prominent nesting dolls and a smaller one next to the shoe, totaling three dolls. The visual cues indicate a playful design with a lime-green color similar to the shoe, suggesting chibi-style nesting dolls. This contradicts the presence of five dolls; therefore, based on the number of objects visually identifiable, the answer is no more than three dolls are present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a vibrant lime-green color and texture similar to the shoe and tennis ball in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nesting dolls with a striking lime-green color and texture, very similar to the shoe beside them. The texture appears to be faux leather-like, resembling the shoe material. Understanding that this contrasts the tennis ball from Image A, which has a distinct fuzzy texture, visually confirms that the vibrant color and texture relationship with Image A's shoe is consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from largest to smallest in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B clearly shows nesting dolls organized by size order, from the largest on the left decreasing to the smallest on the right. This organization aligns with common visual packaging or organization logic of nesting dolls, confirming a typical arrangement from large to small.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface upon which the nesting dolls and shoe sit has distinct grain patterns typical of wood, depicted in a polished and rich tone. By combining world knowledge of furniture and material textures, it is reasonable to identify this as a sophisticated wooden table.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of the image subtle and non-distracting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a solid, muted backdrop with a taupe gray tone that does not compete for attention with the vibrant foreground elements. This subtle color choice lets the viewer focus on the main subjects (dolls and shoe) without being distracted, confirming the claim of the background being understated.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio, visual estimation can be made based on noticing the relative width and height. Image B appears horizontally extended, typical of the common 3:2 ratio used in photographic composition. The balance observed is consistent with this aspect ratio, and thus the answer adheres to common aspect practices in image design.",
