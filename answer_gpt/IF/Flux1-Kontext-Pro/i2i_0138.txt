    "Question": "Q1: Has the word 'Sharp' been added at the top left of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we can see the word 'Sharp' prominently placed near the top left area of the image. The word is clear and stylized in a way that mimics hand-drawn or sketched writing. This indicates that the word 'Sharp' has indeed been added to this location, as it is not commonly seen in images unless intentionally placed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Has the word 'Clean' been added at the bottom right of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the word 'Clean' at the bottom right, written in a matching style as 'Sharp', which has a sketch-like appearance. This placement suggests intentional addition, as natural objects and scenes generally don't contain such text without predefined purpose.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the words 'Sharp' and 'Clean' styled as a rough sketch?",
    "explanation": "Both words 'Sharp' and 'Clean' in Image B appear to have a sketched or hand-drawn quality, which distinguishes them from printed text. This sketch style is achieved through the uneven lines and shading, typical of pencil sketches.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image maintain a professional and relevant look for a hairdressing tools brand ad?",
    "explanation": "Image B transforms the photographic representation of scissors into a drawing while adding descriptive words like 'Sharp' and 'Clean,' which are desirable qualities in hairdressing tools. This sketched representation could appeal to an artistic audience and can still be considered professional, though it communicates slightly differently than a high-resolution photo might.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any elements added or altered in the image other than placing 'Sharp' and 'Clean' as specified in the instructions?",
    "explanation": "Upon comparing Image A and Image B, the latter has been altered to look like a pencil sketch of the scissors, and the words 'Sharp' and 'Clean' have been added. These changes were beyond just text addition, as the conversion to a sketched style was also a significant alteration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
