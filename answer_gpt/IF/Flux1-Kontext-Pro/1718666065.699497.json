        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane and tail exhibit a fine, detailed structure with wavy patterns, which visually resemble the intricate and fragile appearance of porcelain.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn’s horn has a reflective quality and displays a dark, spiral pattern that contrasts with the body, suggesting a metallic characteristic. This polished appearance aligns with what is expected of metallic spirals.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B consists of plain walls and a simple floor, typically found in a gallery setting. There is an absence of natural or forest elements, and the tones used are neutral, emphasizing the artwork without distraction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is positioned on a rectangular platform that exhibits a subtle texture characteristic of stone surfaces. This base differentiates itself from the smooth floor and adds to the sculptural display commonly seen in gallery setups.",
