    "Question": "Q1: Is the word 'Draft' written in a handwritten font?",
    "explanation": "The word 'Draft' appears to be in a cursive style, which is typically associated with handwriting. The letters flow together, suggesting a handwritten font rather than a standard printed typeface. Commonly, handwritten fonts mimic the natural flow of writing with a pen or pencil. Hence, based on the visual appearance of the letters, it can be concluded that it uses a handwritten font.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the word 'Draft' placed on the yellow paper?",
    "explanation": "The image exclusively shows a bright yellow background, with the word 'Draft' prominently centered. There are no indications of other surfaces or layers besides the yellow area, which resembles paper. Typically, when text is shown against a uniform colored background like this, it suggests it is part of the flat surface, such as printed on paper. Thus, the word 'Draft' is placed on the yellow paper.",
