      "question": "Are cogs and gears visibly integrated into the armature of the brass lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armature of the brass lamp has clear cog and gear mechanisms visible along the lamp arm, which are details commonly associated with steampunk aesthetics. The visible integration of these elements indicates a deliberate design to evoke an industrial or mechanical style. This visual cue, coupled with the world knowledge of design trends such as steampunk that frequently incorporate gears and cogs, leads to the conclusion that the lamp indeed features these elements.",

      "question": "Do the book's pages display mechanical schematic designs with cog-like margins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open book shows text on its pages rather than any mechanical designs or illustrations, and the margins don't feature cog-like patterns. This can be identified with the clear visibility of text lines that follow a standard book layout. Therefore, based on the visual information, the pages do not exhibit mechanical schematic designs, maintaining a traditional appearance.",

      "question": "Are rivet patterns present on the floral wallpaper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rivet patterns are not present on the floral wallpaper itself. Instead, the rivet pattern is visible on the frame around the entire image, which adds to the overall design structure, but not on the wallpaper. The floral design remains uninterrupted and consistent with classic wallpaper styles based on the visual cues.",

      "question": "Are the overall colors of the image dominated by warm tones such as brass, brown, and amber, consistent with a vintage leather-and-brass palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominance of brass tones from the lamp, brown from the wooden tabletop, and amber from the light beam creates a warm color scheme. This palette aligns with world knowledge of vintage aesthetics, often characterized by the use of such tones. The visual appeal harmonizes with the concept of vintage leather-and-brass elements due to the warm and muted nature of these colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lamp still casting a focused beam of light directly onto the open book, maintaining the original lighting setup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting setup remains consistent as the lamp casts a focused, warm light directly onto the open book on the tabletop. This beam of light is efficient in illuminating the book as intended, maintaining the functionality observed in Image A. The visual confirmation of the light's direction and intensity affirms the continued purpose of the lamp's focused beam.",
