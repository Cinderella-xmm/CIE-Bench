      "question": "Does the butterfly appear as a dynamic vortex of swirling cerulean and indigo energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is depicted amidst a backdrop that features swirling loops or trails of light in shades of cerulean. This gives the impression of movement and energy around the butterfly, akin to a vortex. The use of color and pattern contributes to this dynamic effect, creating an illusion of swirling energy around the butterfly, therefore reinforcing a sense of motion and energy.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is illustrated with glowing trails or wisps of light extending from its wings. These highlights add a spectral quality to the butterfly, indicating light or energy is being emitted, enhancing the visual impact and suggesting motion or ethereal presence.",

      "question": "Does the dark lower mass resemble a chasm of fractured, glossy obsidian?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower section beneath the butterfly appears fragmented and reflects light in a manner similar to obsidian, which is a dark, glassy volcanic rock. The depicted surface is irregular and seems to be composed of jagged, plate-like pieces, giving the impression of a chasm or a fissured surface, referring to the qualities of fractured, glossy obsidian.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark background, coupled with swirling light trails and the fractured surface, creates a sense of depth and otherworldliness, contributing to a mystical and nebulous atmosphere. The dim lighting, along with ethereal light effects, envelops the scene in a mysterious and enigmatic ambiance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is shown in the upper region of the image with space between it and the dark fissured surface below. It is centrally positioned and appears suspended in air over the mass, suggesting its position above the ground. This perspective gives the impression that the butterfly is hovering rather than resting on the surface.",
