    "Question": "Q2: Has the elephant been scaled down to a miniature size relative to the surrounding elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of multiple bonsai trees and a visible glass enclosure can suggest that the elephant is smaller than life-sized.

    "Question": "Q5: Is the scene surrounding the elephant filled with a dense, miniature jungle rendered in vibrant, earthy tones?",
    "explanation": "While Image B includes bonsai trees and a green landscape, it does not depict a 'dense, miniature jungle.'
