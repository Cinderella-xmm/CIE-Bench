      "question": "Is the woman's figure stylized in a cartoon-like manner with exaggerated proportions or simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's figure is stylized with aspects reminiscent of illustrative art, such as a more uniform texture and pose indicative of a painting rather than a photographed figure. This display does not fully transition into overly exaggerated proportions typical of cartoon styling but does lose some realistic detailing compared to Image A. Based on illustrative techniques, it aligns more closely with simplified features common in stylized images.",

      "question": "Are there visible gold embroidery details added to the red dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are noticeable gold embroidery details on the red dress which are not present in Image A. The embroidery appears as small, repetitive designs toward the hem in Image B which enhances the intricacy of the costume compared to the simple weave seen in the original. This signal points to an enhancement in detailing for a refined finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings significantly larger than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings are rendered with a similar scale as in Image A; they visually cover the same general width when aligned with the central figure. There is no evident increase in size based on the spatial distribution around the person's frame in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the butterfly wings feature detailed, intricate textures such as fine veins or layered patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings feature detailed representation of patterns suitable for illustrative art, including structured lines and textural effects. This intricacy contributes to a sense of depth and complexity in how the wings are depicted, akin to drawn art rather than photographic detail.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the names of all twelve months displayed on the butterfly wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase the names of all twelve months on the butterfly wings or elsewhere, judging by visible elements of the butterfly wing design and surrounding area which focus on pattern over text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an overall composition positioned within a wooden panel that features decorative elements integrated into the design such as floral patterns present on the borders, which are absent in the environmental scene depicted in Image A. This elevates Image B to a more frame-like appearance consistent with artistic presentations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the final image include design elements (such as wood grain, floral patterns, or embossed text) that suggest it is intended as a collectible item?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of a wooden frame with floral patterns and the painting render of the scene in Image B suggests an intention to present it as a collectible or decorative artifact. These artistic enhancements paired with illustrative styling bolster this interpretation, unlike Image A which maintains a candid outdoor appearance.",
