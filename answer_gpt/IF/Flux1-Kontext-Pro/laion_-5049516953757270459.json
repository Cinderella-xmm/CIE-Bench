    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire heart-shaped board composed solely of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped board appears smooth with realistic representations of fruits and vegetables, such as the texture of the avocado and the distinct look of strawberries. These elements suggest actual, realistic items rather than a construction made from LEGO bricks. Therefore, the board is not a LEGO mosaic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used to represent the food items colored appropriately to match the original produce (e.g., blue for blueberries, red for tomatoes)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B features realistic fruits and vegetables rather than LEGO bricks, there is no application of LEGO bricks and their colors to analyze.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are different LEGO brick sizes and shapes used to simulate textures (e.g., smooth bricks for avocado, small round bricks for berries, larger chunky bricks for broccoli)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual assessment of Image B shows realistic textures, such as the smooth surface of the avocado and natural forms of other produce items, rather than textures simulated by LEGO shapes and sizes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all food items in the LEGO mosaic have clearly defined and distinct borders separating them from adjacent items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food items appear realistic with seamlessly integrated boundaries common to natural food presentations. There are no pixelated borders typical of a LEGO mosaic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the LEGO mosaic remain a perfect heart, matching the original boardâ€™s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of the board in Image B retains a perfect heart silhouette. However, since it is a realistic arrangement of food on a wooden board and not a LEGO mosaic, it retains the original form rather than a constructed shape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the LEGO mosaic placed on a solid, neutral gray base with no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop of Image B is a solid, neutral gray with no visible patterns or textures, indicating that the board is placed on such a background. However, the board itself is not a LEGO mosaic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO mosaic exhibit a clear pixelated, blocky appearance consistent with a LEGO construction, rather than a smooth or realistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts smooth, realistic renderings of foods, characteristic of photographs of real objects, rather than a pixelated, blocky appearance indicative of LEGO constructions.",
