      "question": "Does the edited image contain multiple distinct postcard-style panels depicting the woman in different dynamic poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of four separate panels creates a collage-like appearance often associated with postcards, each featuring the same woman in various poses: walking, glancing about, and standing at a window. The panels' distinct scenes and dynamic compositions suggest the depiction of different moments in a narrative, typical of postcard designs that capture multiple perspectives or events.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red dress and black leather jacket outlined with bold, thick lines and rendered in highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman’s clothing with strong, well-defined outlines, and the colors of the dress and jacket are vibrant and intense. These visual elements are characteristic of illustrations where bold outlines and high saturation are used to create striking, stylized images that stand out and capture attention.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there at least three different dynamic poses shown—such as walking, looking at neon signs, and browsing shop windows—in the postcard series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B comprises four panels showing the woman in distinct poses: two walking poses within a neon-lit street, one glancing to the side, and another standing by a shop window looking outside. Each pose involves a different action or viewpoint, emphasizing the woman’s interaction with her environment and narrative movement.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire set of postcards presented within a black slipcase that has a silver foil embossed cityscape design on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The visible setup of Image B shows four panels presented on a flat surface, but there is no indication of a black slipcase surrounding them. There are no silver foil cityscape designs visible in the arrangement, suggesting the postcards are displayed as is without any additional packaging or embellishment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B features bordered panels that resemble comic book layouts. However, there are no visible speech bubbles or motion lines, which are typical comic elements that convey dialogue or movement. The image focuses on scene presentation rather than textual or dynamic indications common in comic books.",
