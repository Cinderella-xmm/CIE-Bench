      "question": "Does the chibi tech mascot incorporate the phone's original design elements and color scheme?",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi tech mascot and accessories share the same color scheme as the phone, which is a muted tone, likely rose gold or a similar hue. This consistent color palette confirms the phone's design elements are incorporated in the chibi mascot.
