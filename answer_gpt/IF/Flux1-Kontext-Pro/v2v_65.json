        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear visual indication that the scene, featuring a character, is contained within a clear spherical object placed on a pedestal, which resembles a snow globe. Typically, a snow globe is defined by a transparent enclosure containing a scene submerged in water with floating particles that mimic snow, which is evident through the depiction in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe resting on a solid base that resembles stone. Additionally, to the left side of the image, there is a translucent surface with frost patterns, typical of a window during snowy conditions, indicating the presence of a frosty window.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, through the frosty window, distant peaks covered with snow are visible, which align with the characteristics of a snowy mountain range. This observation matches the description of a mountainous backdrop blanketed with snow.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the globe in Image B, the character appears significantly different from a realistic depiction. The proportions are exaggerated with a larger head, and shorter limbs, aligning with the typical characteristics of a 'chibi' style, which is often used to create a cute or stylized representation. Chibi characters usually exhibit these distinguishing features, supporting the transformation claim.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surrounding the character within the snow globe, there are small-scale, conifer-like shapes and small peaks which resemble trees and mountains. These elements are downsized and stylized, fitting well within the context of a decorative snow globe scene.",
