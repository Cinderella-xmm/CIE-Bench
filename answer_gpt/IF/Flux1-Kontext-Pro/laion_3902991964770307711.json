      "question": "Are the three top portions of the candelabra replaced with transparent, tapered glass perfume caps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra appear to be designed as transparent, tapered glass pieces that resemble the caps of perfume bottles. This is a change from the original in Image A, where the top portions are solid metal with no transparency. The visual cue here is the transparency and shape, which is indicative of glass perfume caps.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candelabra in Image B features curved arms that appear to have a gold finish, providing a seamless and sleek appearance compared to Image A where the arms are silver.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the base of the object does not have any visible brand logo or marking. The surface remains uniformly smooth. In contrast, a logo might have been present, but from the visuals in Image B, no such element can be confirmed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the surface has decorative elements like the ornate detailing on the base and arms, there are no intricate floral engravings distinctly visible. The visual impression is of polished metal without distinct floral patterns as might be expected from such engravings.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a script font label elegantly engraved on the central tube of the candelabra, evident from the visual cues of the text's style and positioning. This is a change from Image A, where no such label is present.",
