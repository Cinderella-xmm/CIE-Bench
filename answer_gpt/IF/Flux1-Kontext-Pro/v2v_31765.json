      "question": "Have the vegetables and knife been broken down into geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables and knife are depicted using distinct geometric shapes like cubes and semi-circles. The carrots, celery, and onions appear as collections of cube-like shapes, while the knife maintains a recognizable blade shape but is also simplified into more basic forms. Such geometric abstraction is more aligned with art styles that break objects into fundamental forms, suggesting that they indeed have been broken down into geometric shapes.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each vegetable type maintains a cohesive group of shapes, with no rearrangement beyond maintaining the original pattern of placement, indicating that while the objects are simplified, they are not rearranged abstractly. Therefore, the geometric shapes are not arranged in a new abstract manner apart from simplification.",

      "question": "Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the abstract and geometric representation in Image B, the shapes are distinct enough to recognize them as diced carrots, celery pieces, and onion cubes. The knife retains its overall recognizable shape. This suggests that the abstraction is not extremely exaggerated to the point of non-recognition.",

      "question": "Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a variety of colors similar to its real-life counterparts, with bright greens, oranges, and whites indicating celery, carrots, and onions, and the cutting board maintains a natural wood tone. Thus, the color palette does not seem simplified in a way typical of Cubist work, which is known for using more muted and limited colors.",

      "question": "Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects retain their single perspective with no indications of being viewed from multiple angles or overlapping in a manner typical of Cubism. The objects remain distinct, and there is no evident attempt to show multiple perspectives simultaneously within a single plane.",
