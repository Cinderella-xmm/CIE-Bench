      "question": "Is the title \"A Capybara’s Sydney Escape\" displayed prominently on the image, arching above the Opera House?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title present is 'A Capybara's Sydney' and is prominently displayed, arching above the capybara rather than directly above the Opera House. The words 'Sydney Escape' do not appear in the title as the question suggests. The title is curved across the top of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image combine photorealistic rendering of the capybara and environment with illustrated or stylized elements (e.g., exaggerated features, cartoon-like details)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara and environment are illustrated in a stylized manner with vibrant colors and illustrative features, such as cartoon-like eyes and a bright, playful presentation. It lacks the photorealistic rendering seen in traditional photographs, opting instead for an exaggerated and painterly style. Such characteristics are evident in the simplified and brightened colors as well as the outlined features that are common in illustrations or cartoons.",

      "question": "Is there a bold, playful font used for the title, and is it arched above the Sydney Opera House?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bold and playful font is indeed used for the title 'A Capybara's Sydney,' and it is arched or curved at the top of the image. However, the arch is located above the capybara, not directly above the Sydney Opera House itself. The playful nature of the font is evident in its large size and curving around the upper part of the image.",

      "question": "Are the blues in the capybara's beanie and the beverage visibly more vivid and saturated compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the colors appear more subdued and realistic, typical of a photograph during sunset with softer, warmer hues. In Image B, the blues in the capybara's beanie and the color of the beverage are more vivid and saturated. This is evidenced by the bright, cartoon-like presentation in Image B which opts for a more eye-catching and vibrant palette. Such saturation is commonly seen in illustrations to attract attention and is visible through the more intense shade of blue.",

      "question": "Are there cartoonish beach-themed stickers visible on the capybara’s blue beanie?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara’s blue beanie features cartoonish, star-like decorations instead of typical beach-themed stickers. These small decorative elements may resemble beach-related art, but they specifically appear as stars scattered over the beanie. This playful component fits the overall stylized and illustrated theme of Image B.",

      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House clearly visible in the background, maintaining its recognizable shape and position relative to the water and sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House is clearly visible in the background, maintaining its iconic shape with sails that are easily identifiable. It is positioned relative to the water inlet, with the sky visible in the background, consistent with how it is typically viewed from that vantage point. The distinctive shape of the Opera House allows it to be recognized despite artistic interpretations.",

      "question": "Is the capybara still holding the orange-colored beverage with a straw and garnish, facing toward the Opera House?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara is indeed holding an orange-colored beverage with a straw and garnish. The position and inclination suggest it is facing toward the reader, with the Opera House positioned in the background. The depiction of the capybara holding the drink retains this feature of the original scenario and keeps the pose of enjoying a beverage while ostensibly appreciating the iconic landmark.",
