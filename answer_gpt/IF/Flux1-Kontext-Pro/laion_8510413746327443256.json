      "question": "Does the edited image show the smartwatch transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon with dragon-like anatomy integrated into the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On analysis of Image B, the smartwatch retains its basic shape and structure but includes decorative elements suggestive of a dragon theme, such as a dragon graphic on the watch face. The device itself is not transformed into a full cybernetic dragon with functional anatomy integration into the wrist. Hence, combining the smartwatch's unchanged structure with the decorative modifications, the answer is more focused on embellishment rather than transformation.",

      "question": "Is the watch face replaced with a radiant, multi-layered holographic dragon eye featuring glowing elements and depth effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a watch face featuring a detailed dragon graphic with glowing elements, likely indicating a layered, radiant effect. This does resemble a holographic style, focusing on the dragon theme and the inclusion of glowing elements contributes to a depth effect. The use of luminous colors suggests a more dynamic display aligning with holographic characteristics.",

      "question": "Are the original silicone band and its contours replaced with a series of interlocking, metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image A, it features a silicone band with smooth contours typical in smartwatch design. However, Image B depicts a band that mimics metallic characteristics and structure akin to scales, offering a robotic, interlocking aesthetic. This strongly contrasts with the original silicone material and design, reflecting a transformation from flexible silicone to rigid metallic scales.",

      "question": "Has the digital crown been replaced with a glowing, spherical neural node emitting light or energy pulses, resembling a biotech interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis, the digital crown in Image B retains its fundamental shape, having added lighting and design elements suggestive of technological advancement. Although it emits light, its shape remains reminiscent of a traditional crown rather than transforming into a neural node or similar device. The assessment considers the visible crown, which integrates additional features without fundamentally altering its form.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original app icons on the watch face replaced with glowing, rune-like control sigils that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A features typical smartwatch icons representing functional applications. In contrast, Image B replaces these with symbols that radiate light, adopting a tech-magic aesthetic. The dragon theme in combination with glowing symbols aligns visually with the concept of modernistic or magical control interfaces.",

      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic form with visual cues such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays static design elements predominantly characterized by lighting effects without explicit motion cues that suggest energy flow or movement. While it incorporates dynamic lighting and thematic graphics, it lacks visual indicators such as motion lines or active posture typical in conveying literal movement or life.",
