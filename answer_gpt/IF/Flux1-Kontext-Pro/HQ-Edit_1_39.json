      "question": "Is the cactus transformed into a creature-like form with distinct features such as a face, body, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a transformation where the cactus now exhibits creature-like characteristics. It has a defined face with eyes, a body with limbs (including arms and a tail), and is wearing a sombrero. This indicates a clear evolution from a simple plant to a living entity with distinct anatomical features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the creature’s scales feature patterns and colors matching those on the sombrero’s brim, such as floral and geometric designs in vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By closely examining the creature in Image B, it displays scales with a green color that complements the sombrero but does not directly feature patterns similar to those on the brim, like floral or geometric designs. The sombrero itself has these colorful patterns, but the scales do not.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the terracotta pot been replaced with a stone-like base that serves as the creature’s feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature stands on a stone-like base rather than within a terracotta pot as seen in Image A. This stone base appears to be more of a platform for the creature, as it has its own feet distinctly separate from the base, showing a transformation from being potted to having limbs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spines replaced with golden, shimmering quills that appear reflective or luminous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is covered in spines that maintain a natural cactus-like appearance and do not appear golden, reflective, or luminous. They are more in line with standard green cactus spines than any transformed or enhanced version.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {

      "question": "Is there a visible, flowing sandy aura surrounding the creature, composed of particle-like textures resembling drifting sand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B does indeed feature a sandy environment, and there are wispy, flowing elements that resemble a sandy aura around the creature. This creates an impression of drifting sand or a windy desert ambiance surrounding the creature.",

    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's eyes are depicted as luminous, gem-like orbs, emitting a warm topaz color. They have reflective highlights that contribute to a watchful and serene expression, aligning with the description provided.",
