      "question": "Does the edited shirt design use vibrant, saturated colors typical of pop art rather than subdued or earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt features bright and intense colors such as electric blue and hot pink, which are highly saturated. These types of colors are characteristic of pop art, which often uses bold and vibrant color schemes to create a striking visual impact. These colors contrast with more subdued or earthy tones, which are typically softer or muted. The use of such vibrant hues in Image B fits the aesthetic style of pop art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are large, solid-colored sections used to define the muscular figureâ€™s anatomy, such as chest, arms, and legs, replacing fine shading or gradient effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muscular figure's body parts, such as the chest, arms, and legs, are filled with solid colors, which is a departure from traditional shading techniques that use gradients or fine lines to convey depth. This technique of using large blocks of color emphasizes the figure's form in a bold and straightforward manner, typical of graphic and flat color styles.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the edges of the figure and surrounding elements consist of crisp, angular, or straight lines rather than flowing or organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lines defining the figure and elements in Image B are outlined clearly and sharply, with distinct edges that appear more angular. In contrast, flowing or organic curves would have gentle arcs and a smoother appearance. The use of structured lines gives the design a more geometric feel, enhancing the energetic and modern style of the shirt.",

      "question": "Are the previously subtle or gold-toned patterns now rendered in bright, glowing neon colors such as electric blue, hot pink, or lime green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A to Image B, the gold-toned lines and subtle patterns seen in the original design have been transformed into luminescent neon colors such as electric blue and hot pink in the edited image. These neon colors are bright and glowing, typical of contemporary and pop cultural aesthetics, offering a vibrant contrast to the original tones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there recurring, stylized patterns (such as stars, waves, or dots) repeated across the shirt in a consistent and energetic manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt displays various stylized patterns such as decorative lines and shapes, possibly resembling stars or waves. These elements are laid out in a systematic and dynamic arrangement, typical of energetic and repeating motifs, contributing to an overall sense of movement and vitality in the design.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the central figure still clearly identifiable as a muscular male figure in a dynamic pose, with arms raised and body angled, even after the stylistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the changes in design style, in Image B the central figure retains its identity as a muscular male in a dynamic pose. The outline and posture remain similar to Image A, with discernible features such as the outlined muscles and angled limbs. The pose, with arms raised, is prominent and maintained, clearly conveying the intended dynamic action.",
