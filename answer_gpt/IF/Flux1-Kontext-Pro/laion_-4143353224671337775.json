      "question": "Is the entire ceramic form now constructed from interlocking puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic form has a surface that appears continuous and is smoothly aligned, giving no indication that it is constructed from interlocking puzzle pieces. The texture and coloration suggest a singular form rather than one made of multiple elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ceramic form with a primarily beige color, with some green and brown accents, but it does not clearly depict any puzzle pieces in distinct colors, particularly not beige and brown interlocking pieces.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the ceramic in Image B appears smooth and continuous, indicating that if there were any edges or gaps, they are not visible and are seamlessly integrated into the form, maintaining a continuous appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the ceramic in Image B is a smooth green area, suggesting it might mimic the appearance of a puzzle piece but more likely is just a part of the form without any interlocking features.",
