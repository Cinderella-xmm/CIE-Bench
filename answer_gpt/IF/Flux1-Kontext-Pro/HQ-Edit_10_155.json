      "question": "Is the ornate lantern enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show the ornate lantern clearly enclosed within a transparent glass dome. The glass dome encases the lantern, smoothly coverting the scene underneath without any visual obstructions. This suggests that the lantern is indeed within the dome. Common knowledge about glass domes being used for encasement or protection reinforces this observation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the original tile designs been replaced with scaled-down, vibrant ceramic street pavements forming a ground surface beneath the lantern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground surface beneath the lantern is made up of scaled-down ceramic tiles, which appear as colorful pavements typically seen in street settings. This is a contrast to Image A, where the lantern is placed on a tiled table rather than a street-like surface. Common knowledge about ceramic pavements informs us of their use in marketplaces or urban settings.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small textile merchants with colorful fabric canopies positioned around the base of the lantern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible miniature figures resembling textile merchants around the lantern base. These figures are accompanied by small, colorful canopies, suggestive of market stalls. Such elements are consistent with small-scale markets commonly found in areas like medinas or marketplaces.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there tiny palm trees integrated into the scene around the base of the lantern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, small palm trees are integrated into the base scene around the lantern. The appearance of these miniature trees suggests an exotic or warm climate scene, where palms are generally found. This contrasts with Image A, where no such vegetation is visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the glass dome feature a weathered, rustic town square surface with aged textures and irregular patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the base of the glass dome as having a textured surface, resembling an aged town square with rustic features. The surface appears to be tiled with irregular and possibly worn-looking patterns, which contrasts with the pristine geometric patterns in Image A. Knowledge about rustic town squares informs this observation of dated aesthetics typically linked to historical areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire scene composed of a coherent miniature medina environment with all specified elements (glass dome, ceramic pavements, merchants, palm trees, rustic base) arranged to create an exotic and charming atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combined elements in Image B—including the glass dome, ceramic pavements, miniature merchants with their canopies, small palm trees, and the rustic base—create a unified scene reminiscent of a miniature medina or marketplace. The arrangement and choice of components contribute to forming an exotic and charming environment akin to those found in historical or culturally significant urban settings.",
