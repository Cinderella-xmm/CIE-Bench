      "question": "Has the fabric of the Victorian attire been dissolved into cosmic dust?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire retains its fabric form, showing no signs of dissolution into cosmic dust. The visual cues suggest a solid fabric that maintains its distinct Victorian style. The background features cosmic elements, but they do not interact with the attire. Therefore, the fabric remains intact, and my analysis concludes there has been no dissolution into cosmic dust.",

      "question": "Does the brass scientific instrument exhibit intricate, clockwork tendrils growing from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass scientific instrument appears to have clockwork tendrils emanating from it. These tendrils appear complex and mechanical, suggesting a growth or extension that is reminiscent of intricate clockwork structures. The visual cues clearly indicate their presence, thus confirming the exhibition of clockwork tendrils.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clockwork tendrils softly grasping the monkey's subtly distorted hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tendrils in proximity to the monkey's hands, creating an interaction between them. The tendrils give the impression of touching or 'softly grasping' the hands, which appear somewhat distorted just by the arrangement and positioning. This interaction confirms the presence of tendrils grasping the hands.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image evoke a profound, dreamlike state characteristic of Surrealism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a surreal atmosphere created by the cosmic background, monkey dressed in Victorian clothing, and the mysterious clockwork tendrils interacting with the monkey. These elements harmonize into a fantastical and dreamlike composition, embodying the essence of Surrealism, which often features unexpected and imaginative scenes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images maintain a similar composition, with a monkey in Victorian attire positioned next to the brass scientific instrument. The overall layout, where the subject and the instrument are staged, remains consistent between Image A and Image B despite the surreal additions in the latter.",
