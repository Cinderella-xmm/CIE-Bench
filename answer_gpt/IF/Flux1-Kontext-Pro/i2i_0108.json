      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown with a full body, not just a half-body figure. The visual cues indicate that the character's lower body, including legs and feet, is fully visible as it stands on the edge of the television. This suggests that the character is depicted in full, not as a half-body figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the character appears to be stepping out from the TV screen, with one foot on the TV stand and part of the character's body extending beyond the frame of the TV. This visual effect gives the impression of the character emerging from the screen.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted holding a shield in front, which resembles a defensive posture. The shield is typically associated with defense, and the position suggests readiness to block an attack, hence a defensive stance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image simulate an augmented reality display effect through lighting, shadows, and spatial realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses lighting and shadows to create a realistic effect, where the character seems to be part of the room despite being partially still in the TV. The spatial alignment and the way it extends from the TV screen contribute to an augmented reality-like experience.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the character's original appearance and posture been maintained while implementing the new effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing with Image A, the character's costume, shield position, and physics remain consistent in Image B, indicating that the original appearance and posture have been preserved. The added effects are integrated without altering these elements.",
