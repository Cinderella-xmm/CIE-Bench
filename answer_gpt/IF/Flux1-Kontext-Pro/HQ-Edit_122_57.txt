    "Question": "Q2: Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative panels visible on the clear crystal vase are etched with abstract floral patterns.

    "Question": "Q3: Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are pastel-colored, translucent, and appear to be intricately carved out of crystal.
