      "question": "Is the front view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three-view combination of the car includes two images that display the front view clearly. Both images show the car's front grille, headlights, and frontal design details, making the front view clear and prominent. Therefore, based on these observations, it can be concluded that the front view is clearly visible.",

      "question": "Is the left side view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the left side view of the car does not appear to be clearly visible. The views presented show two front views and a partial side view that seems angled between the front and side, but it doesn't clearly show the left side specifically. Therefore, this angle doesn't sufficiently highlight or specifically present the left side profile of the car.",

      "question": "Is the rear view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom right quadrant presents a view of the car from the rear side. This includes visible details such as the rear lights and the rear bumper. Given this information, it is evident that the rear view of the car is clearly visible in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the three views of the car presented in a non-overlapping manner, ensuring they are distinct and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three views of the car are laid out in a grid with each image occupying separate spaces. The arrangement avoids overlap; each view (two showing the front and one the rear) is distinct, ensuring clarity in presentation. Therefore, the images are presented in a non-overlapping and distinct manner.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall presentation of the combined three-view image align with the standards suitable for car magazines or showroom flyers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For car magazines or showroom flyers, images should clearly present the car from different perspectives to highlight design elements. In Image B, despite two views with a similar front angle, the rear view complements them, enabling a reasonable showcase of the car. Yet, the lack of a full profile or side view and differing angle would typically result in greater alignment with standard professional car presentation. However, the distinct layout and clear visibility provide a practical, albeit slightly limited, magazine-style arrangement.",
