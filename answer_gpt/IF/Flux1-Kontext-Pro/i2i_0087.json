      "question": "Does the clock appear to protrude from the wall surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock appears to have depth and protrudes from the wall. This is inferred from the shadows and lighting effects around the clock, which create a three-dimensional look and suggest the clock is hanging, not flush with the wall. This visual cue is in line with common representations of wall clocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the clock cast a realistic shadow on the wall behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible shadow below the clock that resembles realistic shadows cast by objects with depth. This shadow suggests a light source and confirms the three-dimensional protrusion of the clock from the wall, as typical shadows do when an object is elevated and illuminated. Based on this visual information and common knowledge about shadows, the answer is clear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the edges of the clock been modified to indicate it is not flush against the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the clock in Image B, accompanied by shadowing, suggest that the clock is protruding from the wall. The shadow further emphasizes the discrepancy between the clock's edges and the wall surface, reinforcing the perception that it has depth. Common design cues and light-shadow interplay indicate that it is not flush.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there evidence of lighting changes around the clock to enhance its three-dimensional look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be purposefully adjusted to create shadows and highlights on the clock's frame. This lighting setup enhances the three-dimensional effect, making the clock appear more pronounced against the flat surface behind it. Such lighting modifications are commonly used in photography and design to enhance depth.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the clock maintained a completely flat appearance, or does it now show signs of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No\n```",
      "explanation": "Image B shows signs of depth for the clock. The shadow cast by the clock and the lighting effects all contribute to a more three-dimensional appearance, indicating it has a protruding structure. This aligns with general perception of objects designed to look three-dimensional, as they typically involve depth and shadow effects.",
