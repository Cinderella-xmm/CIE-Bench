      "question": "Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair does not appear to be constructed from visible LEGO-style bricks. The surfaces of the chair, such as the backrest, seat, and other components, are smooth and don't exhibit the distinct texture or interlocking design characteristic of LEGO bricks. Typically, LEGO constructions have visible studs and brick patterns, which are not apparent here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chair's seat and backrest cushions as sleek, smooth, and glossy black surfaces. However, they do not resemble LEGO bricks. LEGO bricks are more angular with distinct edges and typically have visible stud patterns, which do not appear on these cushions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests and the base of the chair are indeed rendered in a silver color. This is visually evident from the metallic shine and hue reflected on these parts, indicating a silver coloration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B appear to be a solid gray color rather than translucent. They do not show characteristics of translucency, like light passing through or a lighter shade indicative of transparency. They are a consistent solid gray without any clear visual translucency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the seat and backrest have smooth, flat surface layers without any visible layered bricks or gradients. There is a distinct texture difference between known LEGO bricks, which are stackable with visible edges, and the seamless, sleek appearance of these cushions. There are no gradients or visible brick layers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests in Image B appear more like a single fluid piece with a simple design and smooth curves, but they are not hinged parts. There is no visible hardware or sections suggesting they are hinged or designed in a mechanical fashion; they are consistently smooth and continuous without evident padding or intricate curves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is placed against what appears to be a plain white backdrop as a tabletop, based on the clean and uniformly light surface visible at the base of the chair. While lacking edges or additional props that might categorize it definitively as a 'tabletop,' it appears to be positioned on a flat white surface typical of studio or display settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly highlight a geometric, modular construction characterized by visible brick edges; instead, it emphasizes smooth surfaces and clean lines without any visible signs of modular construction, such as interlocking parts or distinct edges typical of bricks. The overall shape and design are fluid without indications of being segmented by brick edges.",
