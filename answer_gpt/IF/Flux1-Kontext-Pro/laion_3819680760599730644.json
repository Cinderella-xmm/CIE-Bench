        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens of the camera appears to be drawn in a way that could be interpreted as an anthropomorphic feature such as eyes. The circular shape and highlights of the lens resemble eyes, which is a common visual technique to give inanimate objects a lively, character-like appearance. Using world knowledge, we know this is often done in illustrations and animations to portray emotion and personality. Therefore, the lens has been stylized to represent expressive eyes.",
