      "question": "Are the buildings in the skyline rendered with pixel-patterned or grid-like luminous facades resembling a digital display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings appear to have added digital effects, characterized by luminous facades suggesting digital technology or a futuristic appearance. However, the facades are relatively smooth with vibrant lighting rather than pixel-patterned or grid-like structures explicitly resembling a digital display. The main focus is on the glowing edges and elements, not on a grid-like texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings exhibit a glowing or luminescent effect, such as bright edges, internal illumination, or radiant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings clearly display a glowing or luminescent effect. They have bright edges and are embedded with radiant colors, which make them look as though they are internally illuminated or have an aura of light surrounding them, giving a luminous quality that is not present in the original image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the trees been replaced with glowing, angular, circuit-like structures composed of lines and nodes resembling digital pathways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees appear to have been enhanced with a glowing effect, predominantly in blue tones, creating a luminescent appearance. However, they do not feature angular, circuit-like structures with lines and nodes. Instead, they maintain their natural shape but with added glowing effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bridge illuminated with vibrant neon lights along its structure, creating a glowing pathway effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridge in Image B is enhanced with vibrant neon lights along its structure, giving it a glowing pathway effect. These neon lights create a clear contrast with the surrounding darker areas, emphasizing the bridge in the edited scene with a futuristic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene consistently feature futuristic technology aesthetics, such as digital patterns, glowing elements, and cybernetic design features across buildings, trees, and infrastructure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consistently applies a futuristic and cybernetic aesthetic throughout the scene. The buildings, trees, and bridge are all enhanced with glowing elements and a bright color palette. This consistent application of neon and luminescent effects gives the entire image a technology-driven, futuristic ambience, although not all elements are explicitly digital or cybernetic.",
