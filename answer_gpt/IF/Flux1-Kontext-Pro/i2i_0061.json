      "question": "Does the entire photo exhibit a bright and soft watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky, grass, and shirt exhibit soft, flowing colors akin to watercolor. The blending and outlines are not as sharp or hard as a photograph, suggesting a watercolor effect. This is a distinct characteristic in artistic editing, like transformation into watercolor paintings, and it's visible across the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the ground depicted using semi-abstract brushstrokes with slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground and its elements like grass have indistinct edges and areas of blended color typical of semi-abstract painting techniques. While distinct elements exist, the overall appearance is softer and slightly blurred, consistent with semi-abstract brushwork.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background buildings rendered with semi-abstract brushstrokes and slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings in the background have less definition and softer colors compared to a realistic portrayal, characteristic of semi-abstract artwork. The use of brushstrokes and color blending gives them a slightly blurred effect, suggesting semi-abstract rendering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents uniform brightness and softness in color treatment across various elements like the sky, ground, and buildings, indicating a consistent aesthetic. The colors are gently blended, and the overall style is bright and soothing, which usually represents a deliberate artistic choice.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The position and posture of the character in Image B closely match Image A. The key aspects of stance, arm position, and leg placement remain unchanged, indicating that the editing focused on style rather than compositional adjustments.",
