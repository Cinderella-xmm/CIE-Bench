    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image now an educational infographic with a clear title \"Currencies of the World\" displayed at the top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features a bold, clear title 'Currencies of the World' at the top, indicating the intended use of this image as an educational infographic about world currencies. This provides context for the content below.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the design use a clean, modern aesthetic with minimal visual clutter and balanced layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B uses a simple line drawing of a wallet with currencies and accompanying charts. There is minimal color usage and no additional decorative elements, emphasizing a clean and modern aesthetic which is common in infographics for clarity.",

      "question": "Are there distinct labeled sections titled “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” corresponding to the visible banknotes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are sections labeled 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR' alongside the graphs at the bottom, but these don't directly correspond to particular visible banknotes in the line drawing in the wallet. This suggests the provided labels associate with the graphs rather than specific banknotes.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather wallet from Image A has been transformed into a blueprint-style drawing. This is characterized by clean line work and a schematic-like representation, which is consistent with a minimalist approach for emphasis on information rather than style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show annotations next to each currency within the wallet blueprint. The drawing merely includes currency designs without direct annotations or identification, focusing more on the aesthetic structure of an infographic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes graphs below the wallet blueprint design. These graphs appear to display data relevant to the economy likely related to currency, given the context of the title 'Currencies of the World.' The presence of lines titled with labels like USD suggests exchange rate data or economic trends.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no specific icons representing the economies of USA, Qatar, or India are present. The image focuses on currency, graphs, and the infographic style without using distinctive icons for representing national economies.",
