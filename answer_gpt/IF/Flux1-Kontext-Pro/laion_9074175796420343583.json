      "question": "Is the pie depicted with human-like features such as a face and limbs, resembling a fussy old librarian?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the pie with no human-like features. The human-like appearance is portrayed by the character holding the pie rather than the pie itself. This character, though blurred, shows attributes such as limbs and clothing – indicating a human representation, but the pie itself lacks these features.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the pie with a lattice crust pattern transformed into an apron draped over its lower half. Instead, the apron is worn by the character. The pie is separated from the character's attire, which includes a typical apron with no apparent lattice design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows Scene 2 with the text “You’ll get a slice of silence!”, but there is no feather pen depicted. Instead, a knife is used, held by the character, not positioned above the pie.",
