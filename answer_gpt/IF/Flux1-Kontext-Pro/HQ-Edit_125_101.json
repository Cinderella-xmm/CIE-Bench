      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly contained within a transparent spherical boundary, which is characteristic of a snow globe. The spherical enclosure is visible, and it encloses one dancer figure and several landmarks, conveying the appearance and function of a snow globe.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe that replicates the leaping pose of the original dancer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a 3D figure inside the snow globe that appears to replicate the pose of a dancer, similar to the leaping pose of the original dancer in Image A. The figure within the snow globe mimics the dynamic position seen in the previous image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and at least two other recognizable miniature Parisian landmarks present inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature representation of the Eiffel Tower along with other small-scale architectural landmarks inside the snow globe. The scene includes approximately three buildings, which could represent Parisian landmarks. The presence of multiple miniature structures and the Eiffel Tower aligns with the representation of Paris scenery.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible swirling snowflakes surrounding the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains visible white specks inside the spherical boundary. These specks resemble swirling snowflakes, which are commonly found in snow globes to simulate a snowstorm effect. Thus, the presence of these swirling specks around landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower suggests snowflakes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the snow globe resting on a base made of bronze and glass, with visible engravings in French script?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a snow globe positioned on a base that appears to have a bronzed appearance with intricate designs. However, the engravings are decorative patterns rather than any visible script, which means that no French script is visible. The base is visually distinct but lacks identifiable script markings.",
