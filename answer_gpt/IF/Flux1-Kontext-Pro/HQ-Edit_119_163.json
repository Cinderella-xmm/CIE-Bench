      "question": "Has the body of the teapot been transformed into a sleek cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a canister with a sleek cylindrical shape, unlike a teapot. The object in Image B is not a teapot, indicating the transformation from the initial teapot shape in Image A to a different cylindrical shape in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dragon engravings still present and visibly detailed on the body of the canister?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canister prominently displays dragon engravings along with intricate detailing. Observing these visible designs and comparing the presence of similar engravings on the original teapot in Image A corroborates that the engravings remain detailed on the canister body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the original hinged lid been replaced with a metallic screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a rounded metallic lid on the canister, which resembles a screw cap without any visible hinge. Comparing this with the teapot lid featuring a handle in Image A leads to confirming the replacement with a screw cap style lid in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are intricate tea leaf patterns embossed around the circumference of the screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals detailed embossing on the canister's lid that resembles patterns potentially related to tea leaves. The analysis needs to consider the absence of such detailing on the cap in the original image of teapot, this reinforces the presence of intricate embossing around the cap circumference in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" visibly inscribed along the length of the spout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the inscription 'Dragon's Delight' on the body of the cylindrical canister rather than on any spout, as a canister does not have a spout. Comparing this aspect with the spout on the teapot in Image A recognizes that the inscription is placed on the canister body rather than along a spout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a minimalist tea leaf logo located on the top center of the screw cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there appears to be no minimalist tea leaf logo on the top center of the lid, which features ornate designs. Similarly, there is no logo visible on the teapot handle in Image A, confirming the absence of such a logo in Image B.",
