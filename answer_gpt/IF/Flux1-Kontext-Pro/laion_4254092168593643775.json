    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall image framed or designed to resemble a product label with defined edges and layout consistent with a beverage packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a can with artwork on its surface, which is typical for a product label on beverage packaging. The design is complete with bold typography and graphics that wrap around the can, suggesting it is intended as a beverage product label.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible, stylized streaks of sand in the background that convey motion and act as graphic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains colorful and abstract graphic elements that resemble speed lines more than sand. These lines are consistent with typical design elements used to convey motion and energy on packaging. However, they don't particularly resemble sand.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the motocross rider depicted as a simplified, high-contrast silhouette with minimal detail, emphasizing form over texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider is illustrated rather than photographed, with black, high-contrast lines and blocks of color resembling a graphic rather than a detailed photograph. This conveys more of a stylized form-focused depiction consistent with poster art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'RaceFuel' is prominently featured in large, bold typography on the can in Image B. It is a key feature of the label design, intended to draw attention.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no track outline overlayed with vivid colors. The design focuses more on abstract graphics and typography rather than a detailed track outline.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Yes, Image B includes a speedometer icon at the bottom. It shows a needle pointing towards the upper end of the gauge, implying speed, which fits with the theme of energy drinks often being associated with speed and energy boosts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the combined visual elements—silhouette, streaks, typography, track, and speedometer—collectively communicate a narrative of power and speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "explanation": "Image B's combination of a dynamic illustration of a rider, speed lines, bold typography 'RaceFuel', and a speedometer icon create a cohesive message conveying power and speed. Although a detailed track is not used, the elements present still strongly suggest a narrative of energy and motion.",
