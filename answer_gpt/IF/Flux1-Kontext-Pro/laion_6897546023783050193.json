      "question": "Does the image exhibit characteristics of ukiyo-e art such as flat color areas, strong outlines, and stylized forms instead of realistic 3D rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays characteristics typical of ukiyo-e art through its flat color use, strong outlining, and highly stylized rendering. The form of the robe and clouds is simplified and flattened into stylized patterns, with areas of flat colors rather than attempts at realistic 3D shading. This stylization is a hallmark of ukiyo-e art, which often emphasizes decorative and planar qualities over depth.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the robes flattened into a two-dimensional, flowing pattern with visible indigo and gold coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the robes appear as two-dimensional patterns, characterized by flowing indigo coloring with gold details. This use of bold color and pattern enhances the overall flattened decorative quality akin to traditional Japanese prints, where detail is presented in pattern and hue rather than in form.",

      "question": "Are the arms accentuated with dynamic, brushstroke-like calligraphic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the arms are indeed highlighted with strong outlines that resemble dynamic brushstrokes, akin to calligraphy. This approach is consistent with styles found in Japanese printmaking, where strong, calligraphic lines are used to emphasize form and movement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face, excluding the blurred portion, is minimalistically depicted with simplified outlines, focusing on a serene expression rather than intricate detail. This approach matches the aesthetic of traditional Japanese art, which often conveys emotion and presence through restraint rather than complexity.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the sky features stylized and wave-like cloud patterns that contribute to a decorative and ethereal atmosphere. These clouds echo styles from traditional Japanese artwork, enhancing the two-dimensional quality and furthering the aesthetic transformation from realism to decorative art.",
