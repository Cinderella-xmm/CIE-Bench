      "question": "Is the lion rendered as a high-contrast silhouette with minimal internal detail and strong edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is depicted with considerable detail in both its mane and body, indicating textures and shading rather than a silhouette. There is a contrast between the lion and the background due to the lighting from the sunset, but it's not reduced to minimal internal detail. A silhouette typically lacks detail within its form, while here, the lion exhibits detailed textures, suggesting it is not a silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an abstract gradient composed of smooth color transitions rather than a realistic savannah landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background involves a vibrant sunset sky with defined clouds and a visible savannah landscape with acacia trees, providing a realistic and not an abstract representation. The sky's color transition is natural for a sunset and the landscape is clearly depicted, not an abstract gradient.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are detailed grass textures clearly visible in the foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground of Image B features grass with discernible textures illuminated by the warm light of the sunset. The lighting accentuates the details of the grass, making them prominent in the scene, which is characteristic of detailed texture depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the acacia trees depicted as angular, stylized silhouettes with sharp edges and geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acacia trees have a silhouette appearance due to the backlight from the sunset. They are depicted in such a way that their basic shape and structure are highlighted, forming angular and somewhat geometric profiles, typical of stylized silhouettes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"King of the Wild\" displayed in a dramatic, bold typeface across the upper section of the image without overpowering the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title in Image B reads 'KING THE WILD' in a large, bold typeface that is dramatically set against the darkened hues of the sky. It is placed prominently in the upper section but does not visually overpower the lion, as the warm light in the lower part draws attention to the lion, maintaining balance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned centrally and visually dominant in the composition, ensuring it remains the primary focus despite other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is prominently placed in the composition, slightly to the left but still central enough to dominate the scene. The lighting and detailed textures draw attention to it, making it the focal point despite the presence of the bold title and background elements.",
