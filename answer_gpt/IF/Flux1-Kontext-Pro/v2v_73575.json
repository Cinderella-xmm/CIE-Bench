      "question": "Is the bird on the left depicted as an animated origami figure with visible star chart patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the left is shown as an origami figure, with visible folding lines and a textured surface resembling paper. The base on which it stands appears to have star chart patterns, suggesting it might represent an origami themed by celestial elements. World knowledge about origami and star charts contributes to recognizing these features.",

      "question": "Does the bird on the right appear as a luminous crystalline structure with sharp edges and a glowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the right is depicted as a luminous crystalline structure. It has sharp, well-defined edges and displays a glowing effect, as if light is refracting through the material. Such appearances are typically indicative of materials like crystal or glass, which can enhance luminosity and radiance when light passes through.",

      "question": "Are both birds perched on colossal, intricately carved ivory chess rooks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both birds are not perched on rooks; rather, they are seemingly resting on more simple chess pieces that resemble pawns. The bases are not intricately carved to reflect rooks, and the chess piece design is relatively standard without elaborate detailing. Knowledge of chess pieces helps discern the difference between rooks and pawns.",

      "question": "Is the background a surreal library with bookshelves and books drifting through aisles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B depicts a long hallway with bookshelves displaying books, giving the impression of a library. However, there is no indication of books drifting through the aisles, and while the library has a somewhat ethereal atmosphere, it does not exhibit surreal elements like floating books. Understanding the characteristics of libraries aids in this distinction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the birds maintain a similar posture and position. The left bird presents a frontal view while standing, and the right bird shows a profile view while perched. The consistent pose and orientation between Image A and Image B indicate that the posture and position remain unchanged.",
