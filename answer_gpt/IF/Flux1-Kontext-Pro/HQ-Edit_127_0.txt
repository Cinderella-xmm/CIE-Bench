    "Question": "Q5: Is the moon depicted as a dotted diagram with labeled lunar phases (e.g., waxing gibbous, full moon)?",
    "explanation": "The moon in Image B includes dotted lines and labels that suggest it is used as a diagram. Although terms like 'Beak origin' and 'East crescent' appear on the image, these labels do not correspond directly to standard lunar phases such as 'waxing gibbous' or 'full moon'.
