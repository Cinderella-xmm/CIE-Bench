      "question": "Is the necklace and snake tail enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace and the snake tail are clearly seen within a glass dome structure. The glass surface's curvature is visible, and it encases both the necklace and the elements within. The presence of a wooden base also supports the idea of a dome-like enclosure. This is a demonstration of a common way to create a display that protects and enhances the visual appeal of an object.",

      "question": "Is the necklace now suspended as a floating chandelier supported by ornate branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the necklace appears to hang from the top of the glass dome via a chain, giving it a suspended look similar to a chandelier. Additionally, there are branches within the dome, but they do not support the necklace directly. Instead, they are more decorative elements within the scene, supporting the ambiance but not physically connected to the necklace.",

      "question": "Is there a glistening emerald-colored pond located at the base of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a distinct emerald-colored area at the base resembling a pond or a water feature, which fits the description of a glistening emerald-colored pond. It appears circular and reflects light, which helps in creating a shiny and inviting atmosphere. The reflective and colored qualities indicate the presence of a water-like feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are delicate silver leaves encircling the emerald pond at the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, silver leaves are visibly placed around the edge of the emerald-colored pond. These silver leaves add a decorative and delicate touch to the scene as they appear arranged around the water feature, contributing to an ornate and natural setting.",

      "question": "Does the snake tail emerge from a moss-covered bank within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays the snake tail emerging from an area that is covered in green moss-like vegetation at the base of the dome. This moss-covered section forms a bank around the emerald pond, from which the snake tail can be seen rising, reinforcing the idea of a naturalistic setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the scene include visual elements (e.g., glowing lights, mist, reflective surfaces) that contribute to a mystical atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does not explicitly depict glowing lights or mist, the combination of reflective surfaces, such as the glass dome and emerald pond, contributes to a mystical atmosphere. These elements collectively create an enchanting and magical aesthetic due to the interplay of light and visual arrangement inside the dome.",
