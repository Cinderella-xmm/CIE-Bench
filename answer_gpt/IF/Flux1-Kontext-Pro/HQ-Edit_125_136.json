    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows the text 'Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics' prominently at the top, indicating the theme or subject of the infographic. This is a common practice for clear identification and categorization of information within visuals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image uses simplified, cartoon-like illustrations of astronauts, which are typical characteristics of vector-style graphics. These are less detailed and stylized compared to the photorealistic rendering seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spacesuit include visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spacesuit depicted is simplified without detailed textures like stitching or fabric patterns. This kind of omission is characteristic of vector-style designs that focus on clear shapes and colors rather than intricate detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are gold accents used in the image to emphasize certain elements such as labels, borders, or arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image includes gold accents, most noticeably with arrows and stars, which are used to convey direction and movement. These accents serve to highlight and guide the viewer's attention to specific actions or transitions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there three sequential stages illustrated with arrows showing the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image clearly delineates three stages—Prepare, Navigate, Operate—using arrows to illustrate movement and progression. These arrows help convey the dynamic aspects of the astronaut's interaction or journey, maintaining sequence and logical flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the labels “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, and “Step 3: Operate” displayed in sequence along the bottom of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The labels for the steps are prominently displayed in sequence within the infographic, but not along the bottom. Instead, they appear directly adjacent to the illustrations of each stage, maintaining a logical visual and thematic connection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the entire infographic arranged in a vertical format with elements stacked from top to bottom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The infographic format arranges stages from left to right rather than in a vertical stack. This design choice aligns with typical practices for illustrating sequential concepts or processes, allowing a horizontal flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    }
