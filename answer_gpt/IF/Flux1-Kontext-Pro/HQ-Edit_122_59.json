      "question": "Is the elephant enclosed within a visible glass display case with ornate framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is clearly within a transparent glass case, which is visible through the reflections and clear boundaries around the scene. Additionally, the base of the case has visible ornate floral patterns, indicating an attention to decorative detail typical of an ornate framing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the elephant been scaled down to a miniature size relative to the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of multiple bonsai trees and a visible glass enclosure can suggest that the elephant is smaller than life-sized. Bonsai trees are generally small and are often used to create miniature landscapes. The glass case and its proportions relative to the elephant further support the idea of miniaturization.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible golden inlays integrated into the surface of the elephant sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B appears to have decorative patterns on its body that shine with a golden hue, suggesting the presence of golden inlays. These accents add a luxurious element to the sculpture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there multiple tiny bonsai trees positioned around the elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly visible, neatly arranged bonsai trees on either side of the elephant within the glass display. This arrangement supports the idea of an artificially crafted miniature landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the scene surrounding the elephant filled with a dense, miniature jungle rendered in vibrant, earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B includes bonsai trees and a green landscape, it does not depict a 'dense, miniature jungle.' The bonsai trees and other elements are more sparse and orderly, not creating a dense environment. The tones are consistent with a natural theme, but the overall scene lacks the density associated with a jungle.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the base resemble a smooth, polished stone with visible engraved floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B appears to be crafted from wood with engraved floral patterns, not stone. The texture and material visible in the base's surface suggest wood, aligning with designs that have intricate patterns. This is consistent with wooden ornateness rather than stone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all elements in the scene—glass case, bonsai, jungle, base, and elephant—harmonize in style and color to create a cohesive, elegant natural theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements including the glass case, bonsai, base, and inlaid elephant—though there is no jungle—share complementary earthy tones and ornate detailing. This creates a unified aesthetic, emphasizing harmony and elegance in a stylized, natural theme.",
