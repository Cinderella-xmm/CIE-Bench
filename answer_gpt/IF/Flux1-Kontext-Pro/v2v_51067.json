        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van is painted with vibrant teal and cream (which can be considered off-white) colors in a two-tone style. This paint scheme is very noticeable and is typical of custom or themed vehicles, often seen in retro designs such as surf vans, which use such vibrant and contrasting colors. The teal color covers the major portion, while the cream color accents the middle section, creating a visually attractive two-tone scheme.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grille of the van features shiny chrome elements, especially around the emblem which is identifiable as the Mercedes-Benz logo that commonly incorporates chrome details.

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a roof rack mounted on top of the van, which is loaded with surfboards displaying various colors such as orange, blue, and red.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to be shot in bright lighting conditions that suggest a sunny atmosphere. However, the colors on the van, specifically the vibrant teal and cream, seem very saturated rather than desaturated. The light conditions are clear, but the color saturation does not provide a desaturated style typically brought about by sun glare or soft lighting.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays design elements often associated with vintage surf vans of the 1970s, such as the two-tone paint job in vibrant colors and the roof rack loaded with surfboards. These elements contribute to a retro aesthetic common in classic surf culture, reflecting leisure and beach activities.",
