    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the totem pole now presented as a miniature scene within a confined space, suggesting a scaled-down 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the totem pole is enclosed within a glass dome, which suggests that it is a miniature representation, as glass domes are typically used for displaying and protecting small objects. The presence of relatively large plant elements, like the ferns and moss at the base, further reinforces the idea that this is a scaled-down environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the totem pole enclosed within a transparent cylindrical glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the totem pole is visually within a glass dome that is transparent and cylindrical in shape. This is evident from the clear reflections and distortions typical of a glass surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tiny ferns and moss visible at the base of the totem pole inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the base of the totem pole is surrounded by small green plants, specifically ferns and moss, which are visually distinct and add a naturalistic element to the scene. This supports the notion of a miniature ecosystem.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a butterfly perched on the top of the totem pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a butterfly can be seen resting on top of the totem pole. This adds a detail of nature, enhancing the aesthetic of a contained natural scene within the dome.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use an earthy color palette dominated by natural browns and greens, with visible wood texture and green plant accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image predominantly features shades of brown, from the wooden texture of the totem pole and the base, and greens from the moss and fern elements. This earthy palette is common in natural settings and is effectively used to convey a realistic, organic aesthetic.",
