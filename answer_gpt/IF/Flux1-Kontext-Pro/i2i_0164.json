        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only a single person standing on top of the train, whereas in Image A multiple people were there. The visual cue of a singular figure indicates a reduction in the number of people present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a person standing on the train, holding a flag in a formal pose which often denotes signaling or communication roles, commonly associated with a conductor. The presence of a uniform and flag further supports this identification.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparison between Image A and Image B shows that the multiple individuals on the train have been removed, and Image B features a single figure standing with a flag. This indicates an edit where the original people were replaced by a conductor with the logo flag.",
