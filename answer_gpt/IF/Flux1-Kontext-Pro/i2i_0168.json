      "question": "Is the background replaced with snow and icebergs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly shows snow and icebergs, suggestive of a cold and Arctic environment. These natural formations are commonly found in Arctic and Antarctic regions, substituted for the greenery visible in Image A. Comparing both images confirms that the background has been replaced.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the carrots still rooted in soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrots firmly rooted in the soil in the foreground. The visible soil around the carrots is dark and consistently textured, similar to typical fertile garden soil, indicating they remain in soil rather than any other material. Both images depict carrots in soil, confirming the carrots' placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the carrots retain their original appearance in terms of color and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots exhibit a bright orange color and a form consistent with typical carrots, including their top green leaves, echoing the appearance of the carrots in Image A. Both images illustrate carrots with an identical coloration and shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image show a clear contrast between the Arctic background and the soil around the carrots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clear contrast between the snowy and icy background of icebergs and the dark soil around the carrots. This juxtaposition highlights the improbable coexistence of typical agricultural soil amidst an Arctic setting, a contrast not present in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Is the overall setting of the image consistent with an Arctic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The prominent background featuring icebergs and snow in Image B is characteristic of an Arctic environment. This background contrasts with the agricultural setting of carrots in soil, which is unusual but visually integrates Arctic elements, making it consistent with an Arctic visual theme.",
