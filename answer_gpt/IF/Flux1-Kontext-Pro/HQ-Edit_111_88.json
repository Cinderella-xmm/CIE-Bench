        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and huts appear more stylized with smoother, curvilinear forms that are indicative of Art Nouveau influence, contrasting with the more naturalistic depiction in Image A. This redesign suggests a shift towards an artistic style where nature is expressed with elegance and fluidity.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B appears softer and more muted compared to the original, with transitions between colors that are reminiscent of the subtle, shimmery quality of stained glass. While not extremely iridescent, the contrast is noticeably lower than the saturated and vibrant palette seen in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
