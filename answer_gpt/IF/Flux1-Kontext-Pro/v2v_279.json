        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird features a 3D chibi-style design, characterized by simplified shapes and details that are rounded and exaggerated. Its wings and tail feathers have a rounded and more cartoon-like appearance, which is a key indicator of the chibi style. By contrast, in Image A, the bird appears more traditional with detailed feathers and a more realistic depiction. These observations confirm the transformation to a 3D chibi-style model.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the lemur in a chibi-style form, notable for its roundness and exaggerated proportions.
