      "question": "Has the church been rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified shapes and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the church with realistic architectural details such as windows, arches, and proportions with a photographic representation rather than simplified or stylized lines typical of a semi-cartoon style. The render retains intricate architectural elements and realistic proportions, not stylized or simplified.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the church facade exhibits a high degree of symmetry with matching windows, doors, and decorative elements on both sides from a frontal perspective. Such symmetry is typical in architectural design and aligns with the appearance in the edited image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The focus of Image B is on the architectural structure under a cosmic background. The spires and upper parts maintain their stone and brick appearance without visible metallic gold accents. Gold accents would noticeably alter the color scheme and dervices but are not present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the church appear consistent and unchanged, maintaining realistic dimensions. No evidence suggests deliberate alteration to enhance its grandeur; it retains its original scale and proportions",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B clearly features a cosmic theme, displaying stars and galaxies, which contrasts with typical earthly settings. This celestial backdrop serves to enhance artistic expression and differentiate it from the urban background seen in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
