      "question": "Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are sections that focus on different components such as the blouse, lehenga, dupatta, and jewelry. However, these sections are not in chibi-style illustrations nor are there exactly six separate illustrations. Instead, Image B consists of combinations of mannequin displays and a full outfit along with jewelry. Thus, there are not six separate chibi-style illustrations.",

      "question": "Do all six magnets exhibit a vibrant, glossy surface with visible reflections or shine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the components such as the blouse, lehenga, dupatta, and jewelry are focused areas, but they are not displayed as magnets. The surfaces of the components in the images do not have a distinctive glossy or reflective aspect. Therefore, the criteria for vibrant and glossy surfaces of magnets are not met.",

      "question": "Do all six magnets have clearly rounded edges instead of sharp corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no objects presented as magnets. The images are photographs of a mannequin wearing the outfit along with jewelry, which do not have rounded or sharp corners as they are not magnets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the six magnets accurately depict one of the following: the embellished purple blouse, the intricate lehenga with floral patterns, the red dupatta, the traditional jewelry, the silver bangles, or the ornate background wall pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does feature a purple blouse, a lehenga, a red dupatta, jewelry, bangles, and a wall pattern; however, these are not represented as magnets nor separately depict each element. They are part of a composite mannequin display and photography rather than individual magnet depictions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B, comprising a mannequin with traditional attire and jewelry, are photographed realistically and not illustrated in a chibi art style. There are no exaggerated proportions or simplified facial features seen in the images, as they are not illustrated items.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature separate standalone items as magnets. Rather, the elements of attire and jewelry are shown either on a mannequin or alongside the mannequin. Thus, they are not standalone items arranged in a manner suggestive of a collectible set.",
