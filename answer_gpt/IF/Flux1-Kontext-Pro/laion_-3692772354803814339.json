      "question": "Does the bottle appear as a transparent crystal vessel with visible swirling ocean wave patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is depicted with a transparent look, allowing for a clear view of intricate ocean wave patterns inside the vessel, resembling swirling waves. This transparency and the detailed ocean-themed design inside strongly resemble a crystal-like vessel, which is distinct from typical opaque bottles. Thus, the visible patterns inside suggest it is a crystal vessel with swirling ocean waves.",

      "question": "Is the label replaced with intricate golden maritime symbols instead of the original text and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a significant change in the labeling of the packaging. Instead of traditional text and design, there is a prominent golden compass emblem and other nautical elements that are both visually distinct and different from standard packaging labels. The maritime symbols dominate and replace the usual text-based label seen in generic whisky bottles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the packaging been transformed into a parchment-like scroll with aged texture and scroll-like edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging surrounding the bottle visibly resembles a scroll and exhibits an aged texture. There are clearly designed scroll-like edges, and the appearance strongly mimics ancient parchment rather than standard carton or cylindrical cardboard packaging seen in typical products. This transformation aligns with the descriptive factors of a scroll-like and aged appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the top of the packaging feature a compass rose with metallic-looking directional points set against a parchment background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a compass rose prominently placed at the top of the parchment-style packaging, with metallic-looking points clearly visible against the backdrop. This intricate design matches the thematic parchment background and signifies a maritime style, which is distinct from plain packaging tops seen in ordinary products.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bottle and packaging exhibit ethereal qualities such as glowing edges, light refraction, or a mystical aura consistent with an elixir vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys an ethereal quality through the bottle's visible glow and the clear fluid inside, reminiscent of light refraction and mystical aura. These qualities reflect an artistic endeavor to resemble an elixir vessel, distinct from typical whisky bottles, which lack such detailed and mystical design aspects. The transparent nature of the bottle and its luminescence align with characteristics often associated with magical or enchanting objects.",
