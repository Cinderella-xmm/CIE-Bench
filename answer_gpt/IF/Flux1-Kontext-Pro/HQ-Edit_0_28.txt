    "Question": "Q1: Has the overall scene been resized and framed vertically to resemble a bookmark format?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears to be constrained within a tall, narrow frame with decorative corner elements that evoke the aesthetic of a bookmark. This framing isn't present in Image A, which has a more standard rectangular shape. The presence of ornamental motifs and the taller, slimmer profile in Image B support the idea of a bookmark format.",
