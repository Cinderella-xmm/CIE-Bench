      "question": "Has the overall scene been resized and framed vertically to resemble a bookmark format?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears to be constrained within a tall, narrow frame with decorative corner elements that evoke the aesthetic of a bookmark. This framing isn't present in Image A, which has a more standard rectangular shape. The presence of ornamental motifs and the taller, slimmer profile in Image B support the idea of a bookmark format.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the man's robe feature abstract geometric patterns rendered in muted earth tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's robe has visible dark patterns that are geometric in nature, suggesting a more traditional style consistent with a muted earth tone palette. The patterns are not prominently contrasting, blending softly with the rest of the attire, which supports the description of muted earth tones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the lamps been transformed into decorative corner flourishes with intricate design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamps have been retained but there are also intricate decorative elements in the corners of the frame, which are separate from the lamps. The corner designs are ornamental and intricate but do not replace the lamps. Therefore, the lamps themselves have not been transformed into the decorative elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bookcase extended into a textured background that includes subtle script elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf remains an element of the background, but it also features additional texture overlays and subtle script-like elements that are not present in Image A. The integration into a more complex background with these details aligns with the notion of an extended, textured backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there clearly defined blank spaces or margins in the image suitable for placing inspirational quotes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a decorative border that leaves a blank area beneath the primary scene, this openly invites additional content such as text. This margin space is markedly missing in Image A, suggesting a clear potential for text placement in Image B.",
