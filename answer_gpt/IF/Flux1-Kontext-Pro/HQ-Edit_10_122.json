      "question": "Is the portrait rendered in a flat, stylized manner consistent with a mural painted on a wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B suggest a mural-like style due to the use of vibrant colors and bold outlines. Murals often employ flat, stylized depictions to convey art in a more iconic and simplified form. This is supported by the consistent color application and the absence of realistic shading that usually imitates three-dimensional forms, common in flat art styles like murals.",
