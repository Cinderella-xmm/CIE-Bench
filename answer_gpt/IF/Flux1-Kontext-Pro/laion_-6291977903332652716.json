      "question": "Is the entire canal scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears to be encapsulated within a clear, spherical object. This is suggested by the curved appearance of the buildings and environment, which is indicative of a lens-like effect associated with viewing through a transparent sphere. This reflection and refraction effect is characteristic of a glass or crystal structure. The boundary is visibly enclosing and distorting the view like a snow globe.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the timber-framed houses rendered with enhanced texture detail and colored in muted autumnal tones (e.g., browns, oranges, soft reds)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the timber-framed houses appear inside a spherical object and the visible details such as the textures are distorted but still recognizable. They maintain their original color scheme (as observed in common European half-timbered architecture), with hues of browns and whites. While the lighting might slightly change the perception of color, the colors are not specifically muted to autumnal tones in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the canal water appear glossy and reflective, resembling a polished resin surface rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canal water, as seen through the sphere, exhibits a high degree of glossiness and reflection typical of polished surfaces like resin or glass. This effect is exaggerated by the spherical encapsulation, which enhances the reflectivity and smooth appearance, giving it a more artificial look compared to natural water, which usually has a more textured and less uniformly reflective surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there scaled-down, detailed mini bridges and additional greenery (such as small plants or moss) integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene contained within the sphere does include small bridges and greenery, but they are not newly integrated miniature versions or additional elements. They are original parts of the scene now viewed distortedly through the spherical lens. There is no special mention or indication of extra miniaturization or insertion that contributes additional features beyond the original environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, stylized human figures in vibrant clothing positioned along the walkways, appearing as hand-sculpted models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, given the magnified perspective within the sphere, you can indeed see small figures along the walkway. These figures appear smaller and more stylized due to the spherical distortion effect, but they look like part of the original scene seen with a lens-like visual adjustment rather than separately added hand-sculpted miniatures. However, in the blurred background outside the sphere, there are human figures that seem to appear miniature and colorful, suggesting an artistic model-like setting.",
