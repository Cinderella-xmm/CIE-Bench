        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's feathers are depicted with vibrant and fiery colors featuring a gradation of reds, oranges, golds, and blues, suggesting iridescence.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, subtle gold elements are visible along the rooster's feathers which may resemble liquid metal or glowing gold. These accents are strategically placed, providing the appearance of molten gold.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the rooster's eyes appear unnaturally bright and exhibit glowing characteristics that could signify the presence of internal motion akin to flickering flames.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B presents an elaborate and decorative depiction of the rooster, the talons do not show visible ancient rune-like patterns.
