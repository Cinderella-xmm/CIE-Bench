      "question": "Has the Sphinx’s head been replaced with a radiant sun disc featuring visible hieroglyphic patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the Sphinx is not replaced by a radiant sun disc. The sun is depicted behind the Sphinx, adding a halo effect, but the Sphinx's head has been altered to appear more anthropomorphic and detailed, resembling an Egyptian god with an elaborate headdress, rather than showing visible hieroglyphic patterns on a disc.",

      "question": "Are there shimmering golden wings extending from both sides of the Sphinx’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sphinx features large, shimmering golden wings extending from both sides of its body. This is a significant alteration from the standard Sphinx, which typically does not have wings. The wings are detailed and add an element of fantasy, indicating a blend between the Sphinx and mythological creatures like the Griffin.",

      "question": "Do the limbs of the Sphinx show flowing desert sands cascading downward from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the limbs of the Sphinx do not have desert sands flowing from them. The design of the Sphinx shows distinctive and embellished limbs, but no visual elements like cascading sands are present on the limbs.",

      "question": "Are there ankhs glowing in azure color located on the paws of the Sphinx?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that ankhs are prominently placed and glowing in an azure color on the Sphinx’s paws. This is an addition intended to emphasize the mystical and symbolic aspect of the Sphinx in this edited image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the Sphinx still positioned in the same location relative to the background elements (such as the pyramid and sunset), with the sun disc correctly placed where the head was?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the general positioning relative to the background elements such as the pyramid and sunset remains consistent, the sun disc is not placed where the head of the Sphinx was. Instead, the Sphinx in Image B has an anthropomorphic head and a sun as a backdrop, creating a different visual composition than simply replacing the head with the sun.",
