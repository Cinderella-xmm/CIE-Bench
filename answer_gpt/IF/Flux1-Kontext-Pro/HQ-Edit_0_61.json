      "question": "Is the entire scene reimagined as a conceptual tea brand packaging design, where the original tea setup serves as part of the product presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of a wooden box with carvings and an illustration of a teapot, suggesting that the scene has been transformed from a realistic tea room setup to a conceptual presentation, possibly for branding or packaging purposes. The original tea setup no longer serves as an actual setting but as a part of a decorative or thematic presentation.",

      "question": "Is the central table redesigned to resemble a tea box lid with visible engraved leaf patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the upper part displays a wooden box with elaborate engravings, including leaf patterns, similar to what could be found on a tea box. This suggests that the central table in the original image might have been reinterpreted as the lid of a tea box with such designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original tea cups replaced with illustrated representations of sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the actual tea setup with a carving and an illustration. There is no depiction of tea cups in sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics. Instead, it presents decorative and conceptual art.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible tag displaying the text \"Zen Autumn Tea\" written in elegant calligraphy style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tag hanging from the wooden box with some text in what appears to be an Asian script. However, it does not clearly display text in English, such as 'Zen Autumn Tea,' in elegant calligraphy style. The script seems more ornamental or part of branding.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot enclosed within a leaf-shaped silhouette and rendered with subtle earthy textures such as wood grain or soil tones to suggest organic origin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the lower section of Image B, there is an illustration of a teapot. It is not enclosed within a leaf-shaped silhouette but is drawn with lines that might suggest texture. It doesn't have a distinct wood grain or soil tone that clearly indicates an organic origin. Instead, it appears to be a simple sketch without elaborate textures.",
