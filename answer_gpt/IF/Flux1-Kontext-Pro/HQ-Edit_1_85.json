        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image appears as a singular illustration of a girl holding a violin. There is no indication of multiple panels or divisions that would suggest a series or set of postcards.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
