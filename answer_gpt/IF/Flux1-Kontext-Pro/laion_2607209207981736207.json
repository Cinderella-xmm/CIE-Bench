      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the original scanner completely replaced by a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a box that illustrates the scanner as part of its design on the surface; however, the actual object in the image is the box. This suggests that the image focuses on the packaging of the scanner rather than the scanner itself. Therefore, the original scanner in Image A is not physically present in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the packaging feature visible metallic textures such as brushed metal, chrome, or reflective surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging design uses digital illustrations and lighting effects to imply a tech-themed appearance, with a significant amount of glowing blue lines and text. However, there is no indication of actual metallic textures such as brushed metal or chrome on the packaging. The overall look is more digital and virtual rather than physical metallic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging exhibit an iridescent color effect with shifting hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging design in Image B predominantly uses a black background with electric blue highlights and lines. This style is more consistent with a high-tech theme and does not show iridescent color effects or shifting hues typically associated with an iridescent surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a holographic display on the front of the packaging showing the scanner in operation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a digital representation of the scanner on the box itself, which appears to simulate a glowing display effect. However, this is printed or digitally rendered and not an actual holographic display. It is designed to look like a digital blueprint or schematic, rather than showing a 3D hologram in operation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible grid lines or circuit-like patterns across the surface of the packaging that resemble data flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging displays detailed lines and shapes resembling a digital interface or circuitry. These elements contribute to a futuristic tech aesthetic, which aligns with the concept of grid lines or circuit-like patterns representing data flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there tech-themed icons (e.g., circuits, data streams, digital symbols) and modern branding elements visible on the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several tech-themed symbols and elements on the packaging, including icons and graphic elements that convey the image of modern technology. These include stylized text and branding that emphasizes a tech-focused product.",
