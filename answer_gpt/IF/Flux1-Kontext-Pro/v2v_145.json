        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is neatly cubed and presented in a typical fruit cutting style common for mangoes. There are no indications of transformation into a figurine, whimsical or otherwise. A whimsical figurine would be expected to have distinctive anthropomorphic or imaginative features which are not present here; it remains as neatly cut mango cubes. Thus, combining visual cues with common sense about what constitutes a figurine, the conclusion is clear.",

      "question": "Have the cut mango pieces been slightly increased in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango pieces appear uniformly large and carefully cut, exhibiting clear and sharp cubical shapes. To determine if there's an increase in size, a comparison can be made with Image A: The mango in Image A also exhibits well-cut cubes, but the distinction between the two images in terms of the size of the cubes isnâ€™t visually noticeable. Both images show similar sized mango cubes. Thus, based on visual cues, no clear change in size is observed.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango pieces exhibit a fresh and vibrant look, with their surfaces showing some reflective qualities that enhance their 3D appearance. The slices have a realistic depth and shine, typical of ripe, juicy mangoes. This effect can be attributed to lighting and presentation, which give the pieces a slightly shiny three-dimensional look. Thus, based on visual perception and knowledge of photographic enhancement techniques, the mango pieces do appear to have a 3D effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime and chili powder bowl present realistic textures and shapes typical of a natural fruit slice and a simple wooden bowl. Cartoons often exaggerate features like color saturation or shape, whereas the objects here maintain a natural appearance. Given the textures and detail present, they do not exhibit cartoon-like characteristics such as simplified, exaggerated, or stylized forms common in cartoon designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setup is seen on a flat surface that appears to have a corner, which is typical of a shelf or table. The room's angle and the positioning next to a vertical surface strongly suggest a shelf configuration. The background supports the idea of a limited space, typical for shelving. Therefore, using spatial recognition and understanding of furniture design, it's reasonable to conclude that the setup is indeed on a shelf.",
