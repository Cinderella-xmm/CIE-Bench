        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, it is apparent that there are strong, thick ink outlines surrounding the elements such as the car, motion indicators, and lettering. These outlines are characteristic of comic or graphic novel illustrations, designed to make objects and characters stand out distinctly. Thus, the artistic choice to use ink outlines is evident across the image.",
