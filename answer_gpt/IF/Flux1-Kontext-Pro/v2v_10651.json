        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects, including the bottle, opener, and glass, have a uniform matte texture, characteristic of clay. They lack the shine and reflective properties typical of metal or glass, suggesting a clay or ceramic appearance. The shapes are also slightly softer and more uniform, similar to handmade clay models.",
