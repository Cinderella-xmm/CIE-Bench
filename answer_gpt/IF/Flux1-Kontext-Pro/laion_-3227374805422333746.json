      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the house presented as a standalone collectible game asset, positioned as if part of a board game scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house is indeed part of a larger scene that resembles a board game setup. The house is placed on a board with various sections and cards placed around it. The presence of two miniature figures nearby also suggests that it is part of a board game scene, rather than being a standalone asset.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the colors of the house been changed to earthy tones such as browns, tans, and muted greens instead of bright reds and yellows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house's colors appear more subdued and fit into earthy tones, especially on the base of the board that features greens and browns. Further inspection shows that the structure itself retains its bright red roof, indicating no change to muted colors from Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there visible moss texture applied to the base of the house, particularly along the foundation or lower walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, looking closely at the base of the house, particularly where it meets the green grass-like texture of the board, there is some green indicative of moss. This visual detail might suggest moss growth along the lower sections of the house.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone textures are clearly preserved on the house, as the pillars and various wall sections retain their stone appearance from Image A. The wooden elements are present in the form of logs, not as replacements for existing stone structures.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two miniatures resembling fantasy characters are seen positioned next to the house. These figurines, dressed in what appears to be medieval attire, fit the description of fantasy characters such as knights.",
