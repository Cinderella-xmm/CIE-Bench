    "Question": "Q1: Is the image now structured as a multi-panel infographic with at least three distinct steps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we can observe that it is formatted as a comic-style infographic with text-heavy panels. The second image consists of three separate panels, suggesting that it indeed is a multi-panel structure. This aligns with the common design of comic strips or instructional graphics where sequential steps or instructions are divided into distinct visual sections.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is there a panel showing a simple figure in a kneeling position with bent arms pulled back, labeled as 'Step 1: Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back'?",
    "explanation": "Image B does contain a figure with bent arms pulled back on what appears to be a stand, but the label 'Step 1' does not correspond exactly to the statement in the question. Instead, the label mentions 'LEAP USING CORE TIEGHT,' suggesting a different action from kneeling positioning.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a panel showing an explosive leaping motion with visual cues of propulsion (e.g., motion lines, energy burst), labeled as 'Step 2: Leap Attack: Propel using core strength'?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is visually expressive language such as 'LEAP USING CORE TIEGHT' with motion lines that imply movement. However, the label does not match the exact wording 'Step 2: Leap Attack: Propel using core strength.' The discrepancies in wording exclude this from a positive identification.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a panel showing the figure mid-air with knees tucked tightly, labeled as 'Step 3: Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly'?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes panels where the character is in positions suggesting motion. However, none of the panels contain the exact phrasing 'Step 3: Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly.' Instead, they show dynamic positions with alternate text, e.g., 'Mict Kneis Tightly' which alters the outcome.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Are the illustrations rendered with bold outlines, vibrant blues and whites as dominant colors, and captions written in energetic, stylized fonts?",
    "explanation": "The illustrations in Image B are indeed outlined boldly, demonstrating a comic-book or graphic-novel style. The blues and whites are dominant colors in the representation of the character's attire, and the captions use a font that is both striking and stylized, which is commonly seen in energetic visual media.",
    "answer": "Yes"
