      "question": "Is only one zebra visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, upon analyzing the visual cues, only one zebra is clearly visible against the green background. This observation aligns with my understanding that a singular zebra is present. Thus, the conclusion is straightforward.",

      "question": "Has all the grass been removed from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background appears as a smooth green surface without any texture or elements resembling grass. This suggests that all grass has been removed and replaced. Based on this observation, the conclusion is that the grass is removed.",

      "question": "Is the grass area replaced by a green gradient plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background appears as an even green area without visible variations or contours typical of a grassy area. While it lacks specific gradient transitions, it can be described as a plane with a uniform color. Therefore, it can be concluded as replaced by a green plane.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the solitary zebra on a uniform green background presents a minimalistic scene that can be interpreted as calm and solitary. There are no additional elements to distract from this focused view, supporting the conclusion of a tranquil atmosphere.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the zebra in the edited image with the original, the zebra's position appears consistent, and its appearance (like its stripes pattern and orientation) remains unchanged, indicating preservation of its original stance and look.",
