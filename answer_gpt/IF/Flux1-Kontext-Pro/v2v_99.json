      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer player is shown as a chibi-style 3D figure based on the visual cues such as the exaggerated, cartoonish body proportions and facial features. The head is larger relative to the body, which is a common characteristic of chibi-style figures, reflecting a playful and cute aesthetic. Such characteristics align with the world knowledge of chibi art style, which is used to create an appealing, miniature representation of characters.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is seen in a dynamic action pose with one leg extended towards the soccer ball, indicating a mid-kick position.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd maintain a realistic appearance.
