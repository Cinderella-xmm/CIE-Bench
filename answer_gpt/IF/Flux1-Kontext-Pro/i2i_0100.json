      "question": "Does the edited image include a top-down view of the sink structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two images showing a top-down perspective: the two sinks feature plants and faucets, which are indicative of a bathroom vanity viewed from above. This perspective highlights the layout of the sink, faucet, and other elements typically found on top of a vanity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a depiction of a sink structure viewed from an angle, where the front and top surfaces of the vanity are visible, providing an overall look at the sink layout, the position of the doors, and the sink's general structure from the side.",

      "question": "Are the top-down view and the angled side view merged into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top-down view and the angled side view of the sink structure are presented separately within the frame but are not merged together into one single image. Each perspective is distinct and occupies its own space in the composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout in Image B is clear and well-organized, with each perspective of the sink structure positioned in a distinct and non-overlapping manner. The separation allows for easy comparison and understanding of the different views of the vanity structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both the top-down view and the angled side view accurately depict the sink structure seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzed, both the top-down and angled side views in Image B depict a sink structure similar to the one seen in Image A. Common features like the style of the faucet, the positioning of the sinks, and the use of potted plants are consistent across both images, suggesting an accurate depiction. However, there are elements like drawer and door configurations that could vary slightly due to different visual interpretations.",
