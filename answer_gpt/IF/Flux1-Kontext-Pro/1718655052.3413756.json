      "question": "Are the hat and scarf now made of wood with visible carving marks and engraved textures that mimic the original woolly pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf retain their knitted look with no indication of wooden material. The surface appears soft and woolen, clearly suggesting textile rather than hard surfaces like wood, supported by the visibility of knitting patterns, buttons, and textures typical of fabric materials.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the fur coat has the appearance of layered textile wool patterns typical of typical toy stuffed animals, rather than LEGO bricks. The visual cues indicate a soft appearance absent of the hard edges and structured arrangement characterized by LEGO bricks.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without considering the blurred section, other visible elements such as the hat and scarf, retain their features without observable alterations. The analysis of distinct features relies on visible data outside the obscured area, which remains consistent in material and texture within both images.",

      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used for the coat composed of warm colors such as orange, red, yellow, or brown to visually suggest warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the visible parts and accessories like the scarf and hat, these are made of textile material in warm shades like orange that suggest warmth. However, these materials are not LEGO bricks, indicating no presence of hard plastic elements. This analysis confirms the absence of LEGO usage in visual apparel features.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any depiction of falling snow, presenting instead a clean wooden backdrop. This reflects a contrast to any outdoor snowy scene implied in the original, thereby eliminating snow elements to maintain visual consistency with the warm indoor setting.",
