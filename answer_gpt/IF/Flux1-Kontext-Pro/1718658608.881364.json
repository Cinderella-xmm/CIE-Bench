      "question": "Is the octopus replaced by a series of curved ceramic sculptures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a singular object featuring multiple tentacle-like extensions, reminiscent of an octopus structure. Its form suggests a sculptural design rather than a natural organism. Based on this visual information, it is reasonable to conclude that the octopus is replaced by a sculpture rather than a series of sculptures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sculptures exhibit a glossy, reflective surface consistent with glazed ceramic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the octopus-like structure in Image B is shiny and reflects light, which is typical of glazed ceramic materials. This observation leads to the conclusion that the structure has a glossy, reflective appearance in line with glazed ceramics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sculptures colored in deep oceanic blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color of the object in Image B is predominantly a rich blue, which aligns with tones often associated with oceanic imagery. This deep blue color reinforces the interpretation of being ocean-themed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sculptures feature textured scales that resemble the original octopus skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection, the edited structure in Image B displays a texture with small protrusions similar to scales or suction cups. This texture bears resemblance to the natural texture found on octopus skin observed in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a smooth, sandy-colored surface without natural textures or features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plain background with a uniform sandy color and lacks any natural textures or features such as those visible in an outdoor setting or beach scene. This identifies the background as smooth and monochromatic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a harmonious wave pattern that reflects the motion of ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The octopus-like sculpture in Image B does not demonstrate a pattern resembling ocean waves; instead, it appears in a static, singular form without complex arrangement. Therefore, there is no visible harmony with any wave pattern.",
