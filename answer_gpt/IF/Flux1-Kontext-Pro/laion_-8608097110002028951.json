      "question": "Is the facade of the theater building constructed from visible tan LEGO bricks with brown accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the theater building appears to be made of materials resembling LEGO bricks. The tan color of the facade suggests that it is constructed from tan LEGO bricks. The dark brown details seen above the windows and along the top of the building, which look like accents typical of LEGO construction sets, support this conclusion. The consistent block size and the appearance of seams between the bricks further suggest the use of LEGO materials.",

      "question": "Are the large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO pieces arranged in a grid pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large arched windows are composed of what appear to be translucent square elements lined up in an orderly grid pattern. This kind of arrangement is common in LEGO sets, where smaller, clear plastic pieces are used to simulate glass windows, organized neatly to maintain a structured, brick-like appearance. The visible grid on the windows signifies the use of LEGO pieces.",

      "question": "Are the marquee signs for \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" rendered using smooth red flat LEGO bricks to form the letters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marquee signs for 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' are depicted as text on a smooth red surface, consistent with the way lettering is typically rendered in LEGO models. The red flat LEGO bricks serve as the base, while the letters are smoothly integrated. The uniformity and smoothness suggest that these signs are designed using LEGO bricks, which often use flat tiles for signs and lettering.",

      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles, one in black and one in purple, with angular, modular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage cars appear to be rendered with a blocky, angular design indicative of LEGO vehicles. The black and purple colors align with typical LEGO bricks used for vehicles. The car structures exhibit simplified, geometric shapes and modular construction, a common trait of LEGO models, indicating that these cars are intended to represent LEGO versions of vintage vehicles.",

      "question": "Does the entire scene—including the building, cars, and signage—appear as a cohesive, playful, miniature LEGO model with consistent blocky textures and toy-like proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B conveys a scene where every element, including the building, cars, and signage, has a toy-like, playful design, consistent with LEGO models. The textures are uniform with blocky, angular surfaces common to LEGO, and the proportions are scaled down to reflect a miniature LEGO diorama. This cohesiveness across all elements of the image, including the sky with stylized clouds, reinforces the impression of a cohesive LEGO model.",
