        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the words 'Berry Good Breakfast Choices' are prominently displayed at the top of the image. This is a clear, bold text easily visible and intended to serve as the main title for the content below. The color contrast and size of the font make the title stand out, which aligns with common design principles for headings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoon-style pie slice that appears similar to the pie in Image A, but no additional vibrant blueberry illustrations are clearly added on the surface of the pie slice. Instead, the slice maintains a straightforward design similar to Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are graphical elements that appear to be blueberries, labeled with mostly nonsensical or undecipherable text like 'LUSERITION BURTES'.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon-like tea mug in Image B has facial features but does not appear to be engaging in any gesture or containing text that presents a healthy eating tip. The tips are separately listed under 'Healthy Eating Tips', not directly associated with the mug.",
