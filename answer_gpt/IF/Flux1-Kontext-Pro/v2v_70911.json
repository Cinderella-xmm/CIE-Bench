        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the interior of the cracked open container filled with a vibrant and visually striking formation, resembling a nebula. The swirling patterns and luminous quality suggest a nebula-like structure, aligning with common representations of nebulas in scientific imagery and popular culture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B reveals a miniature nebula that predominantly features vibrant hues, especially fiery reds and energetic pinks. These colors dominate the internal formation, suggesting an intense and dynamic visual effect that is characteristic of energetic cosmic phenomena like nebulas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A contains an abstract design featuring fiery red and pink hues, representative of an explosive or dynamic style matching the aesthetic of Image B's nebula. Upon comparison, the colors in the nebula of Image B mirror the colors on the label design of Image A, suggesting a consistent color theme employed in both images.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surrounding the nebula, the background is populated with numerous small, white, and faint dots resembling distant stars. This setup suggests not just any explosion but one set in a cosmic context, mirroring common representations of space and cosmic phenomena.",
