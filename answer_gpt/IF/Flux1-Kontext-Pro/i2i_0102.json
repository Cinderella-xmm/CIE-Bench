      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Draft' appears to be in a cursive style, which is typically associated with handwriting. The letters flow together, suggesting a handwritten font rather than a standard printed typeface. Commonly, handwritten fonts mimic the natural flow of writing with a pen or pencil. Hence, based on the visual appearance of the letters, it can be concluded that it uses a handwritten font.",

      "question": "Is the word “Draft” placed on the yellow paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exclusively shows a bright yellow background, with the word 'Draft' prominently centered. There are no indications of other surfaces or layers besides the yellow area, which resembles paper. Typically, when text is shown against a uniform colored background like this, it suggests it is part of the flat surface, such as printed on paper. Thus, the word 'Draft' is placed on the yellow paper.",

      "question": "Does the image resemble a design sketch cover focused on presenting the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a minimalist scene with the word 'Draft' as the sole embellishment on a plain yellow background. This simplicity, with a central focus on a single word, can suggest a design sketch or cover whose primary purpose is to highlight the word 'Draft.' Design sketch covers often emphasize key text elements in a clean and thematic manner. Therefore, it is reasonable to interpret this image as resembling such a design sketch cover.",

      "question": "Is the word “Draft” clearly visible and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Draft' is prominently displayed on a contrasting yellow background in the image, ensuring high visibility. Each letter is clearly defined, and the text is centered and unobstructed, making it easily readable. The clarity and legibility of text are typically assessed by contrast, size, and placement—all of which are favorable in this instance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the image appears to consist solely of a yellow background and the word 'Draft.' No additional visual elements, such as decorations, logos, or peripheral objects, are detectable. The simplicity and uniformity of the background further indicate that there are no other elements present in this image.",
