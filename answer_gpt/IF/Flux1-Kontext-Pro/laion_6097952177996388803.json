      "question": "Does the edited image depict the mountain range as a mythical beast with identifiable features such as a head, body, or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear representation of a creature that appears to be a mythical beast. This creature has distinguishable features such as large horns, a distinct head, and limbs, which are identifiable against the backdrop of the mountainous landscape. The presence of these features indicates an artistic transformation from a natural mountain range into a mythological creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the two highest peaks appear as large, curved, horn-like structures emerging from the top of the mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the highest peaks are not depicted as mountain peaks but rather as part of the mythical creature, specifically as large, curved horns that are characteristic of certain legendary or fantastical beasts. These horns add to the creature-like appearance of the entire formation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky surfaces of the mountains visibly altered to resemble a textured hide, such as scaly or rugged skin-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the surface of the creature with a texture that mimics a natural looking hide or skin, different from the typical rocky surface of mountains. This texture enhances the beast-like appearance, suggesting a transformation from inanimate rock formations to a living entity with a rough, tactile surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible mossy patterns and root-like structures along the mountain slopes that resemble tangled fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are patterns that suggest a combination of mossy and root-like structures. These patterns extend across the body of the creature, giving it the appearance of having fur or a similar textured surface. This effect is achieved by artistically modifying the landscape to resemble overgrown and intertwined organic material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the valleys been transformed into sinewy, muscular structures that follow the natural contours of the land but resemble biological musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the landscape is creatively modified to appear as a mythical beast, the valleys and contours of the land are not specifically altered to resemble sinewy, muscular structures. The transformation focuses more on the surface texture and overall shape rather than specific muscular features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible earthy aura surrounding or emanating from the mythical beast, such as warm tones, glowing mist, or ambient light suggesting an organic, natural presence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the focus is primarily on the creature's form and the conversion of the landscape into a mythical beast. There is no specific visual effect, such as an earthy aura, glowing mist, or ambient light, that suggests an organic presence beyond the creature itself.",
