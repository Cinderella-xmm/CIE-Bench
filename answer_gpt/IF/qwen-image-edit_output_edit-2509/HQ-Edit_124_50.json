      "question": "Is the horse visibly composed of distinct 3D puzzle pieces with defined edges separating each section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse appears as a single, continuous form with intricate floral patterns painted on it. The surface texture and design of the horse give no indication of distinct puzzle pieces or defined edges separating each section. The visual cues suggest a cohesive, smooth surface without segmentation typical of 3D puzzles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the horse enclosed within a wooden-framed display case that has a transparent glass dome covering it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is distinctly enclosed within a display case characterized by a transparent glass dome resting on a wooden base. The dome is clear, allowing full visibility of the horse within, suggesting that it is indeed covered by such a structure. The wooden frame is implied by the wooden base, although a complete framework is not visually confirmed beyond the base and the enclosing dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the display case rest on a textured wooden base that shows natural wood grain or carving details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B clearly displays natural wood grain, which is indicative of such texture, visible through the detailing and the finish used on the wood. The presence of natural wood grain is visually confirmed as well as carving details that enhance the overall appearance of the wooden base supporting the glass dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the intricate floral patterns on the horse fragmented across individual puzzle sections, with no single piece showing a complete motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the intricate floral patterns on the horse are whole and coherent, as they appear as complete motifs painted onto the smooth surface of the horse. There is no evidence of fragmentation across puzzle sections; rather, the patterns run smoothly over the surface of the horse without interruption from edges or puzzle Segmentation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a vintage-style compass embedded or placed on the wooden base of the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a compass located on the wooden base of the display case. The design of the compass, with its brass finish and traditional pointer, conveys a vintage aesthetic that fits the description of a vintage-style compass. Its placement, directly on the base beneath the glass dome, suggests it is either embedded or securely positioned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B features an antique-brass colored fixture at the top center of the glass dome, enhancing the vintage aesthetic and functionality of the case. This finish provides the display case with a decorative and traditional touch, consistent with the presence of brass accents.",
