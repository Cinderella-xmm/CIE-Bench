        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region previously occupied by what appears to be a mirror has been replaced by an artwork that covers the original space entirely. There is no reflective surface visible, which indicates the absence of a mirror. The reasoning involves identifying the characteristics typically associated with a mirror—such as reflection—and their absence in Image B.",

      "question": "Has the area previously occupied by the mirror been replaced with a minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of a landscape with mountains and a river in varied shades of green, located where the mirror was initially found in Image A. This landscape is simple in design, aligning with a minimalist style, which features plain shapes and a restrained color palette. Through comparing the visual elements present in Image B with typical minimalist art characteristics, this conclusion is drawn.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork exhibits characteristics, such as a slightly coarse texture and depth, typically associated with fabric canvases. This conclusion involves observing the texture presented in the image and drawing from knowledge of textile properties commonly used in wall art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the comparison between Image A and Image B, the only notable change is the replacement of the mirror with the wall art. All other aspects, such as the sink, vase, lights, and tiles, remain consistent between the two images. Key visual identifiers of these components are consistent in both images, indicating no unexpected alterations outside the described edit.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the documented edits involve removing the mirror and replacing it with minimalist landscape wall art. The rest of the components in the scene remain unchanged, such as the lighting, sink, and vase, which match their original portrayal in Image A. Therefore, there are no extra alterations besides those described.",
