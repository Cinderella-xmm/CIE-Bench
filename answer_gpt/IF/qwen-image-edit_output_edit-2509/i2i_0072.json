      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a stylized manner with smooth contours, vibrant colors, and simplified features typical of 3D cartoons.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "Comparing the poses between Images A and B, the body orientation, legs, and arm positioning are consistent, indicating that the original pose has been maintained.
