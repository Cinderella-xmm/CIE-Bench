    "Question": "Q4: Does the edited image maintain a professional and relevant look for a hairdressing tools brand ad?",
    "explanation": "Image B has added the words 'Sharp' and 'Clean' with a stylized sketch design that could convey creativity. While it adds an artistic flair, the sketch style with handwritten text might not align with the sleek professionalism typically expected in advertising high-end hairdressing tools, which often favor a more polished and sleek appearance. Thus, it may not entirely fit the criterion of looking professional in that specific industry.",
