    "Question": "Q1: Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the object is visually identifiable as an owl. Its distinctive features include an owl-shaped body, mechanical feathers, and a head adorned with a crown, which contrasts the original teapot form in Image A with its spout, lid, and handle.
