        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts an interior resembling a castle hall with stone walls, archways, and classic lighting. This setting is distinct from the modern interior in Image A, which prominently features a large wall clock. The absence of any wall clock in the stone hall environment of Image B indicates that the wall clock is no longer visible after the edit.",

      "question": "Is the wooden cabinet still visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a medieval or historical castle hall setting with stone walls and gothic architecture, which is entirely different from the contemporary interior design in Image A that includes a wooden cabinet. Given the architectural style of Image B, there is no wooden cabinet visible, as it would not match the aesthetic or function within this type of hall.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly showcases elements commonly found in castle hall interiors, which include stone walls, high arches, and an overall gothic architectural style. These features are characteristic of historical castles and are prominently displayed in the image.",

      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image match the lighting style from the original image, with similar shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the lighting is bright, casting clear and sharp shadows due to what appears to be direct sunlight in a modern interior setting. Image B features ambient lighting typical of a castle hall, potentially featuring candlelight and softer natural lighting from windows, resulting in diffused shadows and a warm glow. The lighting styles between the two images are thus quite different.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, depicts a castle hall setting with historical architectural features, and no decorative objects such as vases or plants are visible. This contrasts with Image A, which contained modern decor elements such as vases and plants. Therefore, these objects from the original scene do not appear in Image B.",
