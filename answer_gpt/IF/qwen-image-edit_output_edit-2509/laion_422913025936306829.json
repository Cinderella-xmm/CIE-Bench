      "question": "Does the edited shirt design use vibrant, saturated colors typical of pop art rather than subdued or earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt showcases bright and vibrant colors like electric blue, hot pink, and lime green that are typical of pop art style, in contrast to subdued or earthy tones.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are large, solid-colored sections used to define the muscular figure’s anatomy, such as chest, arms, and legs, replacing fine shading or gradient effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the muscular figure's anatomy with large, solid-colored sections, particularly in areas like the chest, arms, and legs. This approach is more graphic and stylized, replacing the more detailed shading and gradients present in the original design, resulting in a flat, comic-style appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the edges of the figure and surrounding elements consist of crisp, angular, or straight lines rather than flowing or organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges around the figure and the surrounding elements appear to be stylized with crisp, angular lines. This style diverges from the more organic and flowing curves seen commonly in traditional artwork, creating a modern, bold outline that complements the overall pop art aesthetic.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns that were once subtle or gold-toned in Image A are now depicted in bright, neon colors like electric blue, hot pink, and lime green in Image B. This transformation heightens the visual impact, aligning with the pop art style’s preference for vivid and fluorescent hues.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains repeated, stylized patterns throughout the shirt's design. These include dynamic motifs consistent with the energetic and repetitive nature of pop art patterns, which often incorporate such elements to create rhythm and movement in the design.",

The basic anatomy and posture are preserved, allowing viewers to recognize the figure's form and stance, maintaining clarity amidst the colorful alterations.",
