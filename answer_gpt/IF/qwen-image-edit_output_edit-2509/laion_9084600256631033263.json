      "question": "Has the body of the car been transformed into a sleek, silver glass bottle that reflects the original car's curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a decanter is present which is designed with sleek, silver glass. The shape of the decanter is more angular and elegant, typical for high-end glassware. Image B does not depict a car or the transformation of a car into a decanter. Therefore, there is no evidence that the body of a car, particularly the Datsun car from Image A, has been transformed into a glass bottle in Image B.",

      "question": "Have the original headlights been replaced with faceted glass stoppers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a glass bottle stopper can be seen which seems to replace the role of headlights conceptually if anthropomorphizing the object. However, faceted glass tops are a common feature of decanters and the transformation of headlights into such stoppers is not visually depicted. Image A featured a car with traditional headlights, and there is no direct transformation shown. Thus, it cannot be claimed that headlights have been replaced with glass stoppers in Image B.",

      "question": "Is there a chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid on top of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stopper on top of the decanter in Image B is depicted as a clear and sleek glass stopper without any gear-shaped design or chrome finish. The visual cues reflect sophistication typical of luxury decanters but do not indicate any gear-shape or chrome finish. Thus, based on the appearance of the stopper, a chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid is not present.",

      "question": "Is the Datsun 1600 emblem embossed on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design on the front of the decanter features an intricate label with the text 'Thank you' and pictorial elements that appear to resemble a vintage styling, in scripts commonly used in branding labels. The Datsun 1600 emblem seen on the car in Image A is not visible or represented on the decanter in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the decanter design combine vintage styling (such as classic curves or script) with modern branding elements (such as clean lines or minimalist text)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the decanter features a vintage-style label with ornate details and script, reflecting classic design elements. The glass is clear and has clean and sophisticated lines typical of modern design, blending old-world charm with contemporary elegance. This combination of elements suggests that the decanter indeed merges vintage styling with modern branding techniques.",
