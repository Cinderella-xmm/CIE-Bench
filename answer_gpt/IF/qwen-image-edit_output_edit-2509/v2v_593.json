        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of what appears to be a Funko Pop-style box with a chibi kangaroo figure visible inside. The box is shown in an isometric perspective, which is a common style for product packaging illustrations. From common knowledge, the geometric, angular depiction with the recognizable Pop branding aligns with a Funko Pop box design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) includes a chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box. The design style is characteristic of Funko Pop figures, with simplified features and a stylistic approach. The kangaroo has a pouch and is placed on a grassy base, which suggests a thematic link to its hopping nature.",

      "explanation": "In Image A, the kangaroo is depicted in a realistic setting, hopping along a path in a natural environment. Image B has shifted from a realistic setting to a stylized product representation, with the kangaroo depicted as a chibi figure inside Funko Pop-style packaging. The original pose and natural setting have not been maintained.",
