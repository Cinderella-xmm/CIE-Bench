      "question": "Are the vegetables in the dish visibly smaller than they were in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables appear to be a mix of smaller and similarly sized pieces compared to Image A. The broccoli and cauliflower in Image B seem to have smaller florets added among the original-sized ones. By observing visual cues, itâ€™s clear smaller elements are incorporated into the existing backdrop of usual-sized pieces, suggesting a reduction in some of their size or inclusion of smaller pieces.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the space between the vegetables increased due to their shrinkage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the appearance of some smaller vegetables, the arrangement still looks densely packed. The new smaller pieces are mixed among the original ones without notable space in between each, keeping a compact display. Space between the items hasn't visibly increased, indicating density is maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vegetables maintain their original shapes and colors despite being smaller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller vegetables still maintain the same green and white colors and the general floret shape of broccoli and cauliflower. Despite their reduced sizes, their color tone and recognizable shapes remain consistent with what is typically expected from these vegetables.",

      "question": "Is the size of the dish holding the vegetables unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dish in Image B visually corresponds to the one in Image A. The handles, edges, and depth display no noticeable differences. This indicates that the size of the dish remains constant between the two images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any new elements been added or existing elements removed besides shrinking the vegetables?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B features some vegetables that appear browned in colors similar to roasted or cooked pieces within the raw mixture that were not in Image A, suggesting the addition of either cooked or different types of vegetables pieces. Therefore, the visual cues indicate a modification in addition to merely shrinking.",
