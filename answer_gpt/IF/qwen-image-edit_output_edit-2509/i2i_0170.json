      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines and contours appear sharp and precise.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inclusion of the Vogue-style text overlay in Image B adds an element typical of high-end commercial imagery, aligning with visual cues often used in luxury fashion branding.
