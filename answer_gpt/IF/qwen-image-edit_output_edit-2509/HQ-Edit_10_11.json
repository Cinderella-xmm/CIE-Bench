      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the gorilla depicted as a wood-carved sculpture rather than a living animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest that the gorilla is not a living animal but rather a wood-carved sculpture. The entire body of the gorilla possesses a consistent wooden texture, characterized by smooth, flowing lines that mimic those typically found in carved wood art. These lines are uniformly spread across the body, displaying a lack of organic texture and color variation, reinforcing the wood-carved appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the contours of the gorilla's body defined using multiple shades of brown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits multiple shades of brown on the gorilla, which are indicative of a wood-carved sculpture. These varying shades provide depth and dimensionality, necessary for simulating a carved object. Additionally, these tonal differences contribute to a realistic representation of shadows and highlights, typical in carvings to show the intricacy of the work.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are detailed fur-like textures engraved into the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than detailed fur-like textures, the gorilla shows distinct, smooth engravings covering the entire surface that represent the wood grain effect. This lack of detailed fur texture, and instead, the use of engraved lines typical of wood carvings, confirms that the sculpture does not have detailed fur-like textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arms and legs of the sculpture visibly smoother than the rest of the body, lacking fine anatomical detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms and legs in Image B are consistent in texture and detailing with the rest of the body. They show the same engraved lines and absence of intricate anatomical details, signifying a smooth wooden surface rather than a realistic depiction. Therefore, there is no difference in detail between these parts and the rest of the body.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the leafy backdrop been replaced with an etched wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background now appears as a continuous wooden surface, with etched patterns that resemble artistic carvings rather than a depiction of natural foliage. The uniform color and pattern clearly indicate a transition from a leafy backdrop to an etched wooden surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there a few dark-toned leaf shapes integrated into the wooden background, matching the wood carving style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B includes dark-toned shapes that resemble leaves, integrated into the wooden surface. These shapes are consistent with the wood carving style, providing thematic continuity between the carving of the gorilla and the backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Does the gorilla maintain the same seated posture and hand placement as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the gorilla in Image B maintains the same basic posture and hand placement as in Image A. Though the textures and materials differ, the positioning of the arms, legs, and body have not changed, confirming consistency in posture.",
