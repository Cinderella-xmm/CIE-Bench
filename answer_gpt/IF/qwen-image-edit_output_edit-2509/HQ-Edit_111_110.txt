    "Question": "Q1: Are the bookshelf and books fully constructed from LEGO bricks instead of wood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf structure and books clearly resemble the modular appearance of LEGO bricks. The uniformity and block-based construction visible in the image are typical of LEGO builds, showing seams and interlocking parts. There is no appearance of wood grain or irregularities associated with wooden materials, confirming they are made from LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are all books represented as individual LEGO blocks in earthy tones (e.g., brown, tan, terracotta)?",
    "explanation": "The books on the shelves in Image B are depicted using rectangular shapes that conform to the aesthetics of LEGO bricks. The color palette includes shades such as brown, tan, and terracotta, which aligns with the earthy tone theme. These characteristics suggest that the books are represented as individual LEGO blocks in the specified colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the intricate carvings on the original shelf and book spines replicated using darker LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no distinct intricate carvings visible on the bookshelf or the book spines as seen in Image A. The LEGO bricks do not replicate these carvings; instead, they form a simple, blocky structure. The absence of complex designs and the usage of uniform LEGO pieces indicate that the carvings are not replicated.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the LEGO tower narrow progressively toward the top, forming a tapered shape?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO tower having a distinct tapering shape. Each segment of the tower becomes progressively smaller as it ascends, resulting in a narrowing appearance towards the top. This architectural design is consistent with a tapered structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the surface of the LEGO structure smooth and plastic-like, lacking any wood grain or natural texture?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO structure in Image B exhibits a smooth and consistent surface typical of plastic materials, which is devoid of the irregular textures associated with natural wood grain. This reinforces the appearance of a man-made LEGO construction lacking natural texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the background plain and muted, without any patterns or textures, to highlight the LEGO structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is plain and features a muted, solid color. There are no patterns or textures present, allowing the LEGO structure to be emphasized without any distraction from the background. This minimalist backdrop highlights the detailed construction of the LEGO tower.",
    "answer": "Yes"
