    "Question": "Q2: Are there visible crystalline structures growing along the curved edges of the arch?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, there are numerous blue crystal-like formations attached along the curved edges of the rock arch.

    "Question": "Q3: Are there luminous, vein-like lines running across the surface of the arch that follow naturalistic branching patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, alongside the crystalline structures, there are vein-like luminous lines that emanate from the edge of the arch.

    "Question": "Q4: Has the original arch outline been replaced with skeletal, wing-like protrusions extending from the structure?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the structure of the arch itself remains largely visible, without being completely replaced by any protrusions. Instead of skeletal or wing-like features taking over the entire outline, there are crystalline extensions, but they do not form a skeletal, wing-like pattern.
