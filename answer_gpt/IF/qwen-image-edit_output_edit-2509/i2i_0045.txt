    "Question": "Q3: Does the composition of the edited image adhere to the golden ratio principles?",
    "explanation": "While assessing for adherence to the golden ratio, it's noted that Image B places the girl roughly in the center, with significant negative space on either side. The primary elements (the girl, the frisbee, and the horizon) do not specifically follow the traditional golden ratio guidelines, which typically involve more dynamic placements within the frame, so it suggests the composition does not use the golden ratio.",
