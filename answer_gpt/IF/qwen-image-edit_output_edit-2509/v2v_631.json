      "question": "Does the image feature warm tones and soft lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dominant colors are purple and black, which do not typically align with warm tones; warm tones are usually reds, oranges, and yellows. The lighting appears to be moderate but not notably soft, as the design has distinct contrasts between the character and the background along with clear borders. The image conveys more of a digital, polished look rather than a soft, warm aesthetic.",
