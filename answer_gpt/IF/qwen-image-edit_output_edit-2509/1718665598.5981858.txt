    "Question": "Q1: Are the elements of the scene (road, sky, trees, poles) fragmented into geometric shapes such as polygons, rectangles, and triangles?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the scene is fragmented into geometric shapes. The sky consists of polygonal patterns, the road is angular, and the trees and poles are simplified into geometric forms. Using knowledge of geometric abstraction in art, these shapes are commonly employed to stylize and simplify real-world scenes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the road composed of angular, non-smooth sections instead of a smooth, curving surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the road appears to be composed of angular sections, emphasized by sharp, straight lines. This contrasts with smooth curves seen in realistic depictions, indicating the artistic choice to use geometric abstraction for stylization.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the clouds represented as overlapping quadrilateral or polygonal shapes rather than soft, natural cloud formations?",
    "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are depicted using geometric shapes such as polygons and quadrilaterals, which differ from the soft, fluffy forms typically seen in natural cloud representations. This stylization through geometric abstraction is evident from the angular patterns used in the clouds.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the telegraph poles rendered in a stylized, geometric form using angular lines and shapes rather than realistic proportions and textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows telegraph poles that are simplified into geometric shapes, with angular lines devoid of the natural texture and subtle detail found in realistic images. This reflects a stylized approach using geometric forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the trees depicted as abstract triangular shapes rather than natural, rounded tree canopies?",
    "explanation": "The trees in Image B are represented as abstract shapes resembling triangles, breaking away from the rounded and variable structures typical of real trees. This method of depicting trees is consistent with the use of geometric abstraction in art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the image use only muted greens, grays, and deep yellows, avoiding bright or saturated colors?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a color palette dominated by muted greens, grays, and deep yellows. This subdued color scheme avoids bright and saturated tones, which is often used in artistic compositions to evoke specific moods or styles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a clear sense of depth and perspective in the scene, with the road leading toward a distant horizon despite the geometric abstraction?",
    "explanation": "Image B maintains a clear sense of depth and perspective, as the road leads toward a vanishing point in the distance, creating spatial depth. Despite the geometric abstraction, this aspect of depth is preserved, showcasing the artist's skill in combining abstraction with perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
