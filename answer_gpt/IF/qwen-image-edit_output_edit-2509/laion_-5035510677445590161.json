      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is wearing a tricorn hat, which is distinctively different from the traditional red Santa hat seen in Image A.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
