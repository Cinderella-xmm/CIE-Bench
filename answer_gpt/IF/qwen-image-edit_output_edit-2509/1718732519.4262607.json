      "question": "Is the hot dog replaced with a model made of red, yellow, and tan LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog looks like a construction made with LEGO bricks, clearly discernible by the characteristic interlocking notches and blocky texture typical of LEGO pieces. World knowledge of how LEGO structures appear informs the understanding that these visual cues identify LEGO bricks. This analysis, combined with the specific colors visible—red, yellow, and tan—leads to concluding affirmatively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the original bottle been replaced with a mosaic-style ceramic object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is clearly no longer a regular beverage bottle as seen in Image A; instead, it appears to be a ceramic piece in a mosaic style, identified by the colorful patterns constructed akin to mosaic art. World knowledge about mosaic glass or ceramic items helps recognize these patterns—combined with the noticeably different shape and design—confirming the object as a mosaic-style ceramic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece feature geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic ceramic piece displays multi-color patterns. Applying world knowledge of color recognition and geometric designs, the visible colors prominent are red, yellow, and tan among others. The geometric aspect of the mosaic is identifiable by sharp distinct shapes forming the pattern—a hallmark of mosaic artworks.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the LEGO hot dog and the mosaic ceramic piece placed on a smooth wooden base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the base of both items suggests a smooth wooden texture consistent with fine grain expected of polished wood, affirming their placement upon such a surface. Comparing this with Image A’s similar wooden base for the hot dog, the consistency in surface appearance supports this answer.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the LEGO hot dog maintain an elongated, cylindrical shape similar to a real hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the LEGO hot dog is visually longer and maintains a cylindrical approximation despite blocky construction, adhering to the typical appearance one expects of a hot dog. World knowledge of basic hot dog shapes helps validate this comparison—albeit in LEGO form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the mosaic ceramic piece have a rounded, artistic form rather than a realistic bottle shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's ceramic object exhibits a rounded, artistic contour distinct from pragmatic shapes like beverage bottles. The artistic form seems organic and aesthetic—a contrasting factor from functional everyday bottle contours, validated by world knowledge of artistic sculpture shapes.",
