    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the entire cruise ship been replaced with translucent, iridescent crystal structures that resemble a palace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure resembles a palace made of translucent crystal rather than a traditional cruise ship. The structure has domes and towers typically seen in palatial architecture, combined with the reflective quality of crystal, which indicates that the ship has been replaced with this palace-like form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the hull been replaced with clear, angular, and faceted crystal structures rather than a smooth, solid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure that features angular and faceted elements characteristic of a crystal. These elements deviate from the typical smooth, solid form of a ship hull, indicating that the hull has indeed been replaced by crystalline forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all windows been transformed into multifaceted gem-like elements with visible facets and reflective properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'windows' in Image B are visible as multifaceted and reflective elements similar to gemstones, as opposed to the flat and non-reflective windows found on a typical ship. This suggests a transformation into gem-like features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the decks been replaced with intricate, transparent crystal pathways featuring detailed patterns or latticework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the structure shows intricate patterns and detailed latticework typical of crystalline or icy architecture, instead of solid ship decks. This indicates a replacement with crystal pathways.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been simplified to a minimalist horizon with no visible islands or complex terrain, emphasizing the crystal ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a background consisting of a simplistic horizon, void of the islands and terrain visible in a typical ocean scene, focusing attention on the crystalline structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there strong visual contrast between the shimmering, iridescent crystal ship and the minimalist background, enhancing the perception of brilliance and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the minimalistic background increases the emphasis on the crystal ship, enhancing its visual impact against the plain horizon. This contrast amplifies the perception of brilliance and transparency of the crystal structure.",
      "weight": 1,
