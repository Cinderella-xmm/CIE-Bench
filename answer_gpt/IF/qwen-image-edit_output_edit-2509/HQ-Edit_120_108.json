      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B visual cues, the armature of the brass lamp is integrated with cogs and gears. This is evident as elements resembling mechanical gears are fixed onto the armature, seemingly contributing to its design and possibly its functionality, aligning with steampunk aesthetic. Common knowledge of engineering and design confirms that these components suggest a mechanical nature or aesthetic.",

      "question": "Do the book's pages display mechanical schematic designs with cog-like margins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the open book's pages feature mechanical schematic designs and borders resembling cogs or gears. This implies the book might contain technical illustrations, in accordance with a steampunk theme. Mechanical schematic designs are known to include detailed line work and geometric figures, matching the visible patterns. The detailed illustrations and border work reflect typical design elements.",

      "question": "Are rivet patterns present on the floral wallpaper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows rivet patterns in the background and they are integrated into a wall panel design that does not resemble floral wallpaper but instead metal panels with visible rivets. Examining Image A, the original background is floral wallpaper, so the comparison highlights a significant change from a floral to an industrial aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the overall colors of the image dominated by warm tones such as brass, brown, and amber, consistent with a vintage leather-and-brass palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, warm tones such as brass, brown, and amber are dominant, creating a vintage leather-and-brass palette. Such colors are generally associated with a classical, retro aesthetic, complementing the steampunk theme as brass and leather elements are historically linked to industrial design. Similarly, Image A is dominated by warm tones; however, it emphasizes an antique ambiance with floral textures. Comparing both, the palettes are consistent in their warmth but differ in thematic emphasis.",

      "question": "Is the lamp still casting a focused beam of light directly onto the open book, maintaining the original lighting setup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B analysis shows the lamp casting light directly onto the open book, similar to Image A. The lighting focuses on the book, accentuating its details - common for reading lamps designed to illuminate reading material effectively. Although both images share this setup, Image B's lighting is adapted to highlight the mechanical designs, maintaining concentrated lighting marked by the lamp's position and focus.",
