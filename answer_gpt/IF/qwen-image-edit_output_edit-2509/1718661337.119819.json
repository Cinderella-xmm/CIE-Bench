      "question": "Is the officer wearing a brown leather trench coat instead of the original naval uniform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the officer is visibly wearing a brown leather trench coat adorned with brass and gear-like embellishments, instead of the traditional blue and gold naval uniform seen in Image A. The leather texture and color, as well as the distinguishing design elements of the coat, confirm the switch in attire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows multiple brass gears and mechanical components attached to the officer’s clothing, enhancing the steampunk aesthetic. These mechanical elements are not present in Image A, where the officer wears a standard naval uniform.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the object in the officer's right hand a chronometer-like gadget instead of a bell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object held by the officer resembles a chronometer or a steampunk-inspired gadget, featuring gears and a dial, as opposed to the simple bell held in Image A. The different design and function of the object are indicative of the steampunk transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a fantastical background with several airships and floating cities, enhancing the steampunk theme. This is a significant change from the original Image A, which features a natural seascape at sunset without any such elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, goggles are distinctly visible on the front of the officer's tricorne hat, a classic element of steampunk attire. In contrast, Image A features a traditional tricorne hat without any such additions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the officer’s posture and facial expression remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The officer’s posture in both images appears largely unchanged, maintaining the same stance. However, without explicit context of facial expressions due to the blur, we assume the expression has remained consistent with the body language and overall presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall visual style of the image reflect Victorian-era steampunk aesthetics, including brass elements and mechanical design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates multiple elements of the Victorian-era steampunk aesthetic, such as the brass gears, mechanical designs on the clothing, goggles, and a background with airships and floating cities. This stylistic transformation from Image A supports the theme change conclusively.",
