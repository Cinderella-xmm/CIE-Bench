        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a single zebra standing on the green gradient plane. Visual inspection confirms the presence of only one zebra, with no additional zebras in the frame.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has all the grass been removed from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the snowy and tree-filled landscape visible in Image A is replaced by a uniform green gradient in the lower portion. This indicates that the original snowy ground has been replaced, while grass is not visually present at all.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the grass area replaced by a green gradient plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower part of the edited image features a green gradient plane, replacing the snowy ground seen in Image A. This is consistent throughout the area, indicating that the new plane substitutes the previous surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image introduces a zebra and alters the background to a green gradient, which can be seen as additional elements compared to Image A. These changes could introduce distraction, thus compromising the solitary and calm atmosphere.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A does not contain a zebra; its introduction in Image B indicates that the zebra is not preserved in terms of its position and appearance from Image A since it is absent there.",
