      "question": "Has the central structure been replaced with a digital billboard featuring luminous panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure appears to have been transformed into a digital billboard characterized by bright and vibrant panels. These luminous panels display a futuristic cityscape, indicating the presence of digital advertising or informational screens. In contrast, Image A shows a more solid structure resembling a monument or sculpture without any digital elements. The change from a static to a digital structure suggests the presence of luminous panels.",

      "question": "Are there visible dynamic neon animations on the digital billboard surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays neon-like colors and lighting effects on the digital billboard, giving the impression of dynamic animations or active visual displays, typical for digital screens showcasing movement and vibrant effects. The original image lacks these animated features, presenting a static sculpture instead. The presence of bright and colorful effects in Image B indicates dynamic neon animations.",

      "question": "Has the natural overgrowth been replaced with synthetic, glowing foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground cover appears to be glowing with an artificial, bright blue hue, contrasting with the natural greenery seen in Image A. This shift from organic vegetation to synthetic, neon-like plants suggests an intentional modification to depict a more futuristic or digital landscape.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original architectural angles and structural geometry preserved in the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, while the central structure has evolved into a digital billboard, the overall architectural geometry, such as the foundational base and upright angles, appears consistent with Image A's original structure. This suggests that the transformation maintains the architectural integrity despite the visual modifications.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings around the central structure appear polished with metallic facades, which convey a futuristic aesthetic. There are also holograms or digital overlays evident on the surrounding structures, adding layers of augmented reality elements, contrasting the more traditional and less digitally enhanced imagery of surrounding buildings in Image A.",
