      "question": "Is the image now depicting a box-like structure instead of a wall clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is clearly a rectangular box that houses a watch, as seen from its distinct corners and flat surfaces. There's a velvet interior, which is typical of watch or jewelry boxes, combined with a visible hinge mechanism which further supports the interpretation of it being a box. Unlike a wall clock, which lacks these features, the presence of these elements in Image B strongly indicates that it is a box structure.",
