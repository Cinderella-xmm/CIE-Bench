      "question": "Are bold, graphic lines used to delineate the outline and major features of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is outlined with distinct and bold lines which define its shape and features clearly. This stylistic approach creates a graphic and cartoon-like appearance, emphasizing the key elements of the cat, such as its ears, whiskers, and facial structure. This is a common technique in graphic design to enhance clarity and visual impact.",

      "question": "Are the sunglasses depicted in a flat, vibrant orange color without gradients or shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses on the cat are represented in a solid and vibrant orange hue with no shading or gradient applied. This approach aligns with a pop art or poster style, where flat colors are used to simplify and stylize the composition, maintaining uniformity and boldness in the appearance of the sunglasses.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the beach background composed of simplified, abstract color blocks rather than realistic scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a realistic beach scenery; instead, the background is composed of broad, flat areas of color that abstractly suggest elements like the sky, sea, and sand. This method transforms the background into a series of artistic color blocks, characteristic of abstract and pop art styles, which prioritize color over realistic detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both the harness and the shadow under the cat replaced with gradient fills?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the harness and the shadow under the cat utilize flat and solid colors without any gradient fill. The use of flat colors aligns with the overarching pop art style of the image, which relies on high contrast and minimal shading to convey form and dimension.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features red, blue, and yellow as flat, vibrant colors, used consistently to create a visually striking, high-contrast image. These colors are typical of pop art, contributing to its vivid and attention-grabbing style. They are applied without gradients, maintaining the boldness and simplicity characteristic of this artistic approach.",
