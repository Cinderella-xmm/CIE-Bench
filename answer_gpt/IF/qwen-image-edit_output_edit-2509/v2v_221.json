      "question": "Is the cow depicted in a stylized 3D chibi art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cow that exhibits characteristics typical of a 3D chibi art style, such as exaggerated features like large eyes and a playful expression. Chibi design often includes elements that make characters appear cute and cartoonish. The cow's large eyes, simplified forms, and the overall exaggerated look reflect this style.",

      "question": "Does the cow retain its original black-and-white coat patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cow's coat pattern in Image B remains black-and-white, similar to typical Holstein cows. The patterns are consistent with natural coloring, recognizable by patches of black on a white base, just like the cow in Image A. Despite the change in style, the color pattern continuity indicates that the original design elements are preserved.",

      "question": "Is the cow leaning against the vintage television with both front hooves placed atop the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow is clearly shown with both front hooves resting on top of the vintage television screen, suggesting interaction with the object. This differs from Image A, where the cow stands behind the TV without resting its hooves on it. The hooves' placement and posture in Image B support the idea that the cow is actively engaging with the TV in a playful manner.",

      "question": "Does the cow sport a mischievous grin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cow in Image B has a distinct expression characterized by a wide, open-mouthed grin, which conveys playfulness and mischief. The appearance of the grin, combined with large expressive eyes, creates a feeling of cheerfulness, which aligns with typical artistic portrayals of mischief in cartoon-style characters.",

      "question": "Is the scene set in a grassy field with a bright sky and a few 3D-modeled clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene with a grassy field and a bright sky, consistent with the elements typically found in outdoor settings. Unlike Image A, where the clouds appear photorealistic, Image B features clouds that appear to be 3D-modeled, showcasing a stylistic shift towards a more animated design. This confirms the transition to a stylized setting with deliberately modeled environmental features.",
