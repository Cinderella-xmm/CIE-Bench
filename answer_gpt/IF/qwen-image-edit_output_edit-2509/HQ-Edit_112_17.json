      "question": "Are all the original woodworking tools replaced with intricately detailed enamel replicas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools appear to be made from a polished, metallic material with enamel detailing, featuring smooth surfaces, uniform colors, and decorative elements that befit enamel replicas. In contrast, Image A showcases traditional woodworking tools made from worn metal and wood, with clear signs of use and aging. By examining the differences in material and surface characteristics, we can conclude the replacements are indeed enamel replicas.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hammer handle rendered in deep blue enamel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hammer handle as smooth and glossy with a deep blue hue, indicating enamel. This contrasts with Image A where the hammer has a wooden handle showing grain and wear. The smoothness and uniformity of the blue color suggest an enamel rendering in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hammer heads have a glossy metallic finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer head exhibits a shiny, reflective surface indicative of a glossy metallic finish, while Image A's hammer head is made of aged, weathered metal. The contrast in the surface qualities confirms the finish in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the wood shavings been replaced with delicate enamel curls in shades of amber and ivory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features decorative curls in amber and ivory colors that resemble art pieces rather than practical wood shavings. In Image A, the shavings are typical wood curls from carpentry work. Based on their appearance and the material shift, the wood shavings are indeed replaced with enamel curls.",

      "question": "Are the tools positioned on a textured linen fabric surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the tools over a textured surface that appears to be linen fabric, as evidenced by its weave structure and soft fabric appearance. Image A places the tools on a rustic wooden surface evidenced by its detailed grain and weathering. The notable change confirms the use of linen fabric in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric surface visually complement the polished appearance of the enamel tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smooth, refined surface of the linen fabric in Image B contrasts with the glossy, intricate details of the enamel tools, creating a complementary visual balance. The fabricâ€™s neutrality allows the enamel to stand out. Image A's wood grain does not offer such a complementary contrast with its tools, leading to the conclusion that the linen indeed complements the enamel tools in Image B.",
