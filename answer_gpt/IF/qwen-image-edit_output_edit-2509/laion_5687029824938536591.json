    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the shoe now rendered as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a fabric and rubber athletic shoe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture and appearance of the shoe suggests it is made out of wood. The brown coloration and visible grain pattern indicate it is a carved wooden sculpture, as opposed to the original athletic materials. This is deduced by the lack of fabric texture, typical shininess of rubber, and instead the presence of wood characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the panel shapes, lace paths, and branding details represented with deep grooves and visible wood grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe maintains its design shapes such as panels and lace paths, but these are represented with deep grooves typical of carved wood. The visible grain pattern supports the wooden sculpture depiction, which contrasts with the flat and uniform nature of athletic shoe materials in the original image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture use a combination of dark and light wood tones to represent the original black and gray coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the shoe entirely in a consistent brown wooden tone, without variations to mimic the black and gray colors found in Image A. The transformation into a wooden sculpture removes the color contrast found in athletic shoes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B seems to be a minimalist space with a simple, clean shelf. This enhances the focus on the shoe, supporting a gallery-like presentation. The uncluttered design emphasizes the carved shoe's artistic display.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presentation in Image B is indeed centered around showcasing the intricate carving and texture of the wooden shoe. Its texture and wood grain are highlighted through lighting and the minimalist setting, consistent with the artistic display typical in galleries.",
