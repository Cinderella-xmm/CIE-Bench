      "question": "Is the entire cat composed of crystal materials with no visible fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat appears to be composed entirely of crystal materials, indicated by the transparent and glossy texture visible throughout its body. There are no textures or patterns that resemble fur, which suggests the cat is crafted in a style simulating crystal materials.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the cat in Image B shows a mix of clear and somewhat darker areas which resemble the typical appearance of clear and smoky quartz crystals. The transparency and white cloudy aspects of the material suggest the use of these types of crystals.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colored areas that represent the calico patterns bear a resemblance to the glossy and opaque nature of obsidian. The patterns are distinctly dark, aligning with the typical colors of brown and black obsidian.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cat’s eyes as vibrant and opaque green, which are characteristics that align with how emerald crystals appear. The intensity and richness of the color suggest the use of emerald or a similar green crystal material.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Does the wooden block appear natural and polished, providing a clear contrast to the crystalline cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While comparing both images, Image A shows the cat with a conventional seated posture. In Image B, the same posture is preserved with the paws forward and the tail wrapped around the body. This confirms the likeness is maintained despite the change in material.",
