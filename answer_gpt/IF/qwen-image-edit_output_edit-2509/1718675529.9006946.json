    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image rendered in a stylized, graphic manner consistent with Art Deco design principles, rather than a photorealistic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits characteristics of Art Deco through its use of bold lines, geometric shapes, and symmetrical patterns. The simplification and abstraction of natural forms into stylized representations indicate a shift away from photorealism towards a more graphic and decorative approach. These are hallmark features of Art Deco design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ocean waves represented using bold, simplified geometric curves instead of naturalistic wave forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are depicted using large, sweeping geometric curves, contrasting with the intricate detail and flowing forms seen in naturalistic representations. This stylized approach helps to create a graphic look that emphasizes shape and form over realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted as stylized vertical lines without detailed fronds or natural tree structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B are shown as simplified, vertical forms, lacking the detailed, intricate frond structure typical of a naturalistic depiction. This stylization aligns with the overall graphic, Art Deco-inspired approach of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky rendered as symmetrical, geometric shapes rather than natural cloud forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are presented as rounded, layered shapes with a degree of symmetry, diverging from the irregular, fluid forms of natural clouds. This approach is consistent with geometric abstraction, a technique often used in stylized graphic art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use a color palette dominated by muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, avoiding bright or highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a color palette that prominently features muted tones of green, blue, and warm orange. These colors are subdued compared to bright or highly saturated alternatives, contributing to the image's Art Deco ambiance and stylized aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the essential elements of the beach scene—sand, ocean, horizon, and sky—still present and recognizable despite the stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the graphic stylization, Image B retains the core components of a beach scene: the sand, ocean, horizon, and sky are all distinguishable. Their presence and relative positioning ensure the scene remains identifiable as a beach, even within the abstract and decorative framework.",
