      "question": "Is the lime wedge positioned on top of the glass in a way that resembles a smiling cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime is placed at the top of the glass. The way the lime is split and positioned gives the impression of a cap sitting on the top of the glass. This appearance is often anthropomorphized in cartoonish images to give the object a character-like feel. Given this context, the lime does resemble a smiling cap.",

      "question": "Are two ice cubes positioned within the glass to resemble eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two ice cubes that are prominently shown near the top of the glass. These ice cubes are positioned alongside each other, which could easily give the appearance of eyes as part of an anthropomorphized character in illustration. The artistic style in Image B supports the idea that just two ice cubes could resemble eyes in a character.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sugared rim continues to create a consistent outline around the top of the glass. This outline, along with the placement of other elements (such as the lime and the ice), helps to form the impression of a facial feature, such as a grin. The complete and rounded sugared rim complements this notion.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an object that resembles a sombrero placed at the top of the lime, which is styled to represent a character on the margarita glass.
