      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the building's facade composed of visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks forming the overall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the building is composed of clearly visible, blocky LEGO-like bricks. The bricks are small and rectangular, typical of LEGO design, contributing to a distinctly artificial and playful look. This contrasts the realistic apartment building design typically seen in urban architecture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the building’s bricks rendered in muted red tones and the window frames in muted blue tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building’s facade features bright blue bricks and gray bricks rather than muted red tones. The window frames in the image appear to be gray or close in tone with the surrounding structure, rather than muted blue. This suggests an emphasis on vibrant LEGO colors rather than subdued hues commonly found in real-world architecture.",

      "question": "Have the climbing plants been replaced with green, segmented LEGO-style vines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the climbing plants have been replaced with a depiction of green LEGO-like vines. These vines are composed of segmented blocks designed to mimic real plant growth, matching the overall LEGO theme of the building. The artificial nature of the vines contrasts with the realistic plants typically seen on urban buildings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all balconies feature gray, blocky LEGO-style railings instead of realistic metal or decorative designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balconies are fitted with gray, blocky LEGO-style railings. Such railings are representative of a simplified, blocky design, departing from more intricate and decorative metal railings usually found in real-world structures. This aligns with the LEGO aesthetic which favors simplicity and uniformity over decorative complexity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform that contrasts with the surrounding environment to highlight its blocky aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO building situated on a flat, simple platform. This platform acts as a base for the LEGO structure, contrasting with the real-world element seen in Image A by emphasizing the blocky, orderly aesthetic typical of LEGO models. The flatness of the platform further enhances the distinct separation and playful contrast with any realistic environment.",
