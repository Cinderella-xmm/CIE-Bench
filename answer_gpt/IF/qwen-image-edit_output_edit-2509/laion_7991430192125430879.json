      "question": "Is the entire bottle constructed entirely from LEGO bricks, with no realistic glass or plastic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual inspection of the bottle reveals that it appears to be composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with no visible glass or plastic elements, as indicated by the texture and shape consistent with LEGO construction. This is evident through the block-like structure and shiny surface common to LEGO bricks. World knowledge confirms that LEGO sets can be assembled to imitate various items using solely LEGO bricks, supporting the observation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body and sides of the bottle built using translucent green LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle that has a somewhat transparent appearance. The LEGO bricks used on the bottle's body and sides are visually translucent green. Common sense tells us that LEGO often includes transparent pieces in their sets. This observation of translucent components in green indicates that the bottle employs such bricks.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the label area composed of multicolored LEGO blocks representing the original design elements (logo, text, colors)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the label area shows a colorful arrangement of LEGO bricks. The colors and patterns formed by these bricks mimic an abstract representation of the original label's elements, such as logos and text suggesting a creative adaptation seen in LEGO designs. This implies an artistic representation rather than an exact replication of the label.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cap made from smooth, circular blue LEGO bricks and does it maintain a cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B appears to adhere to the cylindrical shape with a vivid blue color evident. LEGO bricks have variations that allow for curved constructions, and this cap showcases a build that imitates the original bottle cap's structure. Observing LEGO's building principles, round pieces can effectively emulate cylindrical shapes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO bottle placed on a minimalist white shelf against a neutral or white background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the context around the bottle shows it positioned on a plain white surface, consistent with the description of a minimalist shelf. The backdrop also appears neutral, possibly to highlight the LEGO bottle distinctly. White or neutral settings oftentimes enhance the visual appeal in displays, supporting this conclusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all brand texts (e.g., \"Bacardi,\" \"Mojito,\" \"Classic Cocktails\") visibly rendered in blocky LEGO-style lettering and legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texts 'Bacardi' and 'Mojito' are distinctively visible in LEGO-style blocky lettering but integrated within the design using colored bricks and third-party design aspects that maintain legibility. The unique texture is indicative of LEGO's building patterns for textual representation, supporting the visual observation of 'blocky LEGO-style' lettering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO bottle display clear sculptural features such as defined edges, depth, and 3D form to emphasize its construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays distinct sculptural features such as well-defined edges and the depth provided by the LEGO blocks. The 3D appearance of the bottle is consistent with LEGO creations which often use various block shapes to create depth and structural form even when replicating real-world objects. The strong visual cues, like clear edge definition and dimensional construction, emphasize these features.",
