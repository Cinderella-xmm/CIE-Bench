      "question": "Is the word “Draft” written in a handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' appears to have characteristics resembling handwriting, with cursive and flowing strokes that are common in handwritten style fonts. Handwritten fonts typically emulate the natural variability found in handwritten text, such as uneven thickness and slanted characters, which is evident here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the word “Draft” placed on the yellow paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is distinctly positioned on a rectangular yellow shape that appears to be a piece of paper. This placement is evident as the text lies directly over the yellow background, making it an integral part of the paper's surface.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question": "Does the image resemble a design sketch cover focused on presenting the word “Draft”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a sketch-like appearance with rough lines and shading, which are typical features of design sketches. The focal point is clearly the word 'Draft', as it is prominently displayed and centered on the yellow paper. This presentation style is often used in concept or draft sketches to emphasize key elements or ideas.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is large, bold, and has sufficient contrast against the yellow background, making it easy to read and visually accessible. Legibility is ensured through clear, unambiguous lettering, which is crucial for effective communication through text.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Aside from the yellow paper and the word 'Draft', Image B includes a blue pencil and a laptop, indicating a workspace or design setting. These elements contribute to the context and narrative of the image, suggesting activities related to writing and drafting.",
