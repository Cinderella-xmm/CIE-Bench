    "Question": "Q1: Is the wall clock still visible after the edit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts an interior resembling a castle hall with stone walls, archways, and classic lighting. This setting is distinct from the modern interior in Image A, which prominently features a large wall clock. The absence of any wall clock in the stone hall environment of Image B indicates that the wall clock is no longer visible after the edit.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the wooden cabinet still visible in the edited image?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a medieval or historical castle hall setting with stone walls and gothic architecture, which is entirely different from the contemporary interior design in Image A that includes a wooden cabinet. Given the architectural style of Image B, there is no wooden cabinet visible, as it would not match the aesthetic or function within this type of hall.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the lighting in the edited image match the lighting style from the original image, with similar shadows and highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the lighting is bright, casting clear and sharp shadows due to what appears to be direct sunlight in a modern interior setting. Image B features ambient lighting typical of a castle hall, potentially featuring candlelight and softer natural lighting from windows, resulting in diffused shadows and a warm glow. The lighting styles between the two images are thus quite different.",
