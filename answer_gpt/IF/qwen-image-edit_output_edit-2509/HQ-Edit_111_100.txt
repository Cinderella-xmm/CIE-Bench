    "Question": "Q1: Is the warrior statue composed entirely of LEGO bricks, with visible brick-like elements forming its body, limbs, and head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue appears to be constructed from visible, interlocking brick-like elements, a characteristic feature of LEGO bricks. The entire structure, including body, limbs, and head, has a distinctive brick pattern. This observation aligns with the characteristic appearance of LEGO constructions, where individual bricks are discernible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the primary colors used in the statue limited to shades of brown and tan?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO statue predominantly features shades of brown and tan throughout the structure. These colors are typical for representing wooden or earthy tones in LEGO models, and the overall visual theme remains consistent with a limited color palette.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the armor sections (such as chest plate, shoulder pads, and leg guards) made of smooth LEGO bricks without surface texture?",
    "explanation": "The armor sections in Image B are constructed using LEGO bricks that have slight texture details due to the brick construction, rather than being completely smooth. LEGO constructions naturally have a grid-like surface because of the interlocking nature of the bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental details such as the headdress, necklace, and carvings on the torso created using textured LEGO bricks with visible patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details like the headdress, necklace, and carvings appear to be made with LEGO bricks that have patterns created by the arrangement of the bricks themselves. This gives a textured appearance typical of LEGO models where patterns emerge from the brick configuration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue positioned on a plain white pedestal with no decorative elements, located in a gallery environment with framed artworks on the walls and track lighting overhead?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the statue visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, with no continuous surfaces resembling carved wood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the statue is visibly constructed from interlocking LEGO bricks, evident in the brick-like texture across the statue's surface. There are no continuous surfaces that resemble carved wood, indicating a departure from the smoothness seen in the wooden statue of Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
