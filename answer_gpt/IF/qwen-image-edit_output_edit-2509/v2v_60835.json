      "question": "Have the cheetahs' leg joints been replaced with polished brass pistons and gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs' leg joints display elements resembling machinery, such as pistons and gears, commonly associated with a steampunk aesthetic. This is characterized by visible polished brass components, which visually align with the description of pistons and gears. By drawing on knowledge of typical machinery design, it is evident that these elements have replaced the natural joints of the cheetahs.",

      "question": "Has the cheetahs' spotted fur been partially replaced with tooled leather and copper plating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, patches on the cheetahs' bodies appear to be covered with materials that resemble tooled leather and copper plating. These elements are not typical of a cheetah's natural fur, which is usually uniformly spotted. The visual contrast between the mechanical additions and the fur indicates that some areas have indeed been replaced by these materials, characteristic of a steampunk style.",

      "question": "Have the cheetahs' eyes been replaced with glowing amber lenses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the cheetahs are presented as glowing, with an amber hue, suggesting a visual modification typical of a steampunk design. This glowing effect is not a natural characteristic of animal eyes, which supports the conclusion that their eyes have been transformed into amber lenses, reflecting technology-inspired alterations.",

      "question": "Are there towering, fantastical clockwork structures visible in the distant savanna horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts large, intricate structures on the horizon that resemble clockwork towers, with elements like gears and clocks visible on their facades. These structures are atypical of natural landscapes, indicating a fantastical, possibly steampunk-inspired, world. Their presence is a significant alteration from what would normally be expected in a savanna, which lacks such engineered constructs.",

      "question": "Is the sky streaked with coppery clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted with clouds that have a distinctive coppery hue, differing from the more common grays and whites seen in natural cloud formations. This coloration aligns with a steampunk aesthetic, emphasizing metallic tones, and suggests an artistic choice to fit the overall theme presented in the edited image.",
