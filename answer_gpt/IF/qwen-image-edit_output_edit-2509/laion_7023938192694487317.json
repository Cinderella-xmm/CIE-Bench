      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the individual's torso and attire rendered as an oversized figurine with exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso and attire are presented in a manner that suggests a bust or figurine-like structure, complete with a stand at the bottom, which typically indicates exaggerated proportions for a display object rather than realistic human proportions. The shoulders and chest appear slightly exaggerated to give a figurine feel or aesthetic.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figurine wear a stylized athletic jersey that differs from the original realistic shirt design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire appears to be heavily stylized, focusing on contour and form over fabric texture or realistic clothing drape, commonly used in figurines to emphasize design rather than real clothing fit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Craft\" logo visibly emphasized with increased size, brightness, or contrast compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the 'Craft' logo is visible on the shoulder, but it does not appear to be altered in size, brightness, or contrast compared to its appearance in Image A. Therefore, no visible emphasis exists beyond the original presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt material looks like it has a matte-finished polymer appearance, typically found on figurine surfaces, without the shine or texture indicative of fabric, enhancing the figurine aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the logo rendered in elevated, bold tones (e.g., bright red, white, blue) that contrast sharply with the black shirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo's colors are indeed vibrant and bold, especially the red, white, and blue components, contrasting starkly against the matte black appearance of the shirt, which is consistent with figurine design practices.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a detachable base beneath the figurine that resembles a sleek, contemporary stand made of polished metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the torso placed on a base that resembles a sleek, contemporary stand. This appears polished and metallic, typically used for displaying figurines, suggesting the base could be detachable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the base exhibit a subtle reflection consistent with polished metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B exhibits a subtle reflection indicative of polished metal, reflecting light much in the way metal surfaces do, suggesting it is indeed a polished metallic stand.",
