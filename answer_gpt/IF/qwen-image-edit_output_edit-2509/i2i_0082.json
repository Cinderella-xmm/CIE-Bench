      "question": "Has the clock been designed with a metallic material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock exhibits a shiny surface around the outer frame, typical of metallic materials, and a reflective quality often associated with metal. The texture and appearance suggest metal, which is visually different from non-metallic materials like plastic or wood, covered in Image A with a wooden frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the badge pendant preserve the minimalist circular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a circular frame surrounding the clock face with a simple and uncluttered design. The slender lines marking the hours further emphasize a minimalist aesthetic. Comparing this with Image A, a similar simple circular frame is observed, reinforcing the preservation of the minimalist style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the proportions of the clock hands been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands maintain the same relative lengths and design as visible in Image A. The hour hand is shorter than the minute hand, and this proportional relationship seems to be unchanged, ensuring accurate time representation and aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible feature such as a loop or hook indicating the pendant can function as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly features a loop at the top of the frame, consistent with designs meant for attaching to keychains. The loop is a recognizable element used to signify attachability, which is absent in Image A, suggesting its addition for the function of a keychain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no additional elements besides those necessary for converting it into a metallic badge pendant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B shows the addition of a loop to convert the clock's functionality to a keychain style; other than this, no extra decorative or functional elements, like engravings or embellishments, are added. Image A lacks this loop but shares the minimalist style, confirming only necessary modifications were made.",
