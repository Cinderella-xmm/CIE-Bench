      "question": "Are the pastries depicted with exaggerated, bright colors and bold outlines characteristic of pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases pastries with vivid, unnatural colors and thick outlines that resemble pop art style. Pop art is known for its use of bold, eye-catching colors and defined lines to create stylized representations, often making everyday objects appear striking and unconventional. The pastries in Image B fit this description by adopting bright hues and clear, bold outlines, contrasting with how they're commonly depicted in natural colors.",

      "question": "Do the bread slices feature bold outlines and vivid, non-naturalistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slices are shown with bright colors that aren't typically found in real bread and thick outlines, which deviate from the more natural appearance of bread. This stylization with such colors and outlines contributes to a playful, artistic representation rather than a realistic depiction. This approach is typical in pop art, which often aims to transform typical objects into visually striking pieces.",

      "question": "Are the muffin liners replaced with distinct geometric patterns such as triangles, squares, or other regular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays muffin liners with geometric patterns, including triangles and squares, which differ from the typical plain or patterned muffin liners in Image A. These geometric designs enhance the artistic and vibrant appeal of the muffins, adhering to a stylistic approach where geometric shapes convey a sense of abstraction and artistic flair.",

      "question": "Are the wooden trays replaced with a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the trays have adopted a checkerboard design with various bright colors instead of the wooden texture seen in Image A. The checkerboard pattern introduces a highly visual element that aligns with themes of pop art, enhancing the dynamic and bold presentation of the pieces displayed on the trays.",

      "question": "Have the background cups been replaced with abstract, colorful, non-representational shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has changed from the realistic depiction containing cups to colorful, abstract shapes that do not resemble any particular real-world objects. These shapes add to the artistic and abstract theme, using vibrant colors and non-representative forms to achieve an aesthetic synonymous with abstract art rather than realistic representation.",
