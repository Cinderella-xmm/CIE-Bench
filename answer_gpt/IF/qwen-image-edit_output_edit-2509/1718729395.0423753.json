      "question": "Does the image exhibit dramatic lighting with strong contrasts between light and shadow, typical of Baroque art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an evident dramatic lighting that creates strong contrasts between the illuminated areas and the shadows. The light appears to be coming from above and to the side, casting shadows that add depth and drama to the scene. This lighting approach is characteristic of Baroque art, known for its dramatic use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) to create a sense of volume and emotion.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings do not feature visible gold accents along the feathers.
