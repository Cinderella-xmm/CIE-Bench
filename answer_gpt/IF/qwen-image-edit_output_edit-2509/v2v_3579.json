      "question": "Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of sushi pieces resembles a human figure with distinguishable head, torso, arms, and legs. The configuration closely imitates the typical shape and proportions of a human body by using sushi rolls in placements that simulate limbs and body parts. The visual cues such as spatial arrangement and relative positioning of objects help identify the form as a humanoid figure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays sushi as the components of the human-like figure, where one arm, specifically the one on the viewer's left side (assuming this is the figure's right arm), is raised vertically. This mirrors the common depiction of a person raising their arm, providing a clear spatial distinction between the arm and the rest of the body and conforming to the usual posture of an upright arm.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is identifiable coloring and positioning of sushi that completes the figure with two arms. The arm on the viewer's right side (the figure's left) is clearly attached to the torso through the placement of sushi pieces that align with where a humanoid figure's left arm would naturally be. The placement does not show unnatural disconnection or lack of arm representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two distinguishable sections at the lower half of the humanoid figure made from sushi, suggesting two legs. The sushi pieces are aligned vertically from the body downwards and are spaced apart, embodying the standard representation of two limbs separate from each other but part of the same lower body arrangement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head of the person figure represented by sushi pieces and distinguishable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top part of the sushi arrangement in Image B features a distinct section that resembles a head, positioned above the torso area. A circular sushi roll is placed where a head should logically be, which makes it easy to interpret as the head of the figure due to its round shape and placement at the top.",
