      "explanation": "In Image B, the hummingbird exhibits features that are not typical of a real bird. It has large, colorful wings and a body that is animated with luminescence and imaginative design. It includes fantasy-like elements such as glowing petals and vines emanating from the body, suggesting a transformation into an ethereal or magical entity, akin to a garden spirit. The combination of fantastical attributes makes it appear as a non-biological creature.",
