      "question": "Is the dancer depicted in a 3D chibi-style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To answer this, we observe the visual style of the dancer in Image B. It appears as a 3D dimensional model with exaggerated, cute proportions typical of chibi-style representations, such as larger head sizes relative to body proportions. This style is distinct from regular proportions seen in traditional illustrations or photographs and suggests an affinity with chibi representations recognizable in animations and figurines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dancer frozen mid-pose, accurately capturing their graceful movements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is in a dynamic pose, with arms and legs extended, characteristic of a mid-dance position. The capture of movement through the pose could be considered graceful, as it reflects typical dance positions meant to embody fluidity and elegance in motion. The portrayal does seem to capture the charm of dance, albeit in a stylized manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dancer positioned stepping through a glowing elliptical portal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is a clear elliptical structure surrounding the dancer, filled with gradient colors, suggesting it is a portal. The dancer is positioned within this portal, creating the illusion that they are stepping through it due to the dynamic pose and positioning within the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the portal's framework feature radiant hues of blue and purple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The portal seen in Image B possesses clear gradient colors transitioning between blue and purple hues. These colors are vibrant and luminous, enhancing the visual impact and giving a futuristic or ethereal quality characteristic of portals in various imaginative depictions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dancer extending their hand toward the viewer in a welcoming gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the dancer's hand is extended, the posture appears consistent with dance positions rather than a gesture specifically intending to welcome the viewer. The hand is part of the pose characteristic of the dance form rather than an intentional outreach to greet someone visually.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the composition arranged in a 2:3 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The aspect ratio of Image B appears to be more square-like rather than rectangular, suggesting it does not conform to a 2:3 ratio. The proportions of the dancer and portal suggest a centered, balanced composition reminiscent of a 1:1 ratio, commonly used for visual symmetry rather than rectangular dimensions associated with widescreen formats.",
