    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the building rendered with sharp, angular edges characteristic of a paper-cut art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the architectural elements indeed exhibit sharp and angular features typical of a paper-cut art style, such as clear-cut angles for the building's roof and facade lines. This is evident from the crisp lines and defined edges that resemble crafted paper shapes, suggesting a stylized representation rather than fluid curves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the window frames and plant motifs enhanced with visible gold foil-like accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window frames are filled with a gold tone, suggesting an enhancement that resembles the visual effects of gold foil. The plant motifs are depicted in monochromatic green shades and do not show any gold foil-like accents. Thus, only the window frames have visible gold foil-like accents.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the entrance awning colored in a bold crimson hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entrance awning is depicted with a bold crimson color, evident through its deep, rich red shade that contrasts against the cream and brown tones of the building. This distinct coloration matches the description of a bold crimson hue.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background of each postcard rendered with a textured cream-colored paper appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the background of each postcard as cream-colored with visual patterns that mimic the texture of paper, indicating a designed appearance of textured paper rather than a flat color or design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each postcard feature a geometric arch border around its edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each postcard clearly displays a geometric arch border, which consists of angular lines forming an arched frame around the postcard's edges. The presence of this design is consistent across all three postcards, indicative of a careful, structured border.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the postcards presented without any visible frame or border, maintaining a clean, borderless edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, each postcard has a visible geometric arch border that frames the image and does not show a clean, borderless edge. The border is an integral part of the postcard design in this presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there exactly three separate postcards displayed, each showing a variation of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts exactly three separate postcards, with slight differences such as the signage on the awning, demonstrating varying representations of the same hotel building. The three postcards maintain consistency in design while each offers a subtly different view.",
