        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warthog exhibits several fantastical and nature-integrated features, such as cascading waterfall-like textures for its mane, moss-covered tusks, leaf patterns covering its body, glowing eyes, and tree-like hooves.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tusks of the warthog are depicted with a vibrant green texture, reminiscent of moss, suggesting a nature-inspired transformation. In comparison, the tusks in Image A maintain a smooth and realistic appearance without any moss-like qualities.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the warthog with intricate leaf-styled patterns across its body, enhancing its appearance as a nature-integrated creature.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays several fungi growths along the warthog’s back, depicted as small, red mushrooms. These additions embed the creature within a whimsical, forest-like theme, which is absent in the original Image A where the back is free of such elements.",
