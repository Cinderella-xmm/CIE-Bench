      "question": "Has the map and the pins been transformed into a ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the map has a highly textured and segmented appearance reminiscent of ceramic tiles. Each section is distinctly colored and outlined, resembling the style of mosaic artwork. The pins also maintain their positions but appear to be tiles rather than the original pushpins, suggesting a transformation from paper and plastic to a ceramic mosaic style.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic artwork display bold patterns and rich textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays various bold colors and distinct, pronounced lines separating each section, typical of mosaic art. The textures are visibly rich and varied, giving the map a three-dimensional, tactile quality. This suggests that the image has intricate designs with bold patterns and rich textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the original layout and positioning of the map and pins been maintained in the mosaic artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B to Image A, both images show a similar geographical layout and the same color-coded pin positions, indicating that while the materials have changed to a mosaic style in Image B, the layout and positioning have been preserved.",

      "question": "Does the mosaic artwork convey a lively appearance through vibrant colors and dynamic designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic in Image B exhibits bright, contrasting colors that are more vibrant than those typically found on a standard paper map. The dynamic design of the tiles with irregular shapes adds to the lively appearance. Such vibrant colors and dynamic designs create an energetic effect, characteristic of engaging mosaic artworks.",

      "question": "Do the map and pins appear to be made of ceramic tiles rather than their original materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture and segmentation of the map appear to be composed of small, colored tiles rather than printed paper, and the pins have a consistent texture with the map, resembling ceramic tiles. This gives the entire composition the look of ceramic tile rather than paper and plastic.",
