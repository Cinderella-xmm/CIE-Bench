      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the character show a head that is significantly larger compared to its body, a common trait in chibi-style designs that contributes to a cuter and more exaggerated appearance.
