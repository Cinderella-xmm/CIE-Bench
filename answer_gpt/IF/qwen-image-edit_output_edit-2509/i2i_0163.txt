    "Question": "Q5:Do the lighting and shadows appear realistic and consistent with an outdoor setting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears bright and natural, complementing the outdoor camping environment. Shadows from the toasters and the folding table are consistent with sunlight angles typically found outdoors. Combining visual patterns with real-world light behavior, the lighting and shadows are convincing and coherent. This contrasts with the controlled artificial lighting observed in the indoor Image A.",
