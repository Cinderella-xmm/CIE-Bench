      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure exhibits precise proportions with lifelike fur details, which suggests a realistic representation of a bear. The fur appears textured and detailed, creating a vivid depiction of a bear.

      "question": "Does the bear figure have emotive eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the bear's face is blurred, the ears and overall posture suggest that the bear originally had striking and emotive eyes. Typically, such detailed models or representations are made with attention to emotional features, reflecting lifelike expressions through the eyes.",

      "question": "Is the bear figure placed on a desk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure is situated on what appears to be a desk, as evidenced by the presence of office-like elements such as paper, chairs, and arranged books in the background. The context and objects around the bear suggest an indoor setting consistent with a desk environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a realistic, scaled-down model of the backpack included in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack looks like a full-sized item rather than a scaled-down model. It is proportionate to the bear figure, indicating it is of normal backpack size rather than a miniature model. The detailed shadows and textures contribute to a sense of realism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit a casual, natural vibe typically associated with smartphone photography. The setting is indoors, and its structured background with focused lighting and placement of objects suggests a staged or professionally set-up scene rather than a spontaneous natural capture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear figure appears to focus on lifelike textures and realistic proportions rather than incorporating Japanese anime-style elements. The details of the bear's fur and body structure suggest a realistic interpretation more common in 3D renderings or realistic art rather than anime styling.",
