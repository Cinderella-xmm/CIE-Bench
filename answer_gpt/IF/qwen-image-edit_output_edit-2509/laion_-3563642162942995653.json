    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck composed of layered, reflective crystal planes resembling emerald and jade facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck displays surfaces that resemble facets seen in cut gemstones, displaying reflectivity and transparency typical of emerald and jade. The consistent translucency and optical effect across the body indicate its composition as crystal-like, giving it a visually unique appearance compared to usual solid-color surfaces.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wheels transparent and made of quartz with visible internal crystalline patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels appear clear and reflect light as crystal or glass would, suggesting transparency akin to quartz. The internal appearance shows complex light interactions typical of crystalline patterns, implying the presence of internal structuring within a transparent medium.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck placed on a smooth, white marble platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the truck atop a smooth surface with a white color and vein-like patterns often found in marble, suggesting that the platform indeed resembles this particular stone. Common sense dictates that the white surface with gray lines is a typical feature of marble design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cabin and body surfaces feature angular, faceted crystal planes that reflect and refract light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows surfaces of the truck that are not smooth but angular and reflect light multiple angles, mimicking the characteristics of faceted crystal planes. This can be seen across the cabin and the body, indicating that these elements are intentionally designed to create reflections and refractions characteristic of crystal accessories.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crystal truck maintain the original structural proportions and layout of the military truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure of the crystal truck in Image B aligns closely with the original truck in Image A in terms of overall shape, element positioning, and proportions. Despite the change in material appearance, the structural integrity and design layout appears preserved in the transformation.",
