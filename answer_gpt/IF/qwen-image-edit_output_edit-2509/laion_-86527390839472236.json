    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the object now a tall, rectangular glass vessel instead of a soft-sided suitcase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a tall, rectangular object that appears to be made of glass. The transparency and shine suggest it is more similar to a glass vessel, unlike the soft textured fabric in Image A, which characterizes a suitcase. The object's presentation and material distinctly differ from a suitcase, aligning more with a bottle-like appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the retractable handle been transformed into a metallic spray nozzle positioned at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks the retractable handle seen in Image A. Instead, the top features a metallic ring consistent with designs meant for perfume bottles, resembling a spray nozzle. This suggests a transformation from a suitcase handle to a bottle cap-like nozzle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the side and front panels now made of translucent purple-tinted material instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a purple-tinted, translucent design. The color and transparency indicate glass, contrasting with Image A's opaque navy fabric. This change indicates a significant transformation into tinted glass material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original seam lines preserved as embossed linear patterns on the surface of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any visible embossed linear patterns or seam lines akin to those in Image A. The surface is smooth and glass-like, diverging entirely from the design of the suitcase and showing no preservation of seams.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there an etched logo visible near the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B has visible markings near the top under the spray nozzle, which resemble an etched logo. Such logo placement near the top is typical for branding on perfume bottles, differing from Image A, where logos were on fabric surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Have the wheels been replaced with decorative caps at the base of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of Image B still features wheels, akin to those seen on Image A. They are not merely decorative caps but serve as functional design elements, maintaining consistency with the suitcase's wheels.",
