        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spider has undergone a transformation that gives it a mythical appearance. It possesses features such as stained-glass-like wings, a luminous orb in place of its abdomen, and golden filigree on its legs, which deviate from a realistic depiction of a spider.
