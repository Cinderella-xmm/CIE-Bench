        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow is illustrated with an explorer hat featuring a buckle on its head. This distinctive accessory gives the sparrow a recognizably adventurous appearance. This is not present in Image A where the sparrow's head is bare. The visual cues, such as a hat with a wide brim and buckle, are common indicators of an explorer's hat, supporting the conclusion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow is depicted with a backpack on its back, visible due to its distinct shape and the strap over the sparrow's shoulder. This backpack is typically associated with adventurers or travelers. In Image A, there is no backpack on the sparrow, which presents the sparrow in its natural form.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow has feathers that are depicted with a fluffy texture and colored in warm, earthy tones such as browns and tans.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a stylized map depicting a forest with tiny treasure icons held by the sparrow, replacing the original depiction's focus on oak leaves above the sparrow.
