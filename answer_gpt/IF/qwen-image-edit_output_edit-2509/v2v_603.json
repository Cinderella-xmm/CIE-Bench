      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Have the skiers been converted into 3D chibi-style characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skiers exhibit exaggerated proportions and simplified features that are characteristic of chibi-style art. The heads appear larger in relation to the body, and the details are minimized compared to realistic proportions, typical of a 3D chibi adaptation, which usually involves making characters appear cuter and more cartoonish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear of the skiers identical to those in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skiers in Image B are wearing similarly colored outfits and backpacks as seen in Image A. However, the edited image represents them in a chibi style with different proportions and more simplified shapes, which suggests modification in the detailing and potentially in the texture appearance of the clothing despite retaining the same general color scheme and style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the snowy forest setting been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features snow-covered trees and a foggy atmosphere that closely resembles the snowy forest setting depicted in Image A. These elements indicate that the setting structure and ambiance have been preserved despite the changes to the characters.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positions of the skiers and the layout of the trees in Image B reflect what is seen in Image A. Both images depict two skiers side by side, with snowy trees flanking them, indicating that the arrangement has been preserved.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B exhibit features typical of chibi art, such as larger heads relative to their bodies and minimized details, which aligns with the exaggerated and simplified style associated with chibi character designs.",
