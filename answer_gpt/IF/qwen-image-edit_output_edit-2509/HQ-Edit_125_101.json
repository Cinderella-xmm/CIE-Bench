      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly enclosed within a spherical glass boundary, indicative of a snow globe. The spherical shape and the translucency are typical characteristics of a snow globe setup. When combined with common knowledge of how snow globes are structured, where scenes are enclosed within a round glass or plastic dome, it becomes evident that this is intended to represent a snow globe.",

      "question": "Is there a 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe that replicates the leaping pose of the original dancer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a ballerina figure inside the snow globe. However, the pose she adopts is different from that of the dancer in Image A. The dancer in the original image is leaping through the air with arms and legs stretched out while inside the snow globe, the ballerina is posed in a typical ballet stance with one leg raised. This indicates that her pose does not replicate the leaping pose of the original dancer.",

      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and at least two other recognizable miniature Parisian landmarks present inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is clearly depicted within the snow globe, and there are additional structures resembling Parisian architecture close to it. With common knowledge of typical Paris landmarks featured in miniature forms like Notre Dame or other well-known buildings, at least two other structures besides the Eiffel Tower are visible, confirming their presence inside the snow globe.",

      "question": "Are there visible swirling snowflakes surrounding the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B display white elements dispersed throughout the sphere, surrounding the structures and the ballerina. These white particles resemble snowflakes seen in snow globes, where artificial snow is a common theme that circles around the enclosed scene, giving the impression of swirling snowflakes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the snow globe resting on a base made of bronze and glass, with visible engravings in French script?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a snow globe resting on what appears to be a bronze base, displaying decorative engravings. Common sense and worldly knowledge interpret the script as French, considering the Eiffel Tower's prominence and Paris-themed elements. This matches typical French styling in engravings and designs for themed snow globes.",
