    "Question": "Q3: Are the blue dragons shown breathing faint wisps of orange curry-scented smoke?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons are depicted blowing wisps of smoke. The smoke is white or light gray rather than orange. The use of world knowledge indicates that smoke can be colored differently based on context, but there's no visual or sensory evidence to suggest curry-scented smoke. Therefore, while they are depicted breathing smoke, the color or scent of it is not explicitly displayed as orange or curry.",
