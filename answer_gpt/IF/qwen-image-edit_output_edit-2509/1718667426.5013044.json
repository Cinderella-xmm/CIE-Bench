      "question": "Is the ogre depicted in a stylized cartoon form with exaggerated features and simplified anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre is depicted with exaggerated features, such as a large head, disproportionate limbs, and simplified anatomy. This stylized cartoon form typically involves bold lines, bright colors, and an exaggerated appearance that contrasts with more realistic depictions.

      "question": "Are the muscles of the ogre significantly exaggerated and simplified compared to the original realistic depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's muscles are depicted in a highly exaggerated and simplified form. The muscles are prominent, with a more uniform and less nuanced presentation compared to the realistic depiction, which features a detailed and more anatomically correct musculature. The simplified depiction is consistent with cartoon styles that prioritize dramatic expression over anatomical accuracy.",

      "question": "Does the ogre have a matte finish with no reflective surfaces and bold, thick outlines defining its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's appearance is matte with no reflective surfaces. The use of bold, thick outlines is typical in cartoon designs to define forms and make characters stand out, allowing for easier visual recognition. This contrasts with the more nuanced and detailed texturing seen in more realistic art styles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of the realistic spear seen in Image A, the ogre is holding a whimsical, oversized, non-metallic club. This club appears soft-looking and comical, resembling a foam or toy-like object often used to create a light-hearted or non-threatening impression in cartoon illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre is illustrated with a cape that is oversized and appears comedic in nature, with fluffy fur trim that is pronounced and visible along the edges. This addition enhances the exaggerated and characterful appearance typical of cartoon styles and contrasts with the lack of such a garment in the realistic depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's clothing is not visibly tattered or frayed like in the original image. Instead, the attire seems more intact and stylized, consistent with a cartoon depiction where clothing is simplified and designed to align with the exaggerated nature of the character, lacking the frayed and worn details present in the realistic image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre is depicted standing on a rocky base, which is an element that provides an environmental context typically seen in statues or collectibles. The base includes an engraved plaque with the text 'Mighty Ogre,' suggesting a titular or character label that adds narrative and stylistic context, absent in Image A.",
