      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles exhibit exaggerated and stylized features typical of toy or chibi-style designs, such as thick and rounded parts, simplified shapes, and minimal intricate details, giving them a cartoonish and playful appearance. This indicates a 3D chibi style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bicycles are painted in red, blue, beige, and black. In Image B, the bicycles are colored red, yellow, and black. Thus, some colors differ between the two images, especially noting the absence of blue in the second image and the yellow color present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bicycles include realistic design details such as chains, gears, and realistic tire profiles. In contrast, Image B's bicycles have simplified designs without such detailed features, presented with basic shapes and smooth surfaces. Therefore, Image B does not retain the original design details.",
