      "question": "Does the edited image contain two distinct panels depicting different scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see that the composition is divided into three separate panels. Each panel presents a different scenario or scene featuring various anthropomorphic tortilla chip and guacamole characters. This indicates that there are distinct separations to depict different parts of the storyline within the comic.",

      "question": "Is the largest tortilla chip depicted as an anthropomorphic character with a monocle and a curious expression, peeking around a corner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, there is an anthropomorphic tortilla chip character wearing glasses with a puzzled or sad expression, visible due to tears. The glasses could be mistaken for a monocle, but they are complete round glasses. The chip is not peeking around a corner but rather surrounded by shelves with jars. Thus, the character does not fit the description of having a monocle or a curious expression.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, the setting is indoors with shelves containing jars, resembling a pantry or a spice rack setup. The presence of jars suggests storage for spices or ingredients, supporting the idea of a kitchen or pantry-like environment.",
