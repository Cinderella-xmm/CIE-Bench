      "question": "Is the cathedral rendered as a miniature model made of warm-stained wood instead of stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral appears to be crafted from a material with a consistent warm-brown tone, which is indicative of wood. In contrast to the typical stone texture seen on cathedrals, this warm hue suggests a stained wood material. Miniature models are often created with wood due to its versatility and the ability to stain it into warm shades. The visual cues of the material's color and texture confirm that the cathedral is depicted as being made of warm-stained wood.",

      "question": "Is the wooden cathedral model enclosed within an ornate shadow box with visible framing and a transparent front?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual clues indicate that the wooden cathedral model is surrounded by a distinct frame with a visible border suggesting an enclosure. The concept of a shadow box involves a three-dimensional display case with a transparent front, often used for presenting and preserving delicate items. The visible frame around the model supports the idea that it is housed in a shadow box structure for display, which usually includes protective glass at the front.",

      "question": "Are the Gothic architectural details, including pointed arches, flying buttresses, and rose window tracery, visibly detailed and accurately represented in miniature form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature cathedral with intricate elements characteristic of Gothic architecture, like pointed arches, a detailed central rose window, and the semblance of flying buttresses. Such features are rendered with attention to detail, respecting the complex designs emblematic of Gothic style. This accurate representation in a reduced scale is common in models to maintain architectural authenticity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire cathedral model colored in warm stained wood tones, avoiding stone-gray or cold metallic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B reveals that the cathedral model throughout exhibits a uniform warm-brown hue typical of stained wood. This choice of color intentionally diverges from the cold, stone-gray or metallic tones found in actual Gothic cathedrals. The use of wood tones highlights the miniature and crafted nature of the model rather than replicating original stone materials.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there miniature pews and chandeliers visible inside the model cathedral?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the model's framework, there are details reminiscent of candid church interiors including rows which resemble pews and small hanging fixtures consistent with traditional chandeliers. These elements are in line with representing an interior space associated with religious settings, effectively mimicking the appearance of a church's interior decor in miniature form.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the depiction of Image B, there is a clock prominently placed on the facade of the cathedral. Additionally, towards the base and leading up to the structure, there are small figures along a path. These figures, in conjunction with the presence of the clock, suggest an interaction possibly related to time or related activities, potentially symbolizing movement to reflect a narrative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature figures in Image B are aligned on a path that terminates near the cathedral. Their stances and group formations are indicative of actions like processions or gatherings, which are typically associated with religious gatherings or ceremonies. These visual cues align with common depictions of religious devotion activities in artwork and models.",
