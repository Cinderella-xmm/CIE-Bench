    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle rendered as a translucent crystal sculpture with visible facets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle is crafted from a material that mimics translucent crystal, reflecting light with visible facets akin to a cut gem. The geometric, clear quality suggests a crystalline structure as opposed to the more granular and opaque appearance typical of sand.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there soft blue highlights visible on the surface of the crystal castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal castle in Image B features a shiny, glass-like appearance with a subtle blue tint, which is most likely due to soft blue highlights. These highlights are visible due to the light refraction and dispersion within the translucent material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all seashells been replaced with small, polished gemstones in pastel hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seashells from Image A have not been entirely replaced. Instead, there is a mix of both seashells and small polished gemstones in pastel hues. This suggests a transformation incorporating additional elements rather than a complete replacement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ocean depicted as a wave pattern etched into a frosted glass slab rather than flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean in Image B appears as a fixed, three-dimensional wave pattern situated within a solid, frosted material, rather than as fluid water. This visual effect is akin to an etched or molded glass surface, capturing the appearance of waves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits the edited scene within a display encased in clear walls and a simple, neutral base, typical of gallery settings designed to spotlight the items within. The edges of the display case are clean and unobtrusive, emphasizing minimalism.",
