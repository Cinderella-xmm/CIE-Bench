      "question": "Are the stork's feathers replaced with metallic plates, such as riveted or segmented metal surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stork's feathers appear to be crafted from metallic plates, displaying an industrial textured surface. This metal-like quality gives the impression of riveted or segmented construction, common in metalwork design. The texture contrasts with typical natural feathers, suggesting a transformed appearance more akin to mechanical plating. This observation, combined with common design elements found in steampunk aesthetics, supports the conclusion that the stork has been edited to have metallic plates.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the nest materials composed entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts instead of natural twigs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nest's structure around the stork consists entirely of cogs, gears, and mechanical parts rather than natural twigs. These mechanical components form a circular arrangement resembling the shape and pattern of a traditional nest, yet they are distinctly industrial. The visual cue aligns with steampunk design, which often incorporates such mechanical elements into the artwork.",

      "question": "Are copper-colored pipes visibly integrated along the roofline of the wooden house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases copper-colored pipes integrated prominently along the roofline of the wooden house. These pipes have a metallic sheen and follow the roof's contour, characteristic of steampunk design which often features such industrial elements. The presence of these pipes enhances the mechanical theme of the visuals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stork have visible mechanical joints at key limb connections (e.g., legs, neck, wings)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Image B stork features visible mechanical joints at key limb connections. These joints are characterized by metallic texture and segmented appearance, commonly found in mechanical constructs. They are evident at the stork's legs and neck, indicative of artificial and industrial design rather than natural anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a Steampunk style, with consistent use of mechanical components, metallic textures, and industrial design across both the stork and the house?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is adorned with consistent steampunk elements, including cogs, gears, metallic textures on the stork, and copper-colored pipes on the house. The integration of mechanical components and the industrial design style prevalent in both the stork and the house confirms the scene's rendering in a steampunk style. The cohesive use of such motifs is reminiscent of steampunk aesthetics.",
