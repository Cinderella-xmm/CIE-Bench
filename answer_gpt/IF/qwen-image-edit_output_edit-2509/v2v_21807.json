      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures in Image B are indeed simplified. The surfaces lack complex textures or shading and instead rely on basic colors and lines. Despite this simplification, the defining features of the clock tower and surroundings are preserved, making them easily recognizable. Cartoon art typically simplifies textures to focus on shape and color for clarity.",
