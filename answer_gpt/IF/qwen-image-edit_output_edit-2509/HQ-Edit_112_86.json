    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the main body of the teapot made of clear glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the teapot looks transparent and is made of glass, as indicated by the clarity and the visible reflection. Clear glass is typically transparent, allowing light to pass through without significant diffusion. This characteristic of clear glass is evident in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the teapot transparent, allowing visibility through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's body is clearly transparent, as evidenced by the ability to see through it and the reflected patterns on the surface it is placed upon. Transparency is a key feature of clear glass, further supported by the visible details and reflection in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there frosted floral patterns on the surface of the teapot that resemble the original engraved rose and leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays frosted floral patterns that closely resemble the engraved roses and leaves from Image A's original teapot. The frosted effect suggests a decorative pattern similar to engraving but achieved through glass frosting techniques.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the handle and spout made of tinted amber glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the handle and spout are depicted in a color that resembles amber, which is a warm, honey-like color. This appearance is consistent with tinted amber glass, as the spout and handle show an amber hue distinct from the clear body of the teapot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the teapot placed on a reflective mirrored surface showing a clear reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is placed on a surface that reflects its base, appearing as a mirrored reflection. This indicates that the surface is highly reflective, akin to a mirror's properties, where objects placed upon it are clearly visible in reflection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on the teapot retain the same level of detail and design as the original engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the engravings display intricate detailing with depth and relief, characteristic of metal engraving. In contrast, the frosted patterns on the glass teapot in Image B, while similar in design, lack the same level of depth and three-dimensional relief due to the nature of glass frosting. Therefore, while the design is similar, the level of detail is not as intricate as the original engravings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the teapot retain the original shape and proportions of the original metallic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the teapot retains similar overall dimensions and proportions in terms of the body shape, handle, spout, and lid. Despite the material change, the silhouette remains consistent, indicating retention of the original shape and proportions.",
