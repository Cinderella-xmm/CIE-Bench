    "Question": "Q4: Is there a visible feature such as a loop or hook indicating the pendant can function as a keychain?",
    "explanation": "Image B distinctly features a loop at the top of the frame, consistent with designs meant for attaching to keychains. The loop is a recognizable element used to signify attachability, which is absent in Image A, suggesting its addition for the function of a keychain.",
