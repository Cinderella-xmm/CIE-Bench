    "Question": "Q1: Are the lily flowers now composed of transparent, amber-tinted crystal-like material with visible jagged facets?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers have a shiny, translucent quality that suggests they are made from a crystal-like material. Their amber color and the way light reflects off their angular edges give the appearance of jagged facets, which is characteristic of crystalline materials rather than organic flowers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the petals retain their original lily shape but appear constructed from layered, sharp-edged crystal facets?",
    "explanation": "The petals in Image B maintain the general form of lily petals, which are elongated and slightly curved. However, they are depicted with multiple layers and sharp, angular edges indicating they are constructed from crystal-like elements rather than the smooth organic surfaces seen typically in real lilies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the green stems and leaves been completely replaced with delicate, transparent glass rods extending from the vase?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stems are shown as transparent rods with no color, resembling glass. These rods lack the organic texture and green color of stems and leaves, instead appearing smooth and delicate, consistent with characteristics of glass.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the bouquet placed on a smooth, dark black surface with visible marble veining, indicating a black marble tabletop?",
    "explanation": "The base in Image B is a dark, smooth surface that has white veining typically associated with marble. This suggests that the bouquet is sitting on a black marble tabletop, a material known for its elegant finish.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the entire composition—crystal flowers, glass stems, and black marble base—create a cohesive, elegant, and crafted aesthetic consistent with fine art objects?",
    "explanation": "The elements in Image B such as the crystal-like flowers, glass stems, and the marble surface come together to create a visually coherent and sophisticated aesthetic. These elements are often found in fine art and designer objects, emphasizing craftsmanship, elegance, and luxury.",
    "answer": "Yes"
