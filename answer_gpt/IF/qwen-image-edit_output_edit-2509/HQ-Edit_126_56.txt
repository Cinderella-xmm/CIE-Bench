    "Question": "Q1: Are the mountains rendered as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces instead of realistic contours?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces, resembling abstract forms rather than realistic, contoured landscapes. The visual cues suggest a stylized, artistic representation, as seen in graphic design or illustration, where geometry often plays a pivotal role.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the trees depicted as geometric forms, such as triangular or stepped shapes, with no realistic leaf details?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the trees as geometric forms, primarily triangles, without any realistic leaf details. This abstraction is typical of stylized or simplified artistic renderings where individual features like leaves are omitted in favor of sharp, simplified shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the river composed of a series of radiating parallel lines rather than a continuous, reflective body of water?",
    "explanation": "The river in Image B is clearly illustrated using radiating parallel lines, which creates a stylized and abstract depiction rather than a continuous, reflective body of water. This geometric approach is intended to evoke a design-centric interpretation rather than a naturalistic one.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q4: Are all elements in the image outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors?",
    "explanation": "Image B makes use of bold, clear lines to outline elements such as mountains, trees, and the river. These elements are filled with solid, unshaded colors, emphasizing a flat and graphic style typical of certain illustration techniques and Art Deco influences.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the reflection in the water a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements?",
    "explanation": "The reflection in Image B is depicted as a geometrically aligned mirror image using straight, symmetrical lines, reinforcing the abstract and stylized nature of the composition. This matches the geometric symmetry seen across other elements in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there any visible gradients or soft shading in the sky, mountains, or water, or are all areas filled with flat, solid colors?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it becomes evident that all areas, including the sky, mountains, and water, are filled with flat, solid colors. There are no visible gradients or soft shading, reinforcing the graphic and simplified style of the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the image use a vibrant, high-contrast color palette typical of Art Deco design, including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black?",
    "explanation": "The color palette of Image B is indeed vibrant and high-contrast, featuring bold hues such as red, gold, blue, and black. These characteristics are typical of Art Deco design, which frequently uses striking contrasts and vivid colors to achieve a dramatic visual effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
