      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the baseball player depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A 3D chibi style usually involves exaggerated and cute features, such as oversized heads and smaller bodies, often with simplified facial features. In Image B, the player has standard proportions and realistic detailing, suggesting that he is not depicted in a 3D chibi style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the baseball player appear to be reaching out toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the posture of the player in Image B, he is holding the bat in front of him in a bunting position typical in baseball rather than reaching out to the viewer. Based on the hand position, he maintains a standard batting stance rather than a reaching gesture toward the viewer.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the portal an oval-shaped frame radiating energetic blue and purple hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a glowing oval frame that surrounds the baseball player, emitting vibrant blue and purple hues, which gives the impression of an energetic portal. The oval shape and radiating colors are visually apparent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the portal act as a divider between a realistic baseball field and a whimsical chibi-themed setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portal overlays the realistic baseball field, but the setting within the portal itself doesn't show a whimsical chibi-themed setting. The player's realistic depiction does not change inside the portal, thus it does not act as a divider between a realistic and chibi-themed environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image have a 2:3 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to be close to a square shape rather than a rectangular 2:3 aspect ratio. Analyzing the image dimensions, it seems more balanced in width and height than what is typical for 2:3 aspect ratio which would be more rectangular.",
