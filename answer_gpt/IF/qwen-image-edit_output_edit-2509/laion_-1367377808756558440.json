      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the naval scene is contained within a glass cloche or bell jar, which is often associated with vintage or classic display methods.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures on the dock in Image B appear to be stylized representations akin to automatons, and their attire, upon close inspection, suggests a Victorian influence, consistent with a steampunk theme.
