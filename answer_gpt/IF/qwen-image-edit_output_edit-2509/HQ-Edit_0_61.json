      "question": "Is the entire scene reimagined as a conceptual tea brand packaging design, where the original tea setup serves as part of the product presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a packaging design for 'Zen Autumn Tea'. The original tea setup from Image A is not directly visible here, as the focus is on the packaging of the tea. Image B includes a box with tea illustrations and branding elements, which aligns with a conceptual tea brand packaging design.",

      "question": "Is the central table redesigned to resemble a tea box lid with visible engraved leaf patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the central table appears as a traditional Japanese tea table, while in Image B, the box lid features engraved leaf patterns. This represents a distinct design that echoes a tea-themed concept, but the table from Image A is not directly redesigned into a box lid in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the original tea cups replaced with illustrated representations of sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled paper, or plant-based plastics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes illustrations of tea cups on the packaging that suggest natural themes, but does not explicitly indicate they are made from sustainable materials like bamboo or plant-based plastics. The illustration style does not clearly denote the material origin. Without explicit indicators, the assumption cannot be made.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a visible tag with the text 'Zen Autumn Tea' on the packaging. However, the typography style is straightforward and does not have the characteristics of traditional calligraphy; it is more modern and simple.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is placed within a leaf-shaped silhouette, and it appears to be rendered with a texture that suggests earthy or organic qualities like grain or soil tones. It fits the description as part of the visual design.",
