      "question": "Are the cheetah figures replaced with gold-finished perfume bottles that maintain their original seated poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects previously identified as cheetah figures are now depicted as two objects with a gold finish. They have a similar form and seated pose to the original cheetah figures from Image A, indicating they are likely intended as perfume bottles designed to mimic this pose for elegance. The decision for them to maintain a seated pose aligns with the common visual representation of such items intended to convey sophistication and thematic consistency.",

      "question": "Has the botanical center been replaced with a translucent, green-tinted glass façade that has a cascading downward appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a central object that has a translucent green appearance and vertical lines that suggest a downward cascading effect, giving the impression of a glass façade. In contrast to Image A's botanical-themed center, Image B's design likely draws inspiration from typical glass display techniques used in luxury items.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bases in Image B clearly display text reading 'Savanna Essence' in a polished serif font. Serif fonts are often associated with elegance and tradition, making them suitable for luxury branding, aligning with the aesthetic of Image B.

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image convey an elegant and luxurious aesthetic consistent with a high-end retail perfume display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features elements such as gold-finished bottles, a green-tinted glass façade, and formal serif text, which are commonly associated with luxury design. These combined aspects create a visually sophisticated arrangement, akin to those found in high-end perfume displays, with the gold finish of the bottles and the polished font contributing to the elevated aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two gold-finished perfume bottles symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade, preserving the original spatial arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The symmetry of object placement in Image B mirrors the arrangement seen in Image A. Each gold-finished bottle is positioned on either side of the central green-tinted glass façade; this mimics the original spatial layout of the cheetah figures flanking the botanical center but with elements representing a new elegant and sophisticated design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a reflective surface below the objects, as evidenced by how the bottom edges of the perfume bottles and the central green façade project mirror-like reflections. Such a technique is akin to high-end displays aiming to enhance visual depth and attractiveness, signifying a typical upscale presentation.",
