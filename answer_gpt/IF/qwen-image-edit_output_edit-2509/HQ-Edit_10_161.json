      "question": "Has the dress been transformed into a mosaic-style design using geometric shapes that resemble African tribal art, while retaining the original pattern layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress retains the original pattern layout but has been transformed using mosaic-style designs. The geometric shapes incorporated in the mosaic resemble traditional African tribal art, often characterized by distinct colors and patterned shapes. The analysis takes into account the vibrant mosaic appearance, contrasting from Image A’s fabric texture. This suggests a deliberate design transformation into a mosaic-style art form.",

      "question": "Have the beaded necklace and bracelets been replaced with stained glass tile designs featuring vibrant colors and lead-line-like borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the necklace and bracelets replaced with stained glass tile designs, which are characterized by vibrant colors and lead-line-like borders. These elements have a pattern similar to stained glass art, giving them a unique and vivid appearance compared to the bead texture seen in Image A. This transformation aligns with the art style seen in mosaics, emphasizing the visual change.",

      "question": "Has the background been transformed into a stylized tapestry of warm earth tones, depicting varied African terrains through texture and color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has indeed transformed into a stylized tapestry using warm earth tones, creating a textured depiction of African terrains. The tonal blending and texture suggest a deliberate artistic choice to create a tapestry effect, focusing on the visual richness typical of African landscapes. This contrasts with Image A’s natural outdoor setting, highlighting the artistic transformation.",

      "question": "Has the hairstyle been transformed into a bas-relief sculpture style, with visible depth, shadow, and sculpted texture, while preserving its original color and structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle maintains its original structure and color, but unlike the bas-relief sculpture style described, it predominantly retains the bead and braid design seen in informal settings. There is no indication of overt sculpting or visibly enhanced depth and shadow. It retains a natural appearance much like Image A, focusing on cultural hairstyle characteristics instead of sculpture-like transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has transformed many elements, such as attire and jewelry, into vibrant mosaic and stained glass styles, while maintaining the cultural essence of African art through geometric shapes and patterns. The background complements this theme, with stylized African landscapes creating a cohesive art style. Although the hairstyle did not change dramatically, the overall image retains cultural authenticity and visual harmony, reflecting a consistent thematic transformation.",
