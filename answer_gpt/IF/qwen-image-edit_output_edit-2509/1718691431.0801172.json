      "question": "Are the kimono and fox mask rendered with sharp geometric shapes and angular lines characteristic of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox mask features angular ears and geometrically stylized patterns on the mask itself. The kimono also incorporates sharp line designs, particularly evident in the background, which includes Art Deco-styled geometric borders. These visual elements are consistent with the sharp geometric shapes and angular lines of Art Deco design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays bold lines outlining the ears of the mask. The kimono, although rich in pattern, maintains structured and clear lines that intersect with angular geometry. These visual characteristics confirm the presence of bold lines and angular geometry.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the floral patterns are still present, they appear stylized with minimalist interpretations, representing more abstract motifs compared to potentially realistic depictions. This suggests a transformation into simplified and stylized designs.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
