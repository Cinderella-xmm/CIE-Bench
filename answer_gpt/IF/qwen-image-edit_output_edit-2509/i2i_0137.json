      "question": "Is the black vase replaced with a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object placed on the table is a white teapot. This can be identified by its typical shape, including the handle and spout, which are distinct from the black vase seen in Image A. By visual examination, we can confirm that the black vase is no longer present.",

      "question": "Are there two porcelain cups placed on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there are two small white objects beside the teapot on the table. Their shape and size are consistent with common porcelain cups, suggesting their function in a tea or coffee context alongside the teapot.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B includes two chairs facing each other with a teapot and two cups on the table between them. This arrangement, often seen in social contexts, suggests a setting prepared for two people to have a conversation over tea or coffee.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the room layout, including the position of the chairs, table, rug, plants, and curtains, appears to remain consistent with no noticeable changes in background or furniture placement from Image A to Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot and porcelain cups are well-lit, with shadows and highlights consistent with the lighting from the window. This suggests they have been integrated naturally into the scene without disrupting the existing environmental conditions.",
