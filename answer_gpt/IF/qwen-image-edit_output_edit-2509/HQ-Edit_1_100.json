      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a visible calendar layout element (such as a date, month, or decorative border) indicating the image is formatted as an art calendar page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of dates and abbreviations for days of the week along the bottom edge, along with a clear border around the image, indicates that the composition is structured in the style of a calendar page. These elements are typical in calendar designs to convey information for days, weeks, and months.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure exhibit characteristics of a half-cartoon style, such as stylized facial features, smooth lines, or exaggerated proportions while maintaining realism in other areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays visual characteristics associated with a half-cartoon style. The smooth lines, simple shapes, and distinct lack of realistic texture in the figure's dress and hairstyle suggest a stylized approach. While proportions remain realistic, the abstraction simplifies features, consistent with cartoon styling.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book in Image B extends across the table, but compared to conventional proportions, it maintains a typical page size and does not appear overly elongated. Its proportions match what one would expect in books of this type depicted in stylized art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts sleeves that suggest soft drapery with gentle curvature and folds. The flowing lines imply a textured fabric, similar to the realism shown in classic illustrations of clothing with such features.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons on the garment in the illustration are plain, with no indication of golden filigree or elaborate patterns present. They lack delicate engravings or ornate designs, focusing instead on simplicity.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the library shelves in Image B surrounds the central figure with a distinctly stylized framing, emphasizing a wooden backdrop that frames the scene similarly to classical portrait renderings. This contributes to the aesthetic framing of the composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are visual elements such as warm lighting, aged books, wooden surfaces, and focused reading posture present to enhance the scholarly atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "explanation": "In Image B, elements such as wooden shelves packed with books, a focused reading posture, and an overall stylized ambiance contribute to a scholarly atmosphere. However, warm lighting is less apparent compared to Image A, which utilizes shadow and light to enhance coziness more explicitly.",
