      "question": "Does the edited image feature a halftone pattern with dots creating shades and gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays a noticeable halftone pattern, which is characterized by the use of small dots that vary in size or spacing to create a gradient effect. This technique gives the image a textured look and is commonly seen in comic book art. The presence of these dots can clearly be seen within the image, contributing to the shading and tonal variations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses vibrant colors with strong, noticeable contrasts. The bright blue background contrasts sharply against the yellow and black of the soccer ball, as well as the white and black of the goalpost. This use of contrasting colors makes the elements stand out against each other and enhances their visibility and impact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soccer ball and goalpost in Image B are depicted with clean, precise lines that give them sharp, well-defined edges. This aligns with the graphic style of cartoon or comic images, which often employ strong outlines to separate elements and increase clarity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball and goalpost are represented in a simplified, cartoonish manner. While the details are minimal, the forms are bold and easily distinguishable due to the strong outlines and colors used. This simplification retains their recognizable shapes, typical of graphic or illustrative styles.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual effect of Image B is indeed striking due to its use of bright colors, halftone patterns, and dynamic contrasts. The composition is visually engaging, with the soccer ball prominently positioned in front of the goalpost and enhanced by the graphic style, which collectively creates a dynamic and vibrant appearance.",
