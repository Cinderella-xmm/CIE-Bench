      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains three distinct sections, each featuring a different representation of the woman.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "One of the postcards in Image B features the woman standing next to a structure with a straw roof, indicative of a hut, with her leaning posture against the wall.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In one of the postcards in Image B, the artwork features bold colors and stylized lines, particularly in the depiction of the woman's jewelry, which appears abstract and non-realistic. This stylistic choice is characterized by exaggerated colors and patterns that deviate from a realistic representation, typical of many art styles.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rightmost postcard clearly presents the woman as a silhouette with minimal detail, placed against a digitally crafted landscape with grass and distant hills. The silhouette contrasts with the bright background, emphasizing a digitally rendered environment.",

These elements contribute to the cohesiveness and artistic appeal of the postcards.",
