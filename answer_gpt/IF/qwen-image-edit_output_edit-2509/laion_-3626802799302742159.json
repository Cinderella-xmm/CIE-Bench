      "question": "Are expressive faces and limbs added to the cookies to make them anthropomorphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies are depicted with expressive faces and limbs, making them appear anthropomorphic. The cookies are sitting in chairs with arms and legs, indicating the addition of features to make them look like characters. This is not a typical characteristic of cookies, which are generally inanimate and without personality traits. These anthropomorphic features are added to enhance engagement and humor, which is commonly used in illustrations or animations to give personality to food items.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include at least one cookie with a grinning expression, one with a pouting expression, and one with a winking expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is one cookie with a grinning expression, which is the cup with a large smile and eyes. Another cookie has a winking expression, which is shown sitting on a chair to the right, and it has been drawn with an eye closed. The cookie with the blurred face appears to be representing another emotion, but the specific details are obscured, and there isn't a visible pouting expression. Therefore, despite the presence of the winking and grinning expressions, the pouting expression is absent or indiscernible.",

      "question": "Is there a tea party scene depicted, including props such as a tiny tea table or teacups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a tea party scene. A small tea table is placed in front of the cookies with a small teacup on top, suggesting a setting where the cookies are gathered as if participating in a tea party. The arrangement of these elements typically forms part of a playful visual narrative used in settings where food items are anthropomorphized.",

      "question": "Has the cup been modified to resemble a clubhouse, such as having windows, doors, or other architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the cup has been modified to have a face, with eyes and a mouth adding personality to it, it has not been altered to include architectural details like windows or doors that are characteristic of a clubhouse. The modifications are more focused on anthropomorphism rather than replicating architectural features.",

      "question": "Has the pink plate been replaced with a floral-patterned picnic blanket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the previous pink plate is no longer present, and the cookies and the cup are instead placed on a surface with a floral-patterned fabric, which appears to be used as a blanket, suggesting a picnic-like setting. This replacement is indicative of creating a themed and cozy scene typical of a picnic, enhancing the storytelling aspect of the image.",
