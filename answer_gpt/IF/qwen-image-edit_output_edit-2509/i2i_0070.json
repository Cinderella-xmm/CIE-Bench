      "question": "Is the background showing an African savanna scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene includes characteristic features such as vast open grasslands and scattered acacia trees, which align with typical views of an African savanna landscape. The acacia trees are a strong visual cue prompting this recognition, as they are commonly found in African savannas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the image set against a dark, night-time sky indicative of nighttime?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a dark sky filled with stars and the Milky Way, indicating nighttime conditions. The absence of sunlight and the presence of a starry sky suggest it is late evening or nighttime.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Milky Way clearly visible in the sky above the savanna?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the Milky Way spanning across the sky, forming a vivid cluster of stars and dust clouds stretched diagonally. This visibility is usually associated with photos taken in remote areas with minimal light pollution, often reflecting the grandeur of the Milky Way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are multiple stars visible alongside the Milky Way in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, apart from the Milky Way, individual stars are scattered across the sky. These stars punctuate the dark sky, further validating the nighttime setting, typical of a clear and expansive sky often seen in open settings like a savanna.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the train and railway tracks appear seamlessly integrated into the savanna background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "The integration of the train and railway tracks in Image B onto the savanna background lacks seamlessness. The edited image positions the train and tracks between typical savanna features, like the acacia trees, but thereâ€™s a discrepancy in lighting and shadow effects (the train lacks shadows corresponding to surrounding objects like the tree). This indicates that the elements may have been digitally combined rather than naturally integrated.",
