      "question": "Are the surfaces of the castle composed of visible wooden puzzle pieces with natural oak and mahogany coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features surfaces with distinct colors of natural wood shadesâ€”specifically oak and mahogany. These colors are indicative of wooden materials, and the segmented appearance of the castle's surfaces suggests they are puzzle-like, composed of interlocking pieces. This conclusion is drawn from my understanding of typical wooden textures and visual cues provided by the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the castle retain its original architectural structure, including two towers, arched entrance, multiple windows, and connecting walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited castle in Image B maintains the same overall structure as the castle in Image A, with two towers, an arched entrance, multiple windows, and connecting walls, despite the change in materials. This conclusion is drawn from a comparison of the architectural outline in both images, where the foundational design remains consistent between the original and edited versions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tops of both towers display detailed interlocking puzzle piece patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the tops of both towers exhibit characteristics representative of puzzle pieces, showing interlocking patterns common in wooden puzzles. This suggests careful manipulation of the surfaces to achieve this design, guided by the segmented appearance typical of jigsaw or building puzzles.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the castle placed on a smooth, flat wooden tabletop that serves as the new base of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base on which the castle is located appears to be a smooth, flat surface, typical of a wooden tabletop. This conclusion is derived from recognizing the uniform texture and smoothness characteristic of tabletops, lacking any natural features seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the wooden components of the castle visibly segmented into individual puzzle-like pieces with defined edges and joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parts of Image B's castle are visibly divided into sections that resemble puzzle pieces or blocks. The defined edges and joints indicate they are separate segments fitted together, causing the appearance of a constructed puzzle model. This segmentation is typical in wooden block models or puzzles.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reflective water in front of the castle absent or replaced by the wooden tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the absence of the reflective water found in Image A. Instead, the castle is situated on a wooden tabletop. This assessment is based on identifying the flat, non-reflective wooden surface that has replaced the original water element present in the initial image.",
