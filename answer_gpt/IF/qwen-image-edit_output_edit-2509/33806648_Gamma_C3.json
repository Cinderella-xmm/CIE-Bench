      "question": "Does the edited image depict the rock arch as a recognizable stone guardian creature with anthropomorphic or guardian-like features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the rock arch, there is a distinct depiction of a creature that appears humanoid, holding a glowing orb. This image suggests an anthropomorphic or guardian-like feature as the creature stands prominently in the archway, suggesting a presence of protection or mystique, commonly associated with guardian-like figures. This is not just a transformation of the rock, but the addition of an entirely new character.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible crystalline structures growing along the curved edges of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Image B, there are numerous blue crystal-like formations attached along the curved edges of the rock arch. These formations significantly alter the arch's natural edges by introducing reflective and vibrant structures that are characteristic of crystalline growth.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there luminous, vein-like lines running across the surface of the arch that follow naturalistic branching patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, alongside the crystalline structures, there are vein-like luminous lines that emanate from the edge of the arch. These lines resemble natural branching patterns, similar to veins or root systems, and give a bioluminescent glow. This detail adds a mystical and enchanted quality to the arch.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original arch outline been replaced with skeletal, wing-like protrusions extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the structure of the arch itself remains largely visible, without being completely replaced by any protrusions. Instead of skeletal or wing-like features taking over the entire outline, there are crystalline extensions, but they do not form a skeletal, wing-like pattern. The original arch is still discernible without any complete replacement.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there clearly visible runic symbols engraved or etched onto the inner surface of the arch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inner surface of the arch is covered with what appears to be runic symbols. These symbols are visibly etched or superimposed on the stone surface, adding elements of mysticism and ancient script to the image, which are typically associated with magical or historical storytelling motifs.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a glowing orb positioned centrally within the arch, acting as a source of radiance and energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the center of the arch guardian-like figure in Image B, there is clearly a glowing orb. This orb appears to be the focal point of the light and energy in the scene, casting a bright illumination that differentiates its presence from the surrounding rocky textures.",
