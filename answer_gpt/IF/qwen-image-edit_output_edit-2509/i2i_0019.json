      "question": "Does the elephant appear as a 3D chibi-style desktop figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a small, cartoonish elephant inside a dome, characterized by simplified and exaggerated features typical of chibi style, such as an oversized head and smaller body. This indicates it is presented as a 3D figurine rather than a real elephant.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the elephant holding a piece of green grass, which resembles the action of eating. In the original image, the elephant is eating grass. The action of holding grass suggests it maintains a similar pose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in the edited image appears to be brown and has uneven textures with small green patches, resembling muddy terrain. The words 'Jungle Friend' are clearly engraved around the circular edge, indicating it is intentionally designed to mimic such terrain.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the materials used matte polymer clay for the figurine and a transparent acrylic dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues from the edited image suggest a smooth, non-shiny texture for the elephant and base, typical of matte polymer clay materials used in such models. The dome appears clear and shiny, consistent with the appearance of a transparent acrylic dome used in product displays.",
