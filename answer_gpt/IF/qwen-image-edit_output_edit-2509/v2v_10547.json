    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a squirrel present in the foreground of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a clear and distinct image of a squirrel is visible in the foreground of the painting. This is based on the visual cues of the small mammal's characteristics such as the bushy tail, small nose, and pointed ears, which are features associated with a squirrel.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel blend naturally with the painting's brushstrokes and color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel in Image B appears to have a more realistic and detailed style compared to the painting's impressionistic brushstrokes and color blending. The painting's original style, as evidenced in Image A, uses swirling strokes and a more abstract color technique that is not mirrored in the more defined depiction of the squirrel.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the squirrel positioned in the foreground, closer to the viewer than other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is positioned prominently in the foreground, distinctly separated from the background elements such as the village and the cypress trees, making it appear closer to the viewer than other elements in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the addition of the squirrel maintain the overall harmony and composition of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the squirrel is well-positioned in the foreground, its realistic appearance and differing style do not entirely harmonize with the abstract and flowing composition of the rest of the painting, which disrupts the overall visual harmony.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the squirrel sized appropriately in relation to other elements in the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the typical relative sizes and proportions in paintings, the squirrel appears substantially larger compared to the background elements such as the trees and the buildings in the village, which suggests it is not sized proportionately to match other elements within the scene.",
