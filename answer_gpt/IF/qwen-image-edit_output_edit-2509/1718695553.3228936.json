      "question": "Is the background of the image now a flat white studio background instead of a sandy beach?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed a flat white studio background, which indicates that the setting has shifted to a more controlled environment as opposed to Image A which has a sandy beach backdrop. This conclusion is drawn from the stark contrast of the background and lack of outdoor elements in Image B.",
