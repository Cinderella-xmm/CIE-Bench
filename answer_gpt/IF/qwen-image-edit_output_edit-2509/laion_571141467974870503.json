      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall scene rendered in a pop art style with bright, flat colors and comic book-like aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly altered from a photographic depiction to a bright and vibrant pop art style. Pop art is characterized by its use of bold, bright, and often flat colors, as well as a stylistic resemblance to comic book aesthetics, which include elements such as halftone dots. The transformation of the natural landscape, building, and train into flat color blocks and dotted patterns is typical of pop art, indicating a shift from realistic depiction to an interpretative artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train feature bold primary colors (such as red, blue, or yellow) and halftone dot patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is composed of various sections filled with bold primary colors like bright green, blue, and pink, along with halftone dot patterns, typical of pop art and comic book styles. These colors do not accurately represent the traditional realistic colors of a train, which are impacted to present an artistic style associated with pop art.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the barnâ€™s wooden texture been replaced with stylized geometric shapes instead of realistic wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn's surface displays a clear deviation from the traditional wooden texture seen in Image A. Instead, it shows a composition of solid, vivid colors that simplify the structure into geometric shapes compartmentalized by lines. This alteration is characteristic of transforming a realistic image into a more stylized, abstract, or pop art representation, losing the intricate wood grain detailing of traditional wooden boards.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the trees and grass been converted into vibrant, abstract, graphic bursts rather than realistic vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage, including trees and grass, is transformed into vibrant, abstract patches of color. This diverges from naturalistic textures and colors seen in reality, as depicted in Image A. The abstraction involves using bright and unnatural color schemes that highlight an artistic representation over replicating real-life vegetation, characteristic of pop art's preference for abstract visual dynamics over realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image (train, barn, tracks, foliage) outlined with sharp, black lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the major elements such as the train, barn, tracks, and foliage are distinctly delineated using sharp, black lines. This outlines each element prominently, a technique often employed in comic art and pop art styles to separate different areas and increase visual impact. Such black lining is absent in natural photographs, such as Image A, because these use soft transitions and blending instead.",
