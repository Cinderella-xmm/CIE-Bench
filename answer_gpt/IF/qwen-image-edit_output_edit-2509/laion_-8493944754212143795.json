      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon is depicted with a mane composed of flowing, translucent structures reminiscent of water.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the rocks physically transforming into the scale-armored body of the dragon. Instead, the dragon's design is superimposed onto the rocks in the environment. While it is embedded within the scene, the rocks themselves maintain their natural form, providing a contextual background rather than becoming part of the dragon's body.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white foam from the waterfall is creatively arranged to resemble misty, cloud-like wings, seamlessly integrated into the dragon’s design. The dragon features two large wings extending from its body, prominently formed by the white foam depicted in the scene.",
