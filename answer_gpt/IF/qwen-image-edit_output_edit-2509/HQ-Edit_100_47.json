      "question": "Is the image presented as a three-dimensional shadow box diorama with visible depth created by layered components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues include a rectangular enclosure with depth, housing various landscape components such as the Eiffel Tower, trees, and buildings. The presentation in a box-like format with a frame and visible layers suggests a three-dimensional shadow box diorama. The layering of elements indicates a deliberate attempt to create depth through dimensional separation. These observations lead to the conclusion that Image B is indeed a shadow box diorama.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the skyline and foreground elements visibly separated into multiple layered paper cut-out sections to simulate depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows distinct sections where layers appear separated to create depth, such as the skyline, the Eiffel Tower, and the foreground. The separation and arrangement resemble layered paper cut-outs. The separation and arrangement of components suggest a purposeful design to simulate depth in a three-dimensional form. Therefore, Image B achieves depth through these layered sections.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the grassy lawn area been replaced with a reflective, mirror-like surface that shows reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy areas retain their original appearance with green surfaces and no visible reflective qualities indicative of a mirror-like surface. The lawns are consistent with regular grass lawns rather than being replaced with a mirror-like surface. Observed reflections or mirror characteristics are absent in the grassy sections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there numerous small, detailed, three-dimensional-looking pedestrian figures scattered throughout the scene, particularly on pathways and near the base of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, looking closely at pathways and areas near the Eiffel Tower, tiny figures with a slight three-dimensional appearance are present, resembling pedestrians. The detailed and meticulous representation of people indicates a three-dimensional interpretation. This observation suggests that numerous small pedestrian figures are scattered throughout the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene framed by a dark border with visible metallic edges, consistent with a shadow box enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a rectangular frame surrounding the main scene, characterized by dark borders and visible metallic edges, which are typical features of a shadow box enclosure and add structural depth to the image presentation. This confirms that the scene is presented within such a border.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are city names and geographic coordinates visibly engraved along the outer edge of the frame in fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B's frame, although there are engraved labels, they do not clearly show city names or geographic coordinates as typically expected and detailed enough to be considered geographic identifiers. The engravings seem more decorative than informative with regard to location details.",
