    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central feature of the spiral staircase is transformed to resemble a large, serpent-like creature with distinct scales, indicating that the design deviates significantly from a standard architectural staircase. This design choice is visually prominent in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure instead of conventional steps appears to be composed of tightly interlocking scales, suggesting a pattern analogous to reptilian or snake skin.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railing remains largely unaltered in terms of its appearance compared to a standard railing, maintaining a wooden finish without distinctly mimicking a spine or vertebrae.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display wooden patterns resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body, focusing instead on a snake-like, scaled texture for the main structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent structure along the central staircase exhibits a smooth, scale-like appearance without any indication of stone-like ridges or rough, rocky textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B shows the staircase forming continuous coils that are visually consistent with the body of a serpent, enhancing the fluidity and gracefulness characteristic of such a creatureâ€™s movements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent creature exhibit visual traits suggesting antiquity and natural grandeur (such as weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does contain visual attributes of natural grandeur and organic form with the texture of scales; however, it does not prominently feature weathered textures or distinctly earthy colors that are typically associated with antiquity.",
