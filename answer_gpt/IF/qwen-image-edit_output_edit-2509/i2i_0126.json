        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists of multiple illustrations that represent different perspectives of the same office environment. One of these illustrations clearly shows the front view, as we can see the setup directly facing the viewer, with the desk, chairs, and computers arranged as they would appear when looking head-on into the room. This perspective includes recognizable features of a front view, such as desk placement and wall decorations visible from this angle.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an illustration where the office is viewed from the side, which is evident from the placement of the desk and chairs from a lateral angle, showcasing how the person seated at the desk would appear from this particular viewpoint. Side views are often used to depict another dimension of an environment, capturing the spatial arrangement along the length of the desk and lateral view of the individuals within.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, one of the illustrations presents a top-view perspective, which is identified by the depiction of the room as seen from above. The arrangement includes visualizing two people seated at a desk with the office furniture situated around them, offering an aerial view of the spatial layout and overall positioning within the office setting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly separates the three perspectives—front, side, and top—into separate sections within a single composition, effectively illustrating the office scene from multiple angles. This tripartite structure allows viewers to understand the office environment comprehensively from each viewpoint.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, when the three distinct views are combined, they provide a thorough representation of the office environment. Each illustration incorporates important elements like desks, chairs, computers, and plants, offering a comprehensive understanding of the spatial layout and how these components interact within the room.",
