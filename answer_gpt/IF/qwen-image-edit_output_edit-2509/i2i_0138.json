      "question": "Has the word \"Sharp\" been added at the top left of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Sharp' is prominent at the top left of the image. By analyzing this area, the scene shows the distinct presence of a word that is not likely inherent to the visual of scissors, suggesting it has been added as a descriptor or stylistic element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the word \"Clean\" been added at the bottom right of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Clean' is clearly visible at the bottom right. By examining the visual layout, this element appears prominent in the area typically associated with additional text additions rather than part of any background object, indicating it has been intentionally placed there.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the words \"Sharp\" and \"Clean\" styled as a rough sketch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the font and artistic style of the words 'Sharp' and 'Clean' in Image B, they appear to have a hand-drawn, sketch-like quality. This rough sketch style is recognized by the irregular edges and pencil-like texture that align with the classic elements of sketching.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a professional and relevant look for a hairdressing tools brand ad?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has added the words 'Sharp' and 'Clean' with a stylized sketch design that could convey creativity. While it adds an artistic flair, the sketch style with handwritten text might not align with the sleek professionalism typically expected in advertising high-end hairdressing tools, which often favor a more polished and sleek appearance. Thus, it may not entirely fit the criterion of looking professional in that specific industry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any elements added or altered in the image other than placing \"Sharp\" and \"Clean\" as specified in the instructions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No\n```",
      "explanation": "Apart from the words 'Sharp' and 'Clean,' examining Image B compared to Image A, it presents in a similar manner with no other obvious additions or alterations. Although there is a stylization effect, it corresponds with the text addition rather than additional objects or significant modifications.",
