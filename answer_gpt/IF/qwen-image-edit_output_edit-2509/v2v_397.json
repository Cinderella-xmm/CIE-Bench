      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show five dolls designed after the style of Russian nesting dolls, known as Matryoshka dolls. These dolls are characterized by their ability to nest within each other and often feature colorful and elaborate designs. Given the context of visual transformation from an individual with a camera setup in Image A, the collection of dolls in Image B suggests a creative reinterpretation of the original figure into nesting dolls.",
