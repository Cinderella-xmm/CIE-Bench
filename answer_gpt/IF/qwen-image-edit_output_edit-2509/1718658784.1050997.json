    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cake feature bold, graphic icing patterns such as geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs instead of realistic frosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake displays bold, colorful shapes and patterns with clear outlines, resembling geometric designs and abstract forms. These patterns are characterized by their stylized and repetitive nature, typical of graphic art styles, as opposed to a realistic depiction with nuanced textures seen in traditional cakes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloons composed of vivid monochrome dots rather than solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows balloons filled with monochrome dots instead of the smooth solid colors usually seen in balloons or as depicted in Image A. This patterning is a common technique in pop art, which utilizes dots for shading and color infill.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the table rendered as a flat, solid color block without texture or gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table lacks any visible texture, gradients, or depth, being a simple solid color block in the foreground. This minimalist approach is typical of pop art, focusing on flatness and solid hues rather than realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase depicted as a solid color block without visible texture or design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals the vase as having bold, solid colors and stylized shapes without the nuanced texture or intricate design observed in Image A. This simplification aligns with pop art's tendency for flat representation and abstraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the candle flame have exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flame is depicted using sharp, angular lines and vibrant colors rather than the soft, flickering look of a real flame. This stylization is common in pop art, which uses exaggerated forms and bright hues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit characteristics of pop art, including flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exemplifies pop art characteristics with flat, bold colors, strong outlines, and stylized representation across the entire scene. Each element, from balloons to the cake, adheres to the graphic and vibrant aesthetic typical of pop art, distinct from the realistic and textured approach seen in Image A.",
