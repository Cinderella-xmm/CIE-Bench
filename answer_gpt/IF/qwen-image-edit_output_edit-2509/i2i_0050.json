      "question": "Does the edited image contain three separate frames capturing the skater's motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are clearly three distinct frames arranged side by side, each showing a different part of the skater's motion. This layout suggests the intention to depict a sequence of actions involved in the skater's motion, with each frame showing a successive part of a single move. The fact that the skater is captured in separate positions further supports this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three frames clearly showing the push-off, ground contact, and forward lean of the skater?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, each frame captures a different phase of the skater's action. The first frame shows the setup or push-off stage, the second one depicts the skater in motion where ground contact is illustrated, and the third frame shows the skater leaning forward. This sequential presentation captures distinct parts of the skater's motion in a coherent manner.",

      "question": "Does the edited image retain the real image style without any significant stylistic distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains a realistic style consistent with common photographic depictions of motion sequences. Although motion trajectory lines are added for emphasis, the overall integrity and clarity of the real elements within each frame are preserved, indicating no significant stylistic distortions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are motion trajectory lines present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing the edited image, motion trajectory lines are visible around the skater in each frame. These lines are added to visually emphasize the motion path and the dynamics involved in the skater's movement, enhancing the depiction of motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three frames combined in a cohesive manner within the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of the edited image suggests a seamless transition from one frame to the next, portraying continuity in the action. The use of motion trajectory lines unifies the sequence and helps guide the viewer's eye through the stages of the skater's movement, ensuring a cohesive representation.",
