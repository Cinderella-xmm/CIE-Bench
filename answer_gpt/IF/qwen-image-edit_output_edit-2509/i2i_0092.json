        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phone and stand are clearly visible in the foreground, placed on the tabletop. This indicates that they have not been removed from the image. Observing the phone and stand, one can recognize familiar shapes and design elements that are common for mobile phones and stands, confirming their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden tabletop with the ocean in the background, accompanied by several café tables and chairs. The reflections on the sea and the composition of the objects suggest the setting is a seaside café. With common knowledge of how outdoor café settings often look, alongside the visual cues from the image like the view of the ocean, it appears that the scene has indeed been altered to depict a seaside café setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicts sunny weather with the ocean in the background, giving way to sunlight that reflects on the water, which is a common occurrence in seaside scenarios. These reflections aren't seen directly on the tabletop; however, the scene and lighting suggest a bright and reflective atmosphere typical of sunny beachside locations, thus giving an indirect indication of their presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features elements commonly associated with a seaside café atmosphere. These include a waterfront view, the presence of a drinking glass on the table, and the visibility of tables and chairs in the background. Such elements collectively create the ambiance one would expect at a seaside café. This understanding is based on typical setups seen in real-world seaside cafés.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a realistic tabletop perspective and composition in the seaside café setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The perspective and composition in Image B are realistic for a tabletop setting. The image shows a natural arrangement of objects on a table, like a phone stand, glass, spoon, and background elements like other tables and the sea. The perspective aligns with how a photo might naturally capture such a scene, especially in a seaside café where tables are oriented towards a scenic view.",
