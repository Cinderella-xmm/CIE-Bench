      "question": "Does the image include a full-body depiction of a unique creature inspired by the ancient jungle temple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate an ancient jungle temple as the main subject of the illustration, with an ornate object (perhaps a vase or capsule) placed prominently in the foreground. This ornate object does not resemble a creature but is likely stylized to complement the temple theme. There is no depiction of a creature inspired by the jungle temple. Therefore, the answer is based purely on the absence of any creature in the image.",

      "question": "Does the creature's design incorporate retro aesthetics commonly found in Japanese RPG monster art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a depiction of a creature. Therefore, there is nothing in the image to assess regarding any design aesthetic reminiscent of Japanese RPG art.",

      "question": "Does the creature's design visibly incorporate the temple's shape, textures, and mystical ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features an ancient jungle temple and an ornate capsule object, but there is no creature present. The temple itself is more prominent, surrounded by dense jungle, and showcases textures and mystical elements. However, no creature design can be evaluated from the image.",

      "question": "Is there a custom-designed orb or capsule at the creature's feet, featuring patterns and colors that align with the temple's architectural details and natural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a custom-designed capsule with intricate patterns exists prominently in the foreground. These patterns may align with natural and architectural elements present in the temple's environment. However, since there is no creature in the image, it can't be said to be at a creature's feet.",

      "question": "Is the creature's invented name displayed beside or beneath it, along with its elemental type reflecting the temple's core characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'INVENTED NAME.' is displayed beneath the ornate object instead of a creature, along with words like 'Earth,' 'Nature,' and 'Ancient.' These might reflect the temple's characteristics, but again, there is no creature depicted in the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a temple illustration with an ornate object, using clear lines and vibrant colors typical of stylized art rather than subtle shading or an encyclopedia style. The image layout with titles and text mimics artistic posters or cards more than encyclopedia entries.",
