      "question": "Is the saxophone transformed into a serpent-like creature with a coiled body and metallic scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), a saxophone is not present. Instead, a serpent-like creature with metallic scales and a coiled body is shown. This transformation indicates that the saxophone from the original image (Image A), which is not being analyzed here, has been replaced in the context of the image with a serpent form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original saxophone keys replaced with gemstones that exhibit a shimmering, reflective quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible saxophone keys; instead, the serpent-like creature is adorned with gemstones that exhibit a reflective, shimmering quality. This suggests that any saxophone keys present in the original image have been conceptually replaced or represented by these gemstones in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the bell of the saxophone been transformed into an open maw featuring sharp, stylized fangs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a serpent with an open mouth, displaying sharp, stylized fangs. This design choice suggests an imaginative transformation from the saxophone bell to a serpent's maw, replacing the original musical instrument's component with this new creature feature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the saxophone’s neck extend into a coiled serpent body decorated with delicate filigree patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the neck of the perceived creature (representing the saxophone) extends into a coiled body, intricately decorated with patterns resembling filigree. This transformation suggests the saxophone's neck is now visually represented as part of a serpent’s body with artistic embellishments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the reed been transformed into a barbed tongue extending from the serpent’s maw?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a serpent with an open mouth, from which a barbed tongue protrudes. This element seems to replace the function or symbolism of the saxophone’s reed, filling the space with a mythical or stylized natural element instead of the musical component.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the saxophone/serpent resting on a red velvet cushion identical in appearance to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, a creature is placed on a similarly styled red velvet cushion. The continuity of the cushion's material and texture between the two images suggests that while the central object has changed, the base or platform it rests on remains visually consistent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the lighting still focused on the central subject, producing a spotlight effect similar to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the lighting effect casts a spotlight on the central subject—the serpent—similar to the way the saxophone was illuminated in the original image. This continuity in lighting technique ensures that the dramatic focus remains consistent between the two images.",
