      "question": "Does the edited image show the building transformed into a giant mechanical golem with visible articulated limbs and exposed gears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a giant mechanical golem is depicted, characterized by its articulated limbs, exposed gears, and mechanical structure. These are elements commonly associated with a mechanical golem rather than a building. Image A shows a skyscraper with angular design typical of modern architecture, without any mechanical features. Therefore, the transformation in Image B is evident.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all original windows replaced with glowing energy panels that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem features glowing surfaces that resemble energy panels, emitting light from its chest and arms. In Image A, the building has standard windows typical of a residential or office building. The visual change from windows to glowing energy panels is a clear transformation in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the balconies been transformed into arm-like mechanical appendages extending from the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, arm-like mechanical appendages are visible as part of the golem's structure. They appear to replace the original balconies of the building seen in Image A. These appendages have a mechanical design, suggesting a transformation from the static balconies originally present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate circuit patterns covering the surface of the building, resembling electronic wiring or circuits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the mechanical golem is detailed with intricate circuit patterns that resemble electronic wiring, a common motif in sci-fi representations of robots. Image A's building shows no such patterns, only the concrete and glass facade typical of modern architecture. The addition of these patterns is a clear change in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the building's angular edges appear as dynamic or movable mechanical components, such as hinges, pistons, or rotating joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angular edges of the mechanical golem suggest dynamic or movable components, as seen in the mechanical design of the arms and legs with joints and visible hinges. Image A features static architectural edges of a building, lacking any indication of movable mechanical parts. The transformation to dynamic components is evident in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background still a clear blue sky without any changes or additions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B feature a clear blue sky as the background. The background remains consistent between the two images without any significant changes or additions, maintaining the same atmospheric setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the buildingâ€™s overall size and position within the frame remained consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mechanical golem occupying the same spatial position within the frame as the original building in Image A. The size of the golem mirrors that of the building, indicating that the overall size and position have been maintained in the transformation.",
