      "question": "Has the overall shape and structure of the car been redesigned to resemble a high-performance gaming controller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car retains its original shape and structure, which is that of a sports car. There are no visual cues or modifications that alter its general form to mimic a gaming controller. Instead, the structure of the car remains very much like a traditional vehicle. A gaming controller has a more compact, handheld shape, which is not reflected in the car's design.",

      "question": "Have the gullwing doors been redesigned to look like shoulder buttons on a gaming controller?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gullwing doors in Image B appear unchanged in their overall design and function as the iconic doors of the car model. They do not mimic or resemble shoulder buttons typically found on a gaming controller, which are small and shaped to fit the index fingers. The doors remain distinct as car doors with the unique upward swinging style.",

      "question": "Has the front grille been transformed into a directional pad (D-pad) control layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front grille in Image B maintains its form as a typical car grille. A D-pad is a cross-shaped button used for navigation in gaming, and there is no such transformation visible in the grille's design. The grille is consistent with being part of a car's aesthetic and functional design, rather than resembling any gaming controller element.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the car exhibit a sleek metallic red finish with visible gloss highlights across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image B and Image A, the car displays a metallic red finish imbued with gloss, which enhances the vehicle's sleek appearance. This gloss is apparent on the surfaces, catching light and emphasizing the curves and shape of the car, a common aesthetic feature of sports cars.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there intricate emblem details present on the dashboard area that resemble button controls or gaming-themed insignias?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of digital graphics on the side inner panel (near the driver's seat area) appears to resemble a gaming interface or digital readouts, with vibrant colors and a design that mimics controls or insignias from gaming contexts. This suggests a thematic attempt to integrate gaming elements into the car's interior design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a branding logo on the hood that is shaped like a central control element (e.g., a circular button or interface symbol) for a futuristic gaming identity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a design added to the hood, which is not present in Image A. This new design could be interpreted as resembling a central control element or symbol commonly used in gaming interfaces, given its circular, emblematic style and central positioning on the hood, suggesting a futuristic gaming identity.",
