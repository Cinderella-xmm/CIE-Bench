      "question": "Does the building now feature visible brass gears integrated into its exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building prominently displays several brass gears integrated into its exterior, which are a characteristic feature of the steampunk style. The large visible gears are not part of a typical architectural design and are clearly an addition meant to enhance the steampunk aesthetic, indicating they were not present in Image A which lacked such features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there copper-colored funnel-shaped structures present on the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows multiple copper-colored funnel-shaped structures as part of the building. These elements again contribute to a steampunk aesthetic, a stylistic choice that often includes industrial and Victorian-era machinery elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the original glass dome been replaced with a dome featuring intricate metalwork patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome of the building appears to have been replaced or covered with intricate metalwork patterns. This is evident from the visible circular and gear-like designs which suggest a more industrial or steampunk style as compared to any typical glass dome structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the moon in the sky replaced by one or more giant clock faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a building with giant clock faces on its facade. However, the moon is still visible in the sky; it has not been replaced by clock faces. The clock faces are part of the building itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are rivets visibly present on the clock faces and/or the building's exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The close examination of Image B reveals numerous rivets on the clock faces and across the building's exterior. These are typical design elements used to imitate industrial machinery aesthetics, which aligns well with the depicted style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there visible steam or vapor emitting from parts of the building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there are no visible signs of steam or vapor emitting from any part of the building. The elements visible in the image are static, with no indication of movement or emission.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the transformed building clearly visible in the water below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of the transformed building, including its prominent gears, clock faces, and additional details, is clearly visible in the water below. This reflection maintains the clarity and integrates the changes applied to the building itself.",
