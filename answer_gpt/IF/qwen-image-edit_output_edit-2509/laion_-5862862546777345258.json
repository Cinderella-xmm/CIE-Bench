      "question": "Is the entire church and square scene enclosed within a visible baroque-styled dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene appears to be enclosed within a glass dome, visible due to its transparent nature and the highlight reflections on it. The underlying base exudes a design consistent with baroque styling, featuring ornate carvings. This comprehension is arrived at through the visual cues of dome-like shape and styling on the base, supported by the world knowledge of baroque aesthetics.",

      "question": "Is the church depicted with a glossy, white or off-white porcelain-like surface featuring intricate painted or molded details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On examining Image B, it portrays the church with a surface that, while not explicitly glossy or porcelain-like, resembles the consistent color and molded detail common in miniature dioramas. There are no explicit indications of a glossy shine consistent with porcelain.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures appear small relative to the scene but retain color and detail consistent with painted diorama figures rather than metallic gray pewter. Visually, they do not exhibit the uniform gray color or sheen characteristic of pewter.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire diorama placed upon a visible base made of textured, veined, or aged-looking marble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the entire scene on a wooden base with ornate carving, not a marble base. The texture and color indicate it is crafted from wood, characterized by its intricate designs, which is a typical style found in crafted decorative pieces.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tables in Image B are depicted as part of the miniature diorama and do not appear to be made of glass. They have a solid, non-transparent appearance typical of painted resin or plastic used in dioramas, without the reflective quality of glass.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the trees possess an atypical enhancement for dioramas with a transparent quality. Though they bear resemblance to ornamental glass trees, no internal details or realistic refractive properties indicating substantive glass artisanry ensure adherence to typical diorama. However, the characteristics align a glass-like look.",
