      "question": "Has the overall form of the statue been reshaped into a recognizable perfume bottle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object held above the figureâ€™s head has the refined appearance of a perfume bottle stopper, but the rest of the statue maintains its original form rather than reshaping into a perfume bottle. The distinct attributes of the statue, such as the figure's detailed clothing and positioning, remain intact.",

      "question": "Has the jug been replaced with an ornate glass stopper positioned at the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object held in the statue's hand transformed into an ornate glass stopper. This change is consistent with how a perfume bottle would feature a decorative stopper for its opening.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robe in Image B continues to exhibit the details and folds typical of a fabric garment rather than being transformed into a streamlined and elegant bottle shape. The general form and texture of the statue's robe have not been altered into a bottle form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly defined goose-shaped charm present as a decorative element on or near the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue still features the goose figure with its consistent appearance next to the main figure. However, there doesn't appear to be a charm separate from the goose itself used as an ornamental bottle accessory.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B displays earthy tones like brown and terracotta, but gold accents are visible on the goose, which has patterns in gold. The visual presentation includes a combination of these colors, creating a warm, classical look.",
