      "question": "Have the cabinet and sink been converted into five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls placed in the bathroom, which replace some objects present originally. One large doll replaces the cabinet on the wall, and four smaller dolls are placed either on the sink or around it, while one large doll stands at the bathtub. In Image A, the cabinet and sink were standard bathroom furnishings without any nesting dolls. The transformation indicates that, visually, they have been converted into chibi-style Russian nesting dolls.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from biggest to smallest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of nesting dolls does not follow a strict order from biggest to smallest. There is one large doll on the wall, and another large doll near the bathtub, with other smaller dolls scattered on the sink and bathtub edge. Therefore, the sequence does not transition seamlessly from largest to smallest as one might see in a traditional nesting arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned along the edge of the bathtub?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two nesting dolls are placed directly on or very near the bathtub â€“ one large on the edge of the bathtub itself and another small one close by, however, the rest are around the sink area. They do not line up together along the bathtub edge but are rather scattered between the bathtub and sink area.",

      "question": "Is the aspect ratio of the edited image maintained at 3:2 horizontally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the overall composition and dimensions seen in Image A, suggesting that the aspect ratio is unchanged at 3:2 horizontally. The orientation remains consistent with a standard photographic framing, which appears to align with the 3:2 ratio, commonly found in DSLR photography.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are vividly colorful, featuring exaggerated facial features like large eyes and oversized heads, consistent with the chibi art style known for its cute and exaggerated character representation. This stylistic choice is evident through the visual presentation of the dolls.",
