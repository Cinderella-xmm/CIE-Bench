      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a landscape that is covered with snow, which is associated with tundra-like conditions.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B still displays buildings in the background, similar to those in Image A, although now covered in snow, suggesting that these structures have not been removed. Both images depict buildings close to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which confirms their presence.",

      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa in Image B maintains the same position and angle as in Image A. The architectural details and orientation of the tower appear consistent, suggesting no alteration to its position or appearance besides the color tone.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B has been changed to a pale, uniform, and colder tone, lacking the vibrant colors typical of a sunset, as seen in Image A. This indicates that the sunset sky has been replaced with a weather condition more consistent with snowy landscapes.",
