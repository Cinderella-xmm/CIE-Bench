      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the statue appears to have a uniform color with a matte finish, which gives it a clay-like appearance. The absence of shiny reflections and the smoothness of the texture contribute to the impression of a molded clay surface. This observation is based on the matte texture combined with the common characteristics of objects made from clay.",
