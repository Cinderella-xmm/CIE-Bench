      "question": "Is the entire canal scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cue of a transparent spherical boundary is apparent, as the canal scene is encapsulated within what resembles a glass globe or snow globe. This enclosing boundary surrounds the entire scene, indicating that the answer to this question depends on recognizing the spherical shape that envelops the scene. Based on this observation, the scene is indeed enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the timber-framed houses rendered with enhanced texture detail and colored in muted autumnal tones (e.g., browns, oranges, soft reds)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the timber-framed houses do not exhibit enhanced texture detail or mediaeval colors. Instead, the colors of the houses are quite similar to real-life, with no particular shift towards muted autumnal tones. They maintain a consistent visual appearance similar to reality, without a specific stylization that uses muted colors. The world knowledge that muted autumnal tones typically involve softer and warmer shades confirms this observation.",

      "question": "Does the canal water appear glossy and reflective, resembling a polished resin surface rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of the canal water is very smooth and highly reflective, giving an impression similar to a polished resin surface, which stands out from the typical dynamic and slightly textured look of natural water bodies. The reflection is clean and somewhat exaggerated compared to usual water reflections, often mimicked by glossy materials. These visual characteristics and world knowledge of how polished resin appears contribute to the conclusion.",

      "question": "Are there scaled-down, detailed mini bridges and additional greenery (such as small plants or moss) integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays several miniature elements consistent with the overall diminutive scales of the scene, such as the bridges. This suggests a model-like quality where scaling down is involved. However, aside from the scenery captured naturally within the globe, the visual examination does not point to additional greenery or exaggerated scales beyond the original layout. Thus, the question focuses on alterations or additions not prominently visible.",

      "question": "Are there small, stylized human figures in vibrant clothing positioned along the walkways, appearing as hand-sculpted models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several small human figures in vibrant clothing are evident, resembling miniature hand-sculpted models. These figures do not appear lifelike due to their cartoonish style and placement, contributing to the idea of a diorama or snow globe scene. This observation, when combined with world knowledge about the appearance and style of such model figures, shows the integration of stylized elements.",
