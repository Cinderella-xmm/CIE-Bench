      "question": "Is the sandcastle now presented as a scaled-down, highly detailed miniature 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle appears to be a miniature version with highly intricate detailing, similar to a scaled-down model. This is evidenced by its placement inside a glass dome, suggesting it is a miniature display rather than a full-size sandcastle. The visual cues such as the proportionality with the glass dome indicate it's a small-scale representation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual presentation in Image B shows the sandcastle entirely enclosed within a spherical glass structure, indicating it is under a glass dome. The curvature of the glass and its transparency are clear markers of this feature.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
