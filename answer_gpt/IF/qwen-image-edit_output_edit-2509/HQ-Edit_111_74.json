        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the kimono have a distinctly shiny appearance, resembling gold foil.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hair displays a range of colors that seem to shift under the light, analogous to iridescence. This is suggested by the presence of varied colors, such as blues and purples, creating an effect that mimics the way iridescent surfaces reflect light.",
