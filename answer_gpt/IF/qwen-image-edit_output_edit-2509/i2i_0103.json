      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit prominent, visible brushstrokes throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the image features thick, swirling lines that mimic brushstrokes prominently. This effect is noticeable across the entire composition, from the sky and clouds to the elements in the foreground like the sofa and plant. The style resembles the impasto technique, associated with expressive brushstroke visibility, which is characteristic of Van Gogh's work. Therefore, the edited image exhibits prominent visible brushstrokes throughout.",

      "question": "Are there distinct, exaggerated differences between light and dark areas in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a high contrast between light and dark areas, with exaggerated transitions visible in the vibrant sky, which shifts dramatically from deep blues to bright yellows and oranges. This is further emphasized in the highlights and shadows cast across other elements like the sofa and lamp, highlighting a heightened distinction between light and dark. Such exaggerated contrasts are typical of expressionist works like those of Van Gogh.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elements within the edited image, such as the sky, clouds, and landscape, display swirling patterns or dynamic lines characteristic of Van Gogh's style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features swirling patterns and dynamic lines throughout its entirety. This is prominently observed in the sky and clouds, where each element flows with circular movements and vibrant line directionality. Such patterns are indicative of Van Gogh's renowned style, particularly reminiscent of his 'Starry Night' painting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in the edited image are much more vibrant and expressive compared to what typically would be a realistic palette. The blue tones of the wall and sofa, as well as the yellow hues in the sky and lamp, are intensified, creating an emotionally expressive atmosphere that diverges from the realism of the original Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire image, from the sky to the foreground objects, uses swirling patterns, expressive brushstrokes, and vibrant colors, all hallmarks of Van Gogh's work. Each element of the edited image consistently applies these techniques, showing a stylistic uniformity that reflects Van Gogh's artistic style throughout Image B.",
