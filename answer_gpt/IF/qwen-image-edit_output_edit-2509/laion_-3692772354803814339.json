      "question": "Does the bottle appear as a transparent crystal vessel with visible swirling ocean wave patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is transparent and has a design that resembles ocean wave patterns inside it. The swirling design gives an appearance of water movement, which is different from a regular bottle design. This visual cue, along with the common understanding of crystal bottles often being clear and decorative, suggests that the bottle does look like a transparent crystal vessel with such patterns.",

      "question": "Is the label replaced with intricate golden maritime symbols instead of the original text and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle with golden symbols that have a maritime theme. This is a change from the standard text and typical branding found on product labels. By examining the golden symbols, which do not convey brand information like text would, it's clear that the label has been transformed into a design focused on maritime symbolism.",

      "question": "Has the packaging been transformed into a parchment-like scroll with aged texture and scroll-like edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be the packaging has been replaced with a scroll design, featuring a parchment texture and rolled edges. This gives it an aged, antique look typical of scrolls. Common knowledge tells us that scrolls are characterized by their cylindrical shape and rolled ends, which matches the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the top of the packaging feature a compass rose with metallic-looking directional points set against a parchment background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the scroll-like packaging in Image B exhibits a compass rose design. The directional points in the compass appear metallic and contrast against the parchment-style background, providing a navigational appearance. The compass rose is a common symbol used for direction and fits well with the maritime theme, indicating that the packaging incorporates this design element at the top.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bottle and packaging exhibit ethereal qualities such as glowing edges, light refraction, or a mystical aura consistent with an elixir vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle displays a luminous appearance, with glowing effects and refractions within the glass. The wave and symbol designs enhance this ethereal effect, suggesting a mystical aura. The scroll packaging complements this with its antique, enchanted appearance. These qualities together evoke the feeling of a magical or elixir-type vessel, rather than an ordinary beverage bottle.",
