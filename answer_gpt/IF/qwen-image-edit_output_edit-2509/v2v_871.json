      "question": "Is the image vertically oriented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orientation of the objects and their layout within the frame must be observed. The glass cube containing the figures is placed on a base, suggesting a portrait alignment. This arrangement typically allows the display to be clearly seen in a vertical manner, reflecting a portrait orientation.",

      "question": "Has a traditional LEGO minifigure been added next to the pear-inspired animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to the left of the pear-inspired animal, there is a LEGO minifigure standing. The distinct blocky structure, iconic shape, and proportions are identifiably LEGO minifigure characteristics. This indicates the presence of a LEGO minifigure next to the animal.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the pear-inspired animal feature a polished, seamless style with a bitten section that complements the pear's characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an object on the left that resembles a pear with a bitten section. The surface has a smooth finish, typical of a polished object, and the bitten section aligns with the pear's design. This consistency between the sections confirms that the object maintains a seamless style matching the pear's characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both figures enclosed within a transparent glass cube that reflects the natural wood grain look and color of the backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are enclosed in a transparent cube, clearly visible. The cube acts like a protective display case. While the backdrop appears more like a smooth, gradient surface, it does not mimic a natural wood grain. Therefore, the cube is there, but it does not reflect the natural wood grain look.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image utilize sophisticated lighting with warm hues that align with the original photo's tones, and does the background transition smoothly from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is warm, accentuating the objects with gentle shadows and highlights consistent with the original's tone. The background exhibits a gradient transition from a rich caramel to a lighter cream shade, enhancing the depth and warmth present in the image. This reflects a sophisticated use of lighting and shading.",
