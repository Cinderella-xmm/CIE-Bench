      "question": "Is the husky depicted as a plush toy rather than a live animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky has characteristics indicative of a plush toy: it has a uniform color texture typical of manufactured fabrics, artificial stitching lines particularly visible around the head, and poses that suggest it is an inanimate object. Common features such as glossy eyes, an exaggeratedly simplified snout, and overall rigid posture further support this conclusion. Therefore, the husky in Image B is depicted as a plush toy.",

      "question": "Do the husky's paws appear significantly larger and more exaggerated than those of a real husky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paws of the husky are round, large, and notably simplified in shape, which is consistent with the design of plush toys where limbs are typically exaggerated for cuteness and manufacturability. This over-emphasized roundness is not a natural characteristic of real husky paws, which tend to be more proportional and anatomically articulated.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fur texture been replaced with a soft, velvety fabric appearance throughout the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the husky with a distinct fabric texture that mimics plush toy materials; the surface has a uniform, smooth velvety appearance that is commonly used for stuffed animals. This differs from the natural fur texture seen in real animals that typically exhibit varied lengths, directions, and strands.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly the eyes, rendered as embroidered details rather than realistic ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the husky's eyes are represented in a stylized and simplistic manner, indicative of embroidery or fabric printing commonly seen in plush toys. The eyes have a fixed, uniformly blue look without natural details or reflections typical of real animal eyes, reinforcing the conclusion of the features being embroidered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plush toy placed on a clean wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the husky plush toy sitting on a flat surface that appears to be a wooden shelf. The texture and appearance of the surface suggest clean, smooth wood, and its indoor placement aligns with a typical display scenario for toys or decorative items.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background minimalist, without any natural elements like snow, trees, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed minimalist, characterized by a simple, solid, light-colored wall. This is contrasted with Image A, which features a vibrant outdoor scene including trees, snow, and sky elements. The absence of these natural elements in Image B suggests a minimalistic environment, typical for indoor photography settings or product showcases.",
