      "question": "Is the chocolate tower redesigned into a box-shaped structure resembling a festive tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is clearly observed as box-shaped with triangular outlines reminiscent of a Christmas tree. This is in contrast to Image A, which is a tower-like structure. Image B is a more traditional representation of a tree through its pyramid-like shape, differing from the intricate and multi-layered tower in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible cutout windows in the structure that reveal chocolate layers inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has distinct triangular cutout windows on its surface, through which the chocolate layers embedded with nuts are visible, giving a glimpse into the contents within. This was not a feature in Image A, which displayed chocolates and decorations directly on the outside of the layers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is gold foiling visibly applied to the surface of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon closely examining Image B, there is no evidence of gold foiling visibly applied to the surface. The design features elegant motifs and a structured layout but lacks any explicit gold finish on the exterior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are intricate nut embellishments present on the surface of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the viewable chocolate within the cutout windows is decorated with nuts, but the exterior surface of the package itself does not have actual nut embellishments; rather, it contains decorative designs. This contrasts with Image A, where nuts are part of the visible design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B displays a subtle sparkle effect, indicative of festive design. This is evident through the small golden dots dispersed throughout the background, resembling a sparkling finish, enhancing the decorative appeal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any brand signature at its base or elsewhere on the visible exterior of the package when viewed straight on, while Image A has a clear brand signature around its bottom. The focus in Image B is on the decorative and festive appearance rather than brand labeling here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays the name “ChocoConifer Delights” on the base of the packaging, indicating the product's branding and theme, which is a deviation from Image A, where the base of the structure bears a brand name instead.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes decorative motifs that are elegant and seasonal in design, with swirls and ornamental patterns in deep brown hues. These motifs enhance the festive appearance of the packaging, distinguished from Image A's focus on an actual chocolate structure.",
