    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laboratory scientist is illustrated in a semi-cartoon style as evidenced by the simplified lines and proportions commonly used in cartoon or animated designs. This contrasts with realistic depiction, which tends to focus on intricate details and proportions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laboratory apparatus in Image B are simplified and stylized, consistent with cartoon design, lacking the intricate detail and sharp clarity that would be present in a more realistic depiction focusing on refinement.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features headers with a somewhat futuristic or tech-inspired font style above each monthly section, although they lack glowing or metallic effects, indicating an attempt at modern design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various data visualization patterns like circular diagrams can be observed, integrated along with scientific motifs into the calendar design, emphasizing the scientific theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not demonstrate characteristics of a polished or reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper; it maintains a more matte, semi-cartoon look typical of illustrated designs.",
