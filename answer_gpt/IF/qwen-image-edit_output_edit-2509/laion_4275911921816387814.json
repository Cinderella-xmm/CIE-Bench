    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dagger now rendered as a soft, plush toy rather than a rigid weapon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object visually resembles a toy because of its rounded and smooth contours, lack of sharp edges, and the textile-like appearance of the materials. Common sense suggests that these are characteristics of a soft object like a plush toy, rather than a metal weapon.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blade made of soft, silver-gray fabric with black embroidered patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade shows a gray pattern that looks textured and textile in nature with embroidered-like black patterns. These visual cues, coupled with the common understanding of fabric patterns and textures, suggest that the blade is indeed made of soft, silver-gray fabric with embroidery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hilt made of a soft, faux ivory-like fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hilt in Image B appears to have a creamy, soft appearance similar to that of fabric, and the light reflects off it as if it is a plush material, rather than rigid ivory. This suggests the use of a material that mimics ivory but is actually soft, indicating faux ivory-like fabric.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all edges of the plush dagger, including the hilt and blade, appear rounded and smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the dagger, both at the hilt and the blade, are visibly rounded and smooth, contrasting with the sharp, defined edges typical of a real dagger in Image A. This transformation suggests a plush form where edges are softer and safer.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the plush dagger appear stuffed and voluminous, with softened contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall contour of the object in Image B is bulged and rounded, without the tight, sharp angles of a real weapon. This appearance reflects characteristics of stuffed objects, such as plush toys, where the material is filled to create volume and softness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the plush dagger placed against a solid-colored backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly shows the dagger against a plain, solid blue background, which provides consistent and uninterrupted visual contrast that is typical when displaying singular objects to highlight them clearly.",
