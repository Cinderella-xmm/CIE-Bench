      "question": "Are there five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls representing the individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are five Russian nesting dolls displayed next to the TV. They seem to be designed in chibi-style with exaggerated features often found in such depictions. These dolls are likely representations of a person or character, based on their stylized appearance. The presence of five distinct dolls designed to represent an individual character aligns with the classic concept of nesting dolls, where each fits into the next size up.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls sized from biggest to smallest in a progressive manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the five nesting dolls are arranged from left to right in a way that indicates a progressive decrease in size. This arrangement is typical for Russian nesting dolls, representing a sequence from largest to smallest. Each doll visibly decreases in size relative to its neighbor, following the traditional design.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls accurately reflect the individual's attire and stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls display intricate attire and a variety of poses typical of stylized representations rather than directly depicting the individual seen in the original image. While certain elements could reflect the individual's attire or stance, such as color themes or general design, the dolls are more likely to be generic or decorative in their depiction rather than precise copies of the individual's outfit and stance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are placed on a wooden table directly next to the TV. They sit side by side in an orderly fashion, evenly spaced and aligned along the table's surface. This arrangement fits the description of them being displayed neatly.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain an aspect ratio of 3:2?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine the aspect ratio of Image B, visual cues of the overall dimensions in height and width can be analyzed. While precise measurement through visual inspection isn't possible, the image of the edited version appears rectangular, possibly indicating a common photographic aspect ratio like 4:3. However, it seems to closely approximate a 3:2 ratio as it's slightly longer than it is tall, which is typical for standard photograph formats.",
