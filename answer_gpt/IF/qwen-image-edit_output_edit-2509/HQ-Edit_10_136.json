      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a cartoonized style with exaggerated features and an enlarged strumming hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the girl is indeed presented in a cartoonized style. This can be seen in the simplified and smooth lines outlining her figure and facial features. The artistic rendering creates a less realistic portrayal, often found in cartoon styles. However, her strumming hand does not appear enlarged or exaggerated compared to the rest of her body. This indicates a stylistic approach that focuses more on the overall cartoonized look rather than extreme physical distortion of specific body parts.",
