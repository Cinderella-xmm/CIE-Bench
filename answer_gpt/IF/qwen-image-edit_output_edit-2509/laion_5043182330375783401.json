      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the pose with arms crossed is maintained in Image B, the facial features such as the mustache and closed eyes are not clearly visible.

This transformation is significant in aligning with the artistic theme of the edited image.",
