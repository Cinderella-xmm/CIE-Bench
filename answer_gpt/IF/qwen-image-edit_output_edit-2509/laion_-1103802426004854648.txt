    "Question": "Q1: Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse has a distinct shiny and reflective surface with a glassy appearance. This reflects light and shows transparent qualities, consistent with glass rather than a soft and matte finish typical of plush fabric found in toys. These visual cues strongly suggest it is made of glass.",
