      "question": "Is the black checkmark pathway depicted as tangled and circuitous?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the checkmark pathway is obscured by a chaotic series of black lines that give the impression of a tangled and circuitous path. This alteration suggests complexity and difficulty in navigating the process visualized by the checkmark pathway, a departure from the clear, straightforward path depicted in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 'We verify your Document' icon show multiple overlapping stamps of approval?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the 'We verify your Document' icon with the addition of multiple overlapping stamps, suggesting repeated verification or excessive bureaucratic approval layers. In contrast, Image A shows a single icon without any additional stamps, conveying a simpler verification process.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visual motifs of entangled red tape woven through the orange circular step markers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays red scribbles over the orange circular step markers, resembling entangled red tape. This visually implies bureaucratic hurdles and complications often associated with excessive administrative processes. Image A shows clear orange markers, signifying straightforward steps without entanglements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chaotic black lines, overlapping approval stamps, and scribbles indicating 'red tape' in Image B collectively suggest increased bureaucratic complexity, contrasting with Image A's streamlined presentation which suggests a simpler process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite efforts to depict complexity in Image B, the added elements cause visual clutter and reduce overall clarity, making it harder to understand the steps depicted, compared to the clear and coherent presentation in Image A.",
