      "question": "Is the image presented as a series of separate stamp-like elements arranged in a grid or collection format, each resembling a paper-cut design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image is presented within a frame that bears a resemblance to a stamp or a bordered paper-cut design, characterized by scalloped edges and surrounding borders, often associated with stamps. However, there is no visible series or grid arrangement in the image. The image itself appears to be contained in a single frame rather than multiple stamp-like elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral embroidery details on the hanbok enhanced with visible metallic foil effects (e.g., shiny, reflective highlights)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanbok’s floral embroidery details exhibit vibrant colors but lack visible metallic foil effects such as shine or reflective highlights. This is compared to Image A, where floral details are present but, likewise, do not showcase metallic effects. The change in vibrancy does not correspond to metallic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the bow on the hanbok been visibly enlarged compared to its original size in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image B with Image A, the bow on the hanbok appears consistent in size, without any visible enlargement. Both images show a similarly proportioned bow size relative to the hanbok, indicating no alteration in size between the original and edited images.",

      "question": "Is the traditional Korean architectural background clearly visible and properly integrated into the overall composition of the stamp series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the traditional Korean architecture as an integral and clear part of the composition. It is framed and properly aligned within the bordered design, harmonizing with the hanbok’s appearance, whereas Image A showcases the background naturally without any framing. Image B effectively integrates the architecture within the ensemble.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire stamp series displayed on a surface that resembles embossed leather with visible texture and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the scene contained within a frame that resembles embossed leather, with visible texture and depth around the edges. This leather-like feature is absent in Image A, which does not include such textural details or depth.",
