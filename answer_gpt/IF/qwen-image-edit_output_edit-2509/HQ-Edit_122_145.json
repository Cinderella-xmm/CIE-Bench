        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted in a chibi style, which is characterized by exaggerated proportions such as oversized heads, large eyes, and simplified body structures.

      "question": "Are the floral patterns and bows on the kimono significantly more vibrant and exaggerated in color and size compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns and bows are depicted with bright, vibrant colors and appear larger and bolder compared to typical designs. This exaggerated and stylized depiction is a common feature in the chibi art style, aiming for a more expressive and visually striking appearance. In Image A, the floral patterns and bows on the kimono are more subtle and realistic, adhering to a traditional representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly four separate images of the chibi character, each in a unique pose corresponding to holding a cherry blossom branch, catching petals, gazing at blooming trees, and dancing amidst falling flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed four distinct images of the chibi character, each demonstrating unique poses. The poses, however, don't match the exact descriptions provided, except for holding a cherry blossom branch. The characters are engaged in various interactions with cherry blossoms, but each pose is not specifically defined as catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing, according to the given descriptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the four images depict a clear and distinct action—holding a branch, catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing—with visible movement or interaction with cherry blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four characters each engage in some form of interaction with cherry blossoms, such as holding a branch or having blossoms around them, which depicts various actions. However, these actions don't distinctly align with the specific activities of catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing, with visible interactions but not explicit movements described by the question.",

      "question": "Are the four fridge magnets displayed together on a single pastel-colored surface that appears to be a magnetic sheet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the four chibi character images on a pastel background, which could be interpreted as a single surface. However, there is no explicit evidence that this surface is a magnetic sheet used for fridge magnets. The imagery suggests a flat, unified presentation but lacks indications of magnet functionality.",
