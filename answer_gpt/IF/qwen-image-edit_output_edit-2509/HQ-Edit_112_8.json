      "question": "Is the phrase 'Stories Through Time' present in the image using an elegant serif typeface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase 'Stories Through Time' is clearly visible at the top. The typeface used has distinct features like serifs, which are small projections off the main strokes of a character. These features are characteristic of serif typefaces, which are commonly associated with elegance. World knowledge tells us that serif typefaces are often used for formal and classic aesthetics, matching the theme presented in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a distressed gold color that matches the typewriter’s metallic tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Stories Through Time' is presented in a gold-like color. The surrounding typewriter and Art Deco elements also have metallic tones, but to denote 'distressed,' one would expect a weathered or worn effect in the color. The presence of gold hints at the desire to match the typewriter’s metallic elements, yet without seeing distressed indications, this is more likely a coordinated metallic color choice rather than distressed.",

      "question": "Has a sepia filter been applied uniformly across the entire image to create an aged effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there is a uniform sepia tone across all elements, including the background, the typewriter, and the added elements. World knowledge on sepia filters tells us that these are often used to create a vintage or aged effect, giving images a warm brown tint. This effect is apparent throughout Image B, suggesting a deliberate intent to evoke historical aesthetics.",

      "question": "Are there visible swirling, translucent pages emanating from the typewriter, appearing as if stories are emerging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows swirling, ethereal forms that resemble pages or sheets of paper, floating and emerging from the typewriter. This visual effect creates the illusion that stories are literally coming to life and flowing out of the typewriter, using world knowledge that visual storytelling can use such imaginative depictions.",

      "question": "Does the image feature a decorative Art Deco-style border framing the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is surrounded by a border with geometric patterns and symmetrical designs reminiscent of Art Deco style, which is famous for its rich, decorative elements often featuring lines and motifs inspired from the early 20th century design movement. These borders frame the image, aligning with the Art Deco aesthetic typically seen in posters and vintage designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates a serif typeface, sepia tones, swirling ethereal pages, and an Art Deco border. These components collectively use world knowledge themes associated with vintage literary aesthetics: serif fonts lend formality, sepia tones suggest age, swirling pages indicate mystery and creativity, and Art Deco borders give a classic feel—creating a unified aesthetic focused on storytelling.",
