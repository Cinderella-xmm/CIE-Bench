    "Question": "Q1: Is the aircraft rendered in a stylized 3D model form rather than a photorealistic representation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the aircraft appears to be a stylized 3D model due to its presence in a controlled display case environment, which typically houses models rather than real objects. The detailed design and textures visible suggest this is a crafted representation, as real aircrafts would not fit within such a display setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the aircraft fully encased within a glass display case?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows that the aircraft is inside a rectangular structure with transparent sides, indicating it is fully encased within a glass display case. The visibility of the aircraft from all angles through clear panels and the boundary definition by the display case walls supports this observation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there visible worn leather accents on the display case?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the display case has a texture that resembles leather, evident from the material's visual cues such as color and grain. However, the leather appears new, with no visible signs of wearing or aging, like scratches or creases typically found in worn leather.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the display case have brass-colored corner fittings?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows clear metallic corner fittings on the display case that are brass-colored, contributing to the aesthetic design and structural integrity typically seen in display case craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there an engraved emblem visible on the front face of the display case?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts an emblem on the lower front face of the display case. It has a circular design and appears to be engraved, adding decorative or branding details to the case, which are commonly used in such handcrafted presentations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there small, artificial clouds placed inside the glass display case?",
    "explanation": "The interior of the display case in Image B features white fluffy shapes resembling clouds. These are artificial additions to the scene to create a thematic set-up, commonly used within display cases for models to depict a flying or airsetting without real environmental elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the aircraft oriented diagonally upward within the display case?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the aircraft shows it angled upward, resembling an ascent. This diagonal orientation is often used to depict motion or flight dynamics in model display cases, enhancing the visual impact of the representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the propellers of the aircraft show visual effects indicating they are spinning (e.g., motion blur or rotational distortion)?",
    "explanation": "The propellers of the aircraft in Image B appear static without signs of movement such as motion blur or distortion effects that would typically indicate spinning in representations or images. This suggests the model is displayed with stationary details, focusing more on the craft's design rather than its operational dynamics.",
    "answer": "No"
