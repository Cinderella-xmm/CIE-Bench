        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s outfit and overall image exhibit characteristics typical of cartoon art, such as bold outlines, simplified shapes, and vibrant colors.

This is in contrast to the realistic depiction in Image A, where the textures and details of the fabric and surrounding elements follow a more natural representation.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the outfit significantly larger or more stylized than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the outfit appear notably larger and more stylized compared to Image A. This stylization includes a more pronounced contrast in colors and a more exaggerated representation of floral elements, which is enhanced by the cartoon style of the illustration. Floral patterns in cartoons are often designed to capture attention and highlight specific design features.",

      "question": "Has the clasp of the outfit been redesigned to feature intricate patterns resembling jade in color and detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clasp in Image B shows a design that resembles jade, both in terms of color—a typical vibrant green associated with jade—and in decorative patterns that mimic the intricate detailing often seen in jade artifacts and jewelry. The redesign in Image B contrasts with Image A, where the clasp is more simplified and realistic without such jade-like characteristics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays colors that are considerably more vibrant and saturated when compared to Image A. This vibrancy is a typical characteristic of cartoon styles, which utilize enhanced color schemes to add visual impact and appeal. The original Image A, by contrast, uses a more subdued and realistic color palette typical of natural lighting conditions and materials.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear indications of detachable writing sections that feature gold foil borders. These sections are placed on a background that resembles vibrant silk, characterized by its smooth texture and rich, lustrous color. The combination of gold borders and a silk-like background suggests a decorative and formal design typical in luxury stationery or artistic illustrations.",
