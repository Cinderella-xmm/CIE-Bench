      "question": "Has the jeans been transformed into a perfume bottle shape that maintains the flared leg silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the perfume bottle mimics the flared leg design typical of the jeans in Image A. The bottle narrows at the top, similar to the waist of the jeans, and expands towards the bottom, resembling the flared leg. This analysis combines visual observations from Image B with knowledge of jean designs and perfume bottle shapes.",

      "question": "Is the bottle made of transparent glass tinted with denim blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material of the perfume bottle appears to be glass with a blue tint. The blue hue closely resembles the denim blue color of jeans, suggesting that the bottle is indeed made of transparent glass with a denim blue tint. This conclusion is drawn by combining the visual aspect of the bottle with the common characteristics of glass perfume bottles.",

      "question": "Have the back pockets been replaced with embossed metallic branding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible indication of back pockets on the perfume bottle. Instead, there is embossed metallic branding in the form of text on the front of the bottle. Comparing with Image A, where the jeans have visible back pockets, it is clear that the design element of pockets has been replaced by branding on Image B's bottle.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a silver button-style cap at the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap at the top of the perfume bottle is silver and resembles the style of a button, which is indicative of the buttons typically found on jeans. This visual detail is consistent with Image A, where the jeans also have a button at the waist. Thus, the cap on the bottle in Image B matches the description.",

      "question": "Are lace-up details present along the side of the bottle, matching the position of the original jeans' laces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle features lace-up details along its sides. These details are positioned similarly to the laces on the flare of the jeans in Image A. The lace-up details on the bottle are located at positions that would align with where the original jeans' laces were, indicating a thoughtful transformation of design elements.",
