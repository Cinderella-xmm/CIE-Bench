      "question": "Is the pigeon rendered as a plush toy with soft, rounded features and a fabric-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pigeon appears to have soft, rounded features typical of a plush toy, including a smooth and synthetic surface which suggests a fabric-like texture. This is visually indicated by the uniform and slightly shiny surface, lack of detailed feather patterns, and overall cartoonish, simplified design. These characteristics are consistent with how plush toys are typically depicted in imagery.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a vibrant blue chest and gray wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pigeon shows a distinct color pattern, with a vibrant blue chest and gray wings. This assessment is based on the noticeable color contrast and layout, which aligns with the typical simplification and vibrant color choices often used in plush toy designs to make them visually appealing and easily recognizable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there subtle feather-like patterns visible on the surface of the plush pigeon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush pigeon lacks subtle feather-like patterns. The surface appears smooth and uniform, much like a fabric, which is typical for plush toys. Such toys often forego intricate details like feather patterns due to their soft, simple construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the architectural structures in the background rendered as cookie-like forms with embossed or textured surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural structures resemble cookie-like forms, characterized by recessed patterns and textures that mimic the appearance of embossed surfaces. This is visually interpreted from the uniform tan color and the stylized, ornate design, which suggests a fantastical, edible-like construction often depicted in stylized artworks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plush pigeon positioned on a simple wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush pigeon is not positioned on a simple wooden shelf. Instead, it is sitting on an ornate, ornate structure that is consistent with the architectural theme of the image. These structures have an intricate and decorative appearance, contrasting the description of a 'simple wooden shelf'.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a clear visual contrast between the soft, plush texture of the pigeon and the hard, embossed texture of the cookie architecture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a clear visual contrast between the soft, plush texture of the pigeon and the hard, embossed texture of the cookie-like architecture. The pigeon is depicted with a smooth, rounded, and fabric-like appearance typical of plush toys, while the background architecture exhibits a hard, textured nature with detailed engravings, contributing to this stark contrast.",
