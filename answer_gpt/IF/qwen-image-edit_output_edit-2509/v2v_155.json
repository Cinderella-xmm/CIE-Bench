      "question": "Is the golden car depicted in a 3D chibi style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden car is depicted with realistic proportions and detailing typical of a standard sedan, rather than exaggerated features associated with chibi style. Chibi style usually involves oversized heads and features which give a character cute or stylized proportions. The car here maintains normal proportions, so it is not depicted in a chibi style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car look like it is emerging from the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the photo frame held by fingers gives the impression of a 3D effect, creating a visual illusion that the car is popping out from the frame, which is a technique to transition from 2D to 3D. The angle and placement make the car look like it is coming out of the frame, suggesting movement beyond the confines of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a human hand visible, grasping the edges of the photo frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, human hands are clearly visible holding the edges of the photo frame. The fingers are shown gripping the frame, indicating human interaction with the object, adding to the realism and 3D effect of the frame.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the car retained its golden color in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the car continues to have a shiny golden color, consistent with its appearance in Image A. There is no change in hue or saturation that alters the car's color, maintaining the original golden appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition from a flat 2D space to a 3D reality clearly depicted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B effectively uses a photo frame held by fingers to visually show a transition from a flat 2D depiction to a 3D perspective. The car appears to move through and beyond the frame's space, enhancing the illusion of depth which is typical of 3D visual effects. These elements clearly illustrate the transition from 2D to 3D.",
