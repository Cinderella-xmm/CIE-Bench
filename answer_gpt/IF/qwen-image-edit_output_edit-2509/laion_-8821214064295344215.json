      "question": "Are the teddy bears rendered as mosaic figurines made of small colorful tiles mimicking fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows teddy bears composed of numerous small, square tiles arranged in a mosaic pattern that simulates the texture of fur. This design is commonly associated with mosaic art, where tiles are used to create detailed imagery and texture. The visual cue of patterned tiles covering the entire bear surface indicates the intention to represent fur texture using mosaic techniques.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitted sweaters visible in Image A have been converted into patterns of tiles in vibrant yellow and turquoise colors.

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, snout) recreated using subtly shaded tiles to provide detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays teddy bear faces with carefully arranged tiles that form detailed features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and snout. The shading and size variations among these tiles contribute to the perception of facial detail and realism, which is a typical approach in creating mosaic artworks to add depth and expression.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bows appear in glossy, smooth tiles that contrast with the mosaic texture of the rest of the bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows on the teddy bears are depicted with tiles that have a shiny, smooth surface, distinct from the textured mosaic tiles covering their bodies. The glossy finish of these tiles creates a visual contrast, highlighting the bows and differentiating their texture from the mosaic elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the teddy bears placed on a simple white base, resembling a pedestal. This stark, minimalistic design acts as a neutral backdrop, commonly used in art displays to focus attention on the artwork itself without distraction.",
