      "question": "Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that replaces the teapot in Image A is indeed a cylindrical container. Rather than the rounded, traditional teapot shape seen in Image A, Image B shows a vertical cylindrical form that indicates a packaging design typically used for containing items like tea leaves or teawares. This understanding comes from recognizing the structure and form commonly associated with containers rather than teapots.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical container features floral patterns that appear to be highlighted in a golden color, resembling embossing or decorative foil.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a set of teacups which are designed to be stackable, with each cup having a matching decorative lid. This contrasts with the non-stackable, lidless teacups in Image A. The redesign not only provides a practical storage solution but also adds aesthetic value with lids that feature decorative motifs, aligning with traditions in fine dining ware.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
