      "question": "Does the image exhibit a hand-sculpted claymation style with visible textures and a three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit characteristics typical of a hand-sculpted claymation style. Claymation typically features pronounced textures and a three-dimensional effect that is akin to hand-molded figures. Instead, Image B appears to be a photograph with smooth surfaces and a realistic portrayal of elements like clothing and the rooftop, which lacks the tactile and textured quality of claymation.",

      "question": "Are the stripes on the character's costume clearly defined and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stripes on the character's costume in Image B are well-defined. However, they do not exhibit the usual characteristics of a claymation style. In claymation, one would expect a more tactile appearance, possibly with some imperfections or a sculpted quality. The stripes in Image B look smooth and precise, typical of digital or photographic realism rather than claymation.",

      "question": "Is the character's beret clearly visible and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's beret is clearly visible and is an integral part of the outfit. However, like the rest of the image, it does not display the traits of a claymation style. In a claymation style, there might be evident textures or marks from crafting tools used in clay figures. The beret in Image B is smooth and lacks these features, aligning more with realism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B maintains a European rooftop setting with realistic architectural details. However, it does not show adaptation to a claymation style. Claymation backgrounds would often exhibit a more whimsical, less precise style with visible textures, potentially appearing inanimate or crafted. The background here appears photographic, with clear lines and realistic depth.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire image, including the character and the background, consistently rendered in the hand-sculpted claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Neither the character nor the background in Image B are rendered in a hand-sculpted claymation style. The image maintains a realistic photographic style, without the texture, sculpted features, or three-dimensional effect typical of claymation. Elements like the character's clothing and the architectural details of the background lack any signs of being crafted or modeled by hand.",
