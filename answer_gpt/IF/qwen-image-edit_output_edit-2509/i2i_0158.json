      "question": "Is the front view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three-view combination of the car is presented with three sections. The first section, on the left, shows the front view of the car, which is clearly visible with distinct features such as the headlights, grille, and front bumper. The car's front view is portrayed prominently and occupies the full height of the section, maintaining clarity without any obstruction. This clear depiction indicates that the front view is indeed meant to be visible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the left side view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the middle section of the three-view combination shows another front view from a slightly different angle, rather than a side view. The angle still emphasizes the front of the car rather than showcasing the side of the vehicle. Therefore, while there are two perspectives of the front, neither present a side view.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right section of the three-view arrangement displays the rear view of the car. This section clearly shows the back of the car, including features such as taillights, the rear bumper, and the license plate area. The entire rear portion is clearly depicted without any obstructions, indicating that the rear view is effectively visible in this layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the three views of the car presented in a non-overlapping manner, ensuring they are distinct and clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the layout of the three views of the car is structured in a way that each section—front, slightly alternative front, and rear—is distinctly separated, allowing each view to be independently visible. There is no overlapping between the sections, ensuring that each view maintains its distinct presence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall presentation of the combined three-view image align with the standards suitable for car magazines or showroom flyers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presentation in Image B is clean and professional, showing three distinct views of the car: two front views and one rear view. Though two views are front perspectives, they are clearly organized, and the car is positioned in an appealing residential setting, which aligns with how vehicles are commonly presented in car magazines and showroom flyers. The layout allows for sufficient visual clarity and appeal, which are essential standards in such publications.",
