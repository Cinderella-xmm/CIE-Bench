    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that the scene, including the ship and seagulls, is encased within a glass dome. This is evidenced by the visible curvature and reflections on the glass surface, which are consistent with the characteristics of a glass dome. The dome is placed on a wooden base, further emphasizing the enclosed nature of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sails of the ship display certain qualities such as visible creases, edges, and shadows that are typical of a papercraft or handcrafted miniature. These features give the sails a textured and dimensional look as if they are made from lightweight paper or similar material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the ship, there is a blue resin layer that is translucent and appears to shimmer. This resin has a sculpted texture that resembles ocean waves, which, combined with its light-reflecting properties, effectively mimics the appearance of water.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seagulls appear to be suspended around the ship within the glass dome. While the wires are not readily visible, the positioning and stability of the seagulls suggest that they are held in place. This setup gives the seagulls a dynamic look, as if they are frozen in mid-flight.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a ship model that has been recreated in detail but at a smaller scale suitable for a diorama. The model retains key structural elements such as masts, rigging, and hull design, closely resembling the full-scale ship from Image A, indicating that these details have been carefully preserved and miniaturized.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blue resin layer under the ship has a textured surface that reflects light, creating a shimmering effect. These visual aspects replicate the look of flowing water waves, giving an impression of movement beneath the stationary ship model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the curved glass dome visibly present with clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is clearly defined by its boundaries and the way light interacts with it, causing refraction and reflection. This visible curvature and optical effect caused by the glass confirm the presence of the dome around the diorama scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
