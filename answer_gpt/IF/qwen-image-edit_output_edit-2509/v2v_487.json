        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a small, simplified, and cartoon-like figure that fits the style of a chibi character, positioned within the kayak. The chibi character is seated inside the kayak, giving the appearance of it being three-dimensional due to the perspective and shading.",
