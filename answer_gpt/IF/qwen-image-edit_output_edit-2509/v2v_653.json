      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the characters designed with large, expressive eyes and rounded, soft facial features are indicative of a chibi style, commonly enhancing cuteness through exaggerated proportions.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
