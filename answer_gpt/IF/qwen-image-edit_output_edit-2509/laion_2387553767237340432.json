      "question": "Has the texture of the vases been changed from clay to a marbled ceramic finish with visible veining and smooth surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vases in Image B have a distinctive smooth, marble-like appearance, with visible veining patterns that are commonly found in marble materials. This contrasts with clay textures, which typically appear rough and earthy with less shine. The surface of the vases in Image B appears polished, which one can logically associate with ceramic materials as opposed to clay.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays branding elements such as logos or text. There is a small decal visible on the vase itself, which likely represents the brand 'Earth Elegance.'

      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B is clearly a black box and has typography that appears bronze or copper-colored. Such color contrasts are typically used for elegance and readability on dark surfaces, and the choice of matte finish for the box supports the high-end aesthetic.",
