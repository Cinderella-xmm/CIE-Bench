      "question": "Are the weightlifter's arms significantly larger and more exaggerated in proportion compared to a realistic human figure, consistent with cartoon styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the weightlifter's arms appear much bulkier and cartoonish in nature, demonstrating an exaggerated proportion that deviates from a realistic human figure. This observation can be made through the overly muscular and rounded depiction of the arms that is typical of cartoon styles, which tend to emphasize certain physical attributes for dramatic effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing of the weightlifter features various gym-themed motifs.

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the mirror display abstract or creative shadow illustrations rather than a realistic depiction of the weightlifter and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be no mirror or reflection visible as seen in Image A, as the image instead focuses on a cartoonish depiction without showing a mirrored or reflected setting, thus, no abstract or creative shadow illustrations appear in the context of a mirror.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the weight plates on the barbell have been visibly decorated with colorful, stylized icons such as stars and other symbols. This modification from the more uniform black plates in a typical gym setting indicates a deliberate design change for artistic or thematic purposes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a strip resembling a calendar layout is clearly visible at the bottom, complete with numbers, days, and month labels. This strip appears similar to a calendar due to its grid-like organization, suggesting it may be detachable, as calendars often include perforated or tabbed pages.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is designed to look like a wooden panel with distinct wood grain and natural coloring, creating a textured look that simulates a wooden surface. This stylization serves as an artistic backdrop to the cartoonish depiction of the weightlifter.",
