      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the spaceship visually transformed into a style resembling a Greek amphora painting, with flat, stylized forms and decorative borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an object that appears to be a Greek amphora, which features flat, stylized forms and decorative borders common in ancient Greek pottery. Upon examining the image, the spaceship has indeed been transformed into this amphora style, replacing the futuristic design with one that has traditional Greek design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible stylized circular motifs incorporated into the design of the spaceship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The amphora in Image B has decorative patterns, including stylized circular motifs commonly seen in Greek pottery. These patterns are not present in Image A. Therefore, by comparing the evident designs of the amphora in Image B, it confirms the presence of such motifs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spaceship include intricate meander patterns as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Greek amphora in Image B features intricate decorative patterns, which include meander or Greek key designs typical of ancient Greek artwork. Such patterns are absent from Image A's spaceship, indicating that the transformation incorporated these elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the landscape below been transformed into elongated abstract waveforms rather than realistic terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape features elongated, abstract waveforms, deviating from the realistic terrain depiction in Image A. This transformation applies an artistic style consistent with abstract forms, rather than a literal representation of the natural landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the color palette of the landscape composed primarily of muted earth tones consistent with ancient pottery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette seen in Image B's landscape incorporates muted earth tones, resembling those often found in ancient Greek pottery. Image A's landscape captures more natural greenery. This difference suggests that the edited landscape was intentionally adjusted to echo the hues typical of pottery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B replaces the spaceship with a Greek amphora and modifies the landscape style, the spatial relationship—where the object (spaceship/amphora) hovers above a linear ground pattern—remains constant. This suggests that despite stylization, the fundamental spatial arrangement is retained.",
