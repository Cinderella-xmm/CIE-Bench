      "question": "Do the dolls have bold calligraphic outlines around them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are shown with distinct, bold outlines typical of styles like ukiyo-e or certain types of graphic illustrations that emphasize contours. These outlines are a stylistic choice used to define the edges and features of the illustrated dolls distinctly, giving them a more pronounced visual appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and hair of the dolls are depicted using flat, solid colors without gradient or texture, typical in many illustration styles where flat color is employed to create a distinct and bold visual character.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a simple landscape with minimal detail. This is a common technique in illustrations to keep the focus on the foreground subjects—the dolls, in this case—while providing enough context without distracting from the main elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the doll is shown in a ballet pose similar to Image A, wearing a light-colored tutu. This continuity suggests the illustration has preserved the original pose and attire but adapted it into an illustrative style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated doll is depicted in a pink top and is sitting on a fuchsia-colored mat, maintaining the original position and color scheme from Image A but simplified in illustrative form.",
