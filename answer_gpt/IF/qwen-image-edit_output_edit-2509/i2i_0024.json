      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a flat illustration-style tennis-themed chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual inspection of Image B, the person is depicted in a simplified, cartoon-like style typical of chibi stickers. The body's proportions are exaggerated with a smaller torso and larger head, adhering to the characteristics of chibi artwork. The use of bold outlines and flat colors further confirms the transformation into an illustration-style tennis-themed chibi sticker.",

      "question": "Is the person depicted in the same original pose as in image A?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the person is holding the racket in one hand and making a fist with the other hand, suggesting an action pose. Image B shows the chibi sticker also with one hand raised in a fist, maintaining the essence of the original pose but stylized for the chibi format. Thus, the person is depicted in a similar pose despite the stylistic transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual inspection of Image B indicates that the character is wearing a red dress and a white hat, which are consistent with the attire seen in Image A, demonstrating retention of original color scheme and accessories, despite character transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis racket simplified into a black-lined filled shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket is depicted with simplified features, particularly using black outlines to delineate its shape without detailed strings visible. This contrasts with the more detailed racket background in Image A, indicating a design simplification.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tennis ball and a white-gloved hand making a victory V-sign. However, red clay court lines which are visible in Image A are absent from Image B. Only two of these themed elements are present in the chibi sticker set.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character and accompanying elements enclosed with white borders typical of stickers. The absence of a solid background confirms that these stickers have a transparent background as traditionally presented.",
