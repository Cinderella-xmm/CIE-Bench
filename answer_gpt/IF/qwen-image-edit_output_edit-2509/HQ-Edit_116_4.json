      "question": "Is the girl depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated features such as large eyes, simplified facial structure, and stylized proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is depicted in a style that emphasizes bright colors and stylized designs. Her figure appears within a context that often associates with cartoon or illustrative styles, particularly in elements like exaggerated proportions or simplified design elements commonly found in cartoon representations. This stylization is evident in her kimono and surroundings. Therefore, while other caricature elements are amplified in Image B, the basic cartoon style with exaggerated facial features does not appear to be applied.",

        "No"

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
