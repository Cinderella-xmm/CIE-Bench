      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle design, with the overall object now resembling a candle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to have a candle integrated into its design, visible through a lit wick at the top. This candle setup suggests a transformation from conventional teapot functionality into a decorative candle holder design. From world knowledge, a teapot integrated with a candle could be seen as a unique decorative item rather than a functional teapot. Therefore, the design transformation resembles a candle setup.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object now rendered with a transparent or translucent glass-like finish consistent with a candle base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object having a non-transparent ceramic appearance, which lacks the glass-like properties. Typically, candle bases often involve glass if translucency is intended; however, the material here is ceramic, not glass-like. Therefore, despite the elegant design, the object does not feature a transparent or translucent finish.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the surface of the object exhibit a high-gloss ceramic finish instead of a metallic one?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object displays a glossy ceramic finish, apparent from its smooth texture and reflective shine typical of ceramics rather than metal. Image A features a metallic finish, while Image B transitions to a ceramic look. Ceramics hold a distinct glossy sheen distinct from metal. Thus, reflecting its high-gloss ceramic state.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been replaced with a visible wick extending from the top of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a lit wick at the top is clear, not the spout. Candle wicks typically extend from the top of candles or candle-like structures. Comparing Image A, which retains its teapot spout, Image B showcases an evident wick instead, marking a significant design shift towards candles.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a decorative gold accent rather than retaining its original functional form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle has taken on a decorative gold appearance, contrasting with Image A's functional wooden handle design. Decorative elements often involve ornate detailing like gold accents for aesthetic purposes. Image B opts for an ornate, non-functional handle element aligning with decorative shifts.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a subtle floral pattern visible around the base of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates floral patterns subtly etched around the base area of the object, enhancing its aesthetic appeal with delicate artistic designs. The floral detailing is neither robust nor pronounced, allowing it to maintain subtlety. These decorations often aim for elegance without overwhelming prominence.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" written in elegant script on the front of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front of the object in Image B showcases the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle,\" scripted in an elegant style. Script fonts often involve fluid, decorative strokes, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of such items. The elegant rendition effectively communicates the object's thematic design as a decorative candle piece.",
