        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the surface of the blue mug and the background are characterized by swirling patterns and textured strokes which are reminiscent of Van Gogh's painting style. The swirling motion and sense of movement are visual cues that strongly align with Van Gogh's use of impasto—a technique involving thick applications of paint. This analysis is made by observing the visual cues of texture and movement in the brushwork seen in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the colors in the edited image been adapted to reflect Van Gogh's vibrant yet slightly muted palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image employs a color scheme that is vibrant yet somewhat toned down, with deep blues, yellows, and greens—colors prominently used in many of Van Gogh's works. These are visual characteristics one associates with Van Gogh's style which often featured a balanced use of bold and subdued shades. This inference is based on world knowledge of Van Gogh's palette combined with the visual evidence in the image.",

      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit the textured surface typical of Van Gogh's oil paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in the edited image appears textured through the visible brushstrokes and layered colors, echoing the characteristics of Van Gogh's oil paintings. The strokes and layered appearance suggest a tactile surface which is a hallmark of Van Gogh's artwork. This conclusion is drawn from visual observation of the texture and brushwork in the image.",

      "question": "Has the original composition of the blue mug been maintained in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the composition—position, and shape of the blue mug in the edited image—has been preserved. The mug's location, orientation, and perspective remain akin to the original, with alterations primarily in style rather than structure. This comparison relies on recognizing the retained compositional elements and comparing them to the original.",

      "question": "Does the edited image demonstrate depth and layering similar to Van Gogh's techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows depth through the layered application of swirling color and varied thickness of paint strokes, simulating the dimensionality found in Van Gogh's work. The visual cues indicating overlapping brushstrokes create a sense of layering and depth. This analysis combines understanding of Van Gogh’s painting technique and visual inspection of the edited image.",
