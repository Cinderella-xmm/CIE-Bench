        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears as a figure made of material typically associated with collectibles. The polished and smooth surface of the structure, along with the consistent coloring and detailing, resemble attributes often found in soft vinyl figures. The rigidity and the styling suggest a manufactured statue rather than a depiction of a real person.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hands are holding weapons, which implies they are meant to be part of the display rather than interchangeable accessories. There does not appear to be additional parts or indications of swapping components, hence they are integrated instead of interchangeable.",
