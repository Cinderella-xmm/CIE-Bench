      "question": "Are there exactly five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues show that there are five distinct nesting dolls present in the image. This can be easily determined by counting the individual dolls visible, which are arranged in a line from left to right.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a vibrant lime-green color and texture similar to the shoe and tennis ball in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are clearly depicted with a vibrant lime-green color. This color is visually consistent with the lime-green tone of the shoe and tennis ball in Image A. Additionally, the nesting dolls appear to have a smooth texture, akin to the shoe seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from largest to smallest in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are visually organized from left to right with the largest doll on the far left and progressively smaller dolls towards the right. This arrangement logically denotes a sequence from largest to smallest in size.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B where the nesting dolls are placed has a distinct wood grain pattern and polished appearance. These characteristics are characteristic of a sophisticated wooden table, supporting the idea that the dolls are on such a surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is a plain, subtle color, which does not draw attention away from the main subjects, the nesting dolls. This contributes to a non-distracting visual environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In evaluating Image B, it seems to be closer to a 1:1 square aspect ratio rather than a 3:2 horizontal one. The dimensions appear equal in height and width, which are typical features of a square rather than a rectangular aspect ratio.",
