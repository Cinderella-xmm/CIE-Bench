      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear wooden shadow box frame surrounding the scene. The frame is distinctly visible with a wooden texture and structure that encases the entirety of the scene, indicating that the image has been presented in a shadow box format.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the tree been scaled down in size and rendered with enhanced 3D surface texture (e.g., visible bark details, depth, shading)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree in Image B appears smaller compared to the vast landscape setting of Image A. In Image B, the tree fits within the confines of the shadow box, and subtle enhancements are noticeable such as indications of bark texture and depth due to shadow effects. These edits suggest a 3D rendering is applied to add texture detail.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers (e.g., pink, yellow, blue, red) beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct patches of multi-colored flowers beneath the tree. A variety of colors including pinks, yellows, blues, and reds are visible, contributing to a detailed floral section below the tree. This arrangement aligns with the presence of multi-colored flowers.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background consist of multiple layered painted surfaces that create a sense of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to have a background where the sky and clouds are painted on multiple layers, creating an artistic sense of depth and dimension. This approach mimics how painters layer varying elements to give depth perception within a shadow box scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small clouds visibly suspended by thin wires that hang within the shadow box scene. This design choice enhances the visual sense of dimension and realism, making suspension evident through the eye-catching wires.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image include surreal or stylized elements (e.g., floating clouds, soft glow, pastel hues) that contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes surreal elements: the floating clouds suspended by wires, pastel hues of the floral field, and soft glow lighting, all contributing to a whimsical, dreamlike atmosphere. These stylistic choices are typical of art aiming to create fantasy-like scenes.",
