      "question": "Has the mango been transformed into a whimsical figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is seen as an anthropomorphized character with cartoon-like features including eyes and a smile, suggesting it has been transformed into a whimsical figurine. This is a stark contrast to Image A where the mango is simply sliced into cubes without any whimsical elements.",

      "question": "Have the cut mango pieces been slightly increased in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, in Image B, the mango has larger, exaggerated cubes on top of the figurine that give a sense of playfulness and caricature. In Image A, the mango cubes are smaller and realistically proportioned to the fruit itself. This change in appearance indicates an increase in the size of the mango pieces in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the mango pieces have a shiny 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mango pieces in Image B appear to have a glossy finish, showing reflections that suggest a shiny 3D effect. This contrasts with Image A, where the mango cubes appear matte and realistic without significant shine or 3D enhancements. This observation helps conclude that the mango in Image B has been rendered with a shiny 3D effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime and chili powder bowl each have faces with eyes and smiles, which are elements of cartoon design. These features do not appear in Image A, where the lime and bowl of chili powder are depicted realistically without any anthropomorphic or cartoon-like elements. Thus, the lime and chili powder bowl in Image B have a cartoon-like design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango, lime, and chili powder appear to be placed on a wooden shelf, distinct from Image A, where they are on a flat plate on a table. The horizontal wooden surface visible under the elements in Image B supports the conclusion that they are positioned on a shelf.",
