      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the necklace now suspended as a floating chandelier supported by ornate branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no traditional necklace as seen in Image A. Instead, there is a chandelier hanging within the glass dome. This chandelier is designed intricately and seems to float above the scene. There are no elements resembling a necklace or ornate branches in their traditional sense, thus it can be said that the necklace isn't suspended as a floating chandelier by branches.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a distinctly visible green area at the base inside the dome, resembling a pond. The color is emerald green, echoing the vibrant tone often associated with gemstones like emeralds, suggesting the presence of such a pond.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, delicate silver-colored leaves are clearly arranged around the circumference of the green pond, forming a circular decorative border, which is often seen in artistic designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snake tail appears to rise from a base within the dome that includes a moss-like texture. This texture, surrounding the pond and silver leaves, is indicative of a moss-covered feature, supporting the view that the tail emerges from such an area.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
