      "question": "Has the Eiffel Tower been replaced with a bottle-shaped object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is not visible as it was in Image A. Instead, there is a large bottle-shaped object where the Eiffel Tower was originally located. This indicates that the original landmark has been replaced with something resembling a bottle.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the structure have a transparent or glass-like appearance with embossed lattice patterns resembling the Eiffel Tower's framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B has a transparent appearance like glass. On its surface, there are patterns that resemble the Eiffel Tower's lattice framework, suggesting that these details have been incorporated into the bottle's design, creating a visual connection to the Eiffel Tower.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a gold-colored, metallic-looking base supporting the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the bottle-shaped object in Image B, there is a gold-colored section that appears metallic and acts as a base supporting the bottle. This contrasts with Image A, where no such element is present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the glass surface of the bottle, there are faint outlines that resemble various Parisian landmarks, including a rendition of the Eiffel Tower itself. This suggests an artistic overlay on the bottle displaying aspects of the Paris skyline.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the neck of the bottle in Image B, there is a small logo that appears modern and simple in design. This is a distinct addition compared to Image A, where such a feature at the top of the Eiffel Tower does not exist.",
