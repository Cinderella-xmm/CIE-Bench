      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the buildings in the skyline rendered with pixel-patterned or grid-like luminous facades resembling a digital display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings in the skyline are covered with grid-like luminous facades displaying glowing patterns similar to digital screens. This observation is reinforced by the presence of structured lines and illuminated patterns on the buildings' surfaces, which are indicative of a digital or pixelated appearance, common in representations of modern digital displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings exhibit a glowing or luminescent effect, such as bright edges, internal illumination, or radiant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings exhibit glowing and luminescent effects characterized by bright edges and internal illumination. The vibrant blue and pink colors radiate from the windows and outlines of the structures, which is consistent with features of glowing or luminescent effects typically found in digital or futuristic art styles.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the trees been replaced with glowing, angular, circuit-like structures composed of lines and nodes resembling digital pathways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows trees transformed into structures that exhibit angular, glowing forms like circuits, composed of lines and nodes resembling digital pathways. This change is evident in their bright, illuminated outline and interconnected patterns, mimicking a digital network rather than natural tree forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bridge illuminated with vibrant neon lights along its structure, creating a glowing pathway effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridge in Image B is illuminated with vibrant neon lights, which gives it a glowing pathway effect. The bridge's surface effects are characterized by bright, radiant colors projecting along its structure, aligning with common representations of neon-lit pathways in futuristic or digital art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene consistently feature futuristic technology aesthetics, such as digital patterns, glowing elements, and cybernetic design features across buildings, trees, and infrastructure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B entirely adopts futuristic technology aesthetics throughout its scene. Every element, from the buildings to trees and infrastructure such as the bridge, displays digital patterns, glowing elements, and cybernetic designs seen through luminous facades, circuit-like trees, and neon pathways. This consistent integration of tech-centric design features marks the scene with a futuristic motif.",
