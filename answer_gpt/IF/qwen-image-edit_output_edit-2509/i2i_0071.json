    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the train been transformed into a futuristic maglev train design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sleek, modern train design. Features such as the aerodynamic shape, polished surface, and lack of visible wheels suggest a futuristic design, typically associated with maglev technology. Maglev trains often exhibit these characteristics for reduced friction and higher speeds.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train retain the original white and red color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train's exterior is adorned with a white body complemented by red accents. This is consistent with the color scheme often used for modern transport design to signify speed and dynamism, matching the original description.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the train incorporate elements indicative of maglev technology?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The streamlined, wheel-less body and elevated position of the train in Image B are indicative of maglev technology, which uses magnetic levitation for movement, eliminating traditional tracks and wheels.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the train still appear recognizable as a train despite the futuristic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite its futuristic enhancements, the train in Image B maintains a recognizable train silhouette, with a linked series of compartments and a leading car, features typical of trains.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have all parts of the original train been transformed into the new maglev design, with no elements of the old design remaining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the train is a traditional design with wheels evident, typical of non-maglev trains. Image B shows a complete transformation to a maglev design with no visible elements from the original train, such as traditional tracks or wheels.",
