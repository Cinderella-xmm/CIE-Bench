      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Great Wall and surrounding mountains rendered as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall and mountains appear to be encapsulated within a snow globe, suggesting they are part of a miniature 3D model. This is inferred from the scale and arrangement inside a spherical globe, which is not typical for full-scale photographs. Thus, based on seeing these elements contained within a globe, the conclusion is that they are likely a miniature representation.",

      "question": "Is the miniature model of the Great Wall and mountains enclosed within a transparent, spherical snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues of Image B show a spherical transparent object surrounding the Great Wall and mountains. This strongly suggests a snow globe, as they are characterized by this shape and transparency, allowing viewers to see the miniature scene inside. Without comparing to Image A, the presence of the transparent sphere is a clear indicator of the snow globeâ€™s characteristic.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains small human figures positioned on the Great Wall, visible with clothing and accessories, aligning with modeling techniques used in miniature displays.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the foliage surrounding the Great Wall within the snow globe displays bright autumn colors, like red, orange, and yellow. This indicates a stylistic choice in model creations to represent seasonal scenery, enhancing the visual appeal by using vibrant colors.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside Image B's snow globe, small white particles can be seen swirling, suggesting a snowfall effect typical of snow globes. This effect enhances the perception of the globe by simulating winter weather conditions within the miniature scene.",
