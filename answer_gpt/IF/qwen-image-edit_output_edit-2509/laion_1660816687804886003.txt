    "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, continues to display the sneaker with the logo visible on the side of the shoe's upper part. As such, it confirms the presence of the brand emblem, however, since there's no can transformation, the logo is not on the front of a can.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the word 'Kickstart' written in red lettering on the white upper portion of the can?",
