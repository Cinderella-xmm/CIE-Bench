      "question": "Has the English manor-style house been replaced with a structure composed of fragmented, colorful geometric planes consistent with cubist art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house structure exhibits a pattern of fragmented, colorful geometric planes that resemble the style of cubist art. This contrasts with the original English manor-style house in Image A, which features traditional architecture with cohesive and realistic surfaces. Cubist art often incorporates abstract, fragmented shapes and vibrant colors, aligning with the observed changes in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original brick surfaces of the house replaced with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes rather than realistic masonry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the house with vibrant, non-uniform geometric planes, deviating from the original realistic masonry seen in Image A. The use of bright colors and varied shapes replaces the previous brick surface, creating a pattern that lacks the realistic texture and consistency typical of masonry, which aligns with a more abstract concept.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all individuals in the crowd been rendered as abstract, faceless, and scattered forms devoid of detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the crowd shows abstract, faceless, and scattered forms without detailed features, contrasting significantly with the detailed and recognizable individuals present in Image A. This abstraction aligns with a stylized representation, focusing on color and form rather than realistic human features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the grass surface feature a visible checkered pattern overlaying the entire green area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a visible checkered pattern overlay on a portion of the grassy area, making it stand out against the natural, uniform green seen in Image A. This artificial pattern is not typical of a golf course setting and introduces a decorative or conceptual element not present in the original image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the water reflection been transformed into a series of prismatic, angular shards that distort and fragment the image of the house and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water reflection has been altered to resemble prismatic, angular shards that create a fragmented and distorted reflection of the house and surroundings, differing from the more cohesive and realistic reflection in Image A. This transformation suggests an abstract, artistic reinterpretation of how reflections can be presented.",
