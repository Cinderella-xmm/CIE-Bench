    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the seahorse made entirely of glass material instead of plush fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse has a distinct shiny and reflective surface with a glassy appearance. This reflects light and shows transparent qualities, consistent with glass rather than a soft and matte finish typical of plush fabric found in toys. These visual cues strongly suggest it is made of glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse have a translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the seahorse in Image B appears to be pink and has a translucent nature, which gives it a glass-like quality. This is reinforced by light reflections and soft textures that could be mistaken for bubble textures, adding to its glassy appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the belly section made of opaque yellow glass with an etched music note design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the belly section of the seahorse is yellow and has reflective qualities, but it appears somewhat translucent rather than purely opaque. The music note design seems to be a part of the surface rather than etched into it, which can be confused as etching in glass materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins made of lavender-colored glass instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ribbons on the seahorse's head and fins in Image B appear to be part of the glass structure, exhibiting the same translucency and reflective qualities as the rest of the body, characteristic of glass. These properties indicate they are not made of fabric.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the seahorse placed on a reflective black display stand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse is clearly placed on a shiny, round black stand. The reflective surface of the stand is consistent with typical display stands used for ornamental objects, enhancing the presentation of the glass-like seahorse.",
