      "question": "Has the background been changed to an outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features elements associated with an outdoor camping scene, such as a tent visible in the distance and grass on the ground. These visual cues, combined with world knowledge of typical camping environments, strongly suggest the scene is outdoors and related to camping. Analyzing Image A shows an indoor kitchen setting, confirming the change.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the toasters placed on a folding table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are on a table with visible legs that have a crisscross pattern, indicative of a folding table often used in portable or outdoor settings. This conclusion is formed by combining visual cues with knowledge of common camping furniture. Image A shows the toasters on a wooden kitchen counter, providing a clear comparison that confirms the change.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there sunlight shining on the golden toast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bright and warm lighting casting on the toast, suggesting sunlight due to the outdoor setting. The lighting enhances the shininess and warmth typical of sunlight. World knowledge about outdoor settings confirming this effect further supports the conclusion. Image A features indoor artificial lighting without evidence of sunlight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the appearance and position of the toasters and toast remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the same two toasters side by side with each having a slice of toast in them, identical in appearance and position to Image A. Both images show consistent placement on respective surfaces. Visual analysis and comparison indicate that the toasters and toast positioning have remained unchanged despite the background alteration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows appear realistic and consistent with an outdoor setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears bright and natural, complementing the outdoor camping environment. Shadows from the toasters and the folding table are consistent with sunlight angles typically found outdoors. Combining visual patterns with real-world light behavior, the lighting and shadows are convincing and coherent. This contrasts with the controlled artificial lighting observed in the indoor Image A.",
