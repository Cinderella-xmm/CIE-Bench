        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras display a realistic appearance, with natural proportions and lifelike anatomy. Combining world knowledge, chibi-style figures are typically characterized by oversized heads, eyes, and simplified features, which are absent here.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts zebras with the distinctive alternating stripes characteristic of their species.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras display postures that involve lowering their heads to graze on the grass. Combining visual cues with knowledge about animal behavior, grazing is a typical, natural stance for zebras. This portrays a realistic action as part of their usual activity.",

      "explanation": "Image B has a visible addition of a decorative frame which surrounds the entire scene. The frame exhibits details typical of ornate design such as intricate patterns and carving, based on visual cues and general design knowledge. This distinguishes it from Image A where no such frame exists.",
