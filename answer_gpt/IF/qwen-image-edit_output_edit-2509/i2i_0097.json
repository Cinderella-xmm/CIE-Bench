        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a layout typical of a poster, featuring a large, central title at the top ('MASTER CHEF'), a graphic of a spoon inserted onto a stylized pot, and various other text elements and icons that suggest additional content like subtitles or descriptions, which is a common design approach for posters.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'MASTER CHEF' is prominently displayed at the top of Image B in large, bold letters, typical of how a title would be presented on a poster, indicating that this is likely the title of the poster.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Below the central image of the spoon and the pot in Image B, the text 'Final Round' appears in a significant and eye-catching font size, placed in such a way that corresponds with the location and purpose of a subtitle, suggesting its relevance to the main theme presented at the top.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the spoon from Image A is used prominently, placed vertically above the pot graphic, but the plate is notably absent. Instead, the spoon is used thematically in a different composition, suggesting the poster emphasizes the spoon as a central theme rather than including the entire original setup.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases various design elements like bold font choices for the title and subtitle, stylized graphics such as the spoon and pot, and additional culinary-themed lines such as steam icons and accented flames, all of which contribute to the theme of a cooking competition.",
