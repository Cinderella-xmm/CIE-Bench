      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower is depicted with a significant height relative to its base, creating an exaggerated and elongated appearance.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized representation of the clock tower surrounded by a geometrically arranged flowerbed. The different segments of color indicating flowers are depicted using geometric patterns, enhancing the cartoonish and abstract quality of the design. This presentation aligns with a stylized illustration purposefully using simple lines and shapes to show complexity.",

      "question": "Does the overall structure of the edited image appear as a vertical metal badge with a glossy enamel coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a vertical design, illustrating the clock tower and its surrounding flowerbed as part of a badge-like appearance. The use of glossy enamel colors is evident in the vibrant hues and smooth surface. This polished finish suggests a metal badge, commonly achieved via enamel coloring in the creation of such items.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the prominent features of the badge-style illustration are set against a neutral, solid background. This background is white, highlighting the stylized colorful representation of the clock tower and its surroundings without interference from external designs.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B applies simplified, cartoonish designs reminiscent of the chibi-style often seen in artistic and design contexts. This involves the use of bold outlines, basic geometric shapes, and vivid colors to recreate the clock tower and flowerbed in a manner that underscores its caricatured essence.",
