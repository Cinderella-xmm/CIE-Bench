      "question": "Does the edited image display a cartoonish or animated visual style with exaggerated proportions and simplified forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate a cartoonish or animated style due to the bright, unrealistically vibrant colors, the exaggerated proportions of the lollipop-like trees, and the simplified forms characterized by bold outlines and lack of detailed textures. These elements are common features of cartoonish or animated artistry.",

      "question": "Are the outlines of the church simplified and exaggerated, with bold lines and minimal fine architectural detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is depicted with bold outlines and lacks the intricate architectural details seen in realistic depictions. The forms are simplified, which is indicative of a more cartoonish representation that focuses on exaggerated yet clear forms rather than realism.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass windows are depicted using bright, vivid colors and stylized patterns that are not typically seen in realistic stained glass. Instead of detailed and intricate designs, the patterns are simple and bold, fitting with the overall animated style of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no natural pine trees present. Instead, the area surrounding the church is filled with objects resembling candy, such as large lollipops. This transformation from real trees to candy-themed elements aligns with the cartoonish and fantastical style of the edited image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky features a swirling pattern composed of pastel colors, resembling a patchwork quilt rather than a natural sky. This stylistic choice enhances the whimsical, animated atmosphere of the scene and deviates significantly from any realistic depiction of a twilight sky.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church remains centrally positioned on the winding path, similar to its placement in Image A. However, the surrounding environment has been transformed from a natural forest to one filled with candy-themed elements, maintaining the central positioning of the church within the fantastically altered setting.",
