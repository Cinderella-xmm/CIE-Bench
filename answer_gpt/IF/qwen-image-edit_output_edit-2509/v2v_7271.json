      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the laundromat and the person holding laundry, depicted using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the scene appears to be constructed from elements that suggest a Lego aesthetic. The person, clothing, and environment have a shinier, uniform surface that typically characterizes plastic, resembling Lego bricks, supporting the depiction of the entire scene in a Lego-style format.",

      "question": "Are the person and the folded laundry represented as Lego figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure of the person and the folded clothes appear stylized with a smooth, shiny surface typical of plastic Lego figures, rather than depicting realistic textures, indicating they are represented as Lego elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the laundromat environment, including the walls, doors, and washing machines, constructed using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The environment in Image B, including walls and structures around the laundromat, seems constructed with a smooth, uniform texture and reflects a stylized design that suggests a Lego brick-like construction instead of realistic textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the scene have a static, constructed appearance typical of a stop-motion diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a scene where the texture and styling of the elements give off a static and structured look akin to a stop-motion diorama, wherein figures and settings appear crafted from similar material, characteristic of such diorama setups.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Has the overall scene composition been maintained while adapting it to the Lego aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image A and Image B, the composition (position of the person, laundromat, and laundry) remains consistent. However, the adaptation in Image B focuses on transforming textures and materials to fit a Lego aesthetic while the basic composition remains the same.",
