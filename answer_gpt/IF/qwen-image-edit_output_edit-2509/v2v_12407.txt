    "Question": "Q1: Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a mango with blocky pixelation, which suggests it is based on the 8-bit graphics style known for its pixelated appearance. This style typically uses large square pixels that are visibly distinct, creating a retro digital look. The pixels in Image B are clearly discernible around the mango's edges and features, indicating 8-bit graphics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the table and napkin show pixelation that implies low-resolution rendering. The napkin appears as blocky shapes rather than detailed fabric, and the table surface has a simplified appearance with visibly large pixels. This is typical of 8-bit graphics where details are abstracted and minimalistic due to technological limitations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a limited color palette with distinct, solid colors and few gradients. The mango is depicted using flat colors with sharp edges, common in 8-bit graphics where the color range is restricted to maintain two-dimensional simplicity and reduce complexity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses flat shading on the mango and table, which is characteristic of 8-bit graphics. Shadows and highlights are rendered in solid blocks of color without gradual transitions, producing a simplified representation that mimics the shading techniques used in early digital media.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
    "explanation": "The composition in Image B prioritizes basic shapes and forms, lacking detailed textures. This simplification is consistent with 8-bit graphics, where complexity is reduced to suit the pixelated style. The mango is represented as a basic geometric form with minimal additional textural detail, focusing on essential shapes over intricate design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
