      "question": "Is the green field depicted as a floating island disconnected from any ground or horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the land is clearly floating above the clouds, with no connection to the ground or horizon, implying it is a disconnected floating island. The depiction includes distinct edges and the land is in the sky, which signifies it is separate from any usual landscape or horizon. In Image A, the field is grounded with common horizon elements such as a sky and distant scenery typical of being rooted in the ground.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers significantly more vibrant and saturated in color compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are depicted within a surreal setting. They possess bright and vivid colors accentuated by an artificial light source or enhanced by digital illustration techniques. Comparing this to Image A, the flowers appear more natural in their hue and saturation, likely consistent with real-world colors. This indicates a notable increase in vibrancy and saturation in Image B.",

      "question": "Has the moon been replaced with an oversized apple in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of the moon, there are two apples stacked above one another floating in the sky. This contrasts significantly with Image A, where the moon is clearly visible as part of the celestial scenery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the bee and butterfly been replaced with stylized, playful, non-realistic motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the insects displayed are caricatures or stylized versions with exaggerated features that deviate from realistic representations. In Image A, the bee and butterfly are presented in a more naturalistic style, aligning more closely with real-world appearances. This difference indicates the stylized nature of the motifs in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the tree been replaced with a hollow geometric structure (e.g., cube, pyramid, or sphere) with visible interior or transparent parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a hollow geometric structure resembling an arch or pyramid rather than a traditional tree. In Image A, a typical tree is part of the landscape, showcasing standard organic shapes and traits. This substitution supports the answer that Image B features a geometric structure in place of the tree.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the starry night sky with visible stars and cosmic depth still present and dominant in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cosmic background with stars remains dominant and prominent, similar to Image A, where the night sky with stars forms a significant portion of the visual composition. This consistency indicates that the cosmic theme is preserved between the two images.",
