      "question": "Does the edited image contain only the girl, the stone platform, and the frisbee without any other distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual indicates only the presence of the girl holding a frisbee, standing on a stone platform with a vast expanse of grass and sky in the background. There are no signs of other objects or elements seen. This results in a clean and distraction-free composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a wide expanse of grass and a blue sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a background comprising a broad, flat grassy area and a clear blue sky. These elements are consistent with the description of grass and sky, suggesting a replacement from what might have been a different background originally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the composition of the edited image adhere to the golden ratio principles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While assessing for adherence to the golden ratio, it's noted that Image B places the girl roughly in the center, with significant negative space on either side. The primary elements (the girl, the frisbee, and the horizon) do not specifically follow the traditional golden ratio guidelines, which typically involve more dynamic placements within the frame, so it suggests the composition does not use the golden ratio.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects mentioned are the girl, the frisbee, and the stone platform. Observing Image B, no additional objects or elements are visible in the image that distract from these main components, ensuring the frame remains uncluttered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing Image B, its clean and simple composition with a high-quality depiction of the primary subjects suggests it would be beneficial for use as photography training data. It adheres to the described conditions of clarity and relevance, making it a suitable candidate for such purposes.",
