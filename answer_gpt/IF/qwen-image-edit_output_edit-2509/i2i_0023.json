      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison of Image A and B shows no alteration in relative sizes; the arrangement maintains proportional size of the boy's head and birds from the original photo, indicating no resizing was conducted for composition purposes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features thick white outlines bordering the boy and the birds, a stylistic element used in sticker-like illustrations to separate the main image from surrounding space and create a distinct, polished look.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that Image B lacks any visible background elements and is isolated against a non-distracting spatial context, it suggests transparency, which is common in digital illustrations intended for versatile applications.",
