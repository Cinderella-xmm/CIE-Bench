      "question": "Is the tall ice tower in the foreground rendered with pixelated textures and visible circuit-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall ice tower is represented with a glowing blue appearance and is covered in circuit-like patterns. This design gives it a pixelated texture that is emblematic of digital or technological aesthetics, often used to convey a futuristic or virtual style. The presence of these circuit-like patterns clearly indicates that the ice tower is rendered to fit a digital theme.",

      "question": "Is the Sydney Opera House represented using glowing neon lines instead of solid surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Sydney Opera House outlined with vivid neon-like lines, creating a digital or cyberpunk atmosphere. These glowing lines replace the solid surfaces, giving a distinct aesthetic that resembles wireframe modeling commonly found in digital and virtual art representations. This choice of visualization distinguishes it from the traditional solid form observed in traditional photography.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves in the ocean composed of geometric shapes rather than realistic water ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean appears to be composed of linear and geometric patterns, separating it from the natural, undulating water ripples typically seen in realistic ocean images. The arrangement of these lines mimics digital or abstract art styles, where geometric shapes represent natural elements, contributing to the digital aesthetic of the entire image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the drink on the left appear as a transparent, floating hologram with visible depth and light distortion effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drink in Image B is represented with digital lines and circuitry patterns, along with a luminous effect that suggests transparency and a holographic appearance. While it does appear as part of the digital theme, it doesn't completely match the description of a 'floating hologram' with light distortion effects, as it remains grounded on a surface much like in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a unified futuristic digital aesthetic, with all elements (ice tower, Opera House, ocean, drink) transformed according to their specified styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a consistent digital aesthetic across all elements: the ice tower is depicted with circuit-like patterns, the Opera House with glowing neon lines, the ocean with geometric waves, and even the drink with digital textures and luminescence. These transformations contribute to a cohesive futuristic digital theme that spans the entire image.",
