      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box cover in Image B prominently displays the words 'Voyage of Vitkengs' in a bold and clear font.

      "question": "Is the circular knotwork pattern from the sail used as part of a game board layout, such as a grid or path system, within the box artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the artwork featured in Image B, the circular knotwork pattern is solely on the ship's sail and does not appear to be used as part of the game board layout. The in-game board displayed beneath the ship features a grid with identifiable sections, but the knotwork is not part of that design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small, stylized figures along the side of the Viking ship, which are likely meant to represent rowers or crew typically found in board games with such themes. These figures also appear on a section of the game board within the cover artwork, indicating the incorporation of these figures as part of both the ship design and gameplay representation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side panels of the game box in Image B have a texture that resembles wood, showcasing a grain pattern.
