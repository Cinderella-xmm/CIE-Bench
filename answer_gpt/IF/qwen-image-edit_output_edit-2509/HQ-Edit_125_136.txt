{
    "Question": "Q1: Is the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” present in the image?",
    "explanation": "The title 'Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics' is visible at the top of the image. This is determined by looking at the large, prominent text that clearly denotes the focus of the infographic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?",
    "explanation": "The astronaut and space station in the image are represented with cartoon-like, simplified vector-style graphics. This style typically features flat colors and minimal detail, differing from photorealistic images that include intricate details and shading. This observation is based on the block colors and simple shapes used in the illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the spacesuit include visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns?",
    "explanation": "The images show a cartoon-style illustration, and the spacesuit lacks detailed textural elements like stitching or fabric patterns that would be present in a photorealistic depiction. This suggests an emphasis on simplicity and abstraction.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are gold accents used in the image to emphasize certain elements such as labels, borders, or arrows?",
    "explanation": "Gold accents are indeed used to highlight important elements like text and arrows, as seen in the step descriptions and arrows guiding the sequence, which are colored in a gold hue to stand out against the dark background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there three sequential stages illustrated with arrows showing the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station?",
    "explanation": "The infographic includes a clear sequence from 'Step 1: Prepare' to 'Step 3: Operate,' with arrows indicating the progression from one stage to the next. This design element suggests the step-by-step process related to the astronaut's actions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the labels “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, and “Step 3: Operate” displayed in sequence along the bottom of the image?",
    "explanation": "The infographic shows these labels at the bottom corresponding to each stage of the process, reinforcing the sequential guidance provided in the visual layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the entire infographic arranged in a vertical format with elements stacked from top to bottom?",
    "explanation": "The image is arranged horizontally rather than vertically, as the steps and illustrations are placed side by side, showing a sequence from left to right rather than stacking elements vertically.",
    "answer": "No"
