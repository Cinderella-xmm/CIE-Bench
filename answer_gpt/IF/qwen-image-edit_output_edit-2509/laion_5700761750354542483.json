      "question": "Is the butterfly now made of soft fabric instead of metallic or gemstone materials?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings and body appear to have a texture resembling fabric, specifically plush or velvety material. This contrasts with any metallic or gemstone materials that typically have a hard, shiny appearance and distinct surface definition. The fabric texture infers softness through visual elements such as the fluffy edges and sewing patterns visible, suggesting a transition from hard to soft material.",
