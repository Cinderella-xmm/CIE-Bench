      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there is clear visibility of footwear with high heels, styled with ski-like details. The footwear appears to have ski elements as their base and the vivid patterns similar to the original skis.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the footwear carries the same bright, colorful, and intricate patterns originally seen on the skis in Image A. The pattern continuity suggests that these vivid designs are incorporated into the footwear, maintaining a visual link with the original objects.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show elements that resemble wood grain textures on the footwear, specifically on the heel and toe areas. In Image A, hockey sticks had a distinct wooden texture.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features footwear that creatively combines high-heeled boots with the vibrant patterns and the shape of skis.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the footwear appears to combine elements such as high-heel structures with ski-like details and wood textures, which are not typically associated with conventional footwear. This suggests the use of unconventional materials or styling choices, especially when considering the original materials - skis and hockey sticks - are transformed into a fashion context.",
