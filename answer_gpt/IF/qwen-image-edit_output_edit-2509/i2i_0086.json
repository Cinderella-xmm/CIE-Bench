      "question": "Has a butterfly been added above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a visual inspection reveals a large butterfly prominently featured in the central region of the mirror's surface. This addition is significant and conspicuous within the edited image, where previously in Image A, such an object does not exist. The observation relies strictly on the altered content in comparison to a standard, unobstructed mirror reflection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butterfly golden in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the butterfly is rendered in a gold hue, reflecting light in a manner consistent with metallic or richly pigmented surfaces, which aligns with common knowledge about gold's characteristic color and shiny appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the butterfly placed above rather than beside or below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is positioned at the upper segment of the mirror's surface, centralizing its location within the circular frame. It is neither on the edges nor the bottom area, signifying an 'above' placement, which can be confirmed by reference to common spatial orientation terms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the butterfly blend naturally with the lighting around the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights the butterfly against a backdrop of soft light emanating from the mirror's edges. The warm tones of the butterfly's golden hue complement the ambient lighting, creating a cohesive visual effect suggestive of intentional design harmony.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly's golden color fits within the bathroom's overall design theme, where warm lighting and subtle decor elements create a sophisticated look. Its placement in Image B aligns with the aesthetic of the space, where each element is carefully chosen for its contribution to the visual environment. Thus, it remains harmonious with the decor.",
