      "question": "Has the timer on the left been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is clearly an object resembling a robotic dog sitting on top of the left parking meter. This object matches typical design elements of robotic creatures, such as segmented body parts, which are distinct from a traditional timer. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the original timer has been replaced with an illustration of a robotic dog.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robotic dog clearly shown holding a coin in its paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the robotic dog perched on top of the left parking meter is visible with its front paw holding a coin. This is indicated by the round shape of the coin and the paw's position gripping it. Therefore, the dog is clearly shown holding a coin in its paws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the parking meter still display billing information such as numbers and labels in a legible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows that despite the addition of the robotic dog, the parking meter retains its original numeric and label information display. The billing details are clearly visible and legible, verifying that this functionality remains unaltered in the visual content of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall shape and structure of the parking meter remained consistent with the original design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison between Image A and Image B reveals that aside from the addition of the robotic dog, the structure and shape of both parking meters remain unchanged. The positioning, form, and design elements like the housing, display, and coin slot are consistent with the original design in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the robotic dog designed with features such as metallic textures or mechanical parts, making it identifiable as a robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog figures show distinct elements like segmentations, smooth metallic textures, and articulated joints typical of robotic toys or models. These mechanical features make it recognizable as a robotic dog, differentiating it from a real or cartoonish dog figure.",
