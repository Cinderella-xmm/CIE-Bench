    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the pug depicted as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a living dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted resembles a pug but is characterized by features consistent with a sculpture rather than a living creature. The material appears solid and has a uniform color, indicative of wood. Moreover, the lack of texture associated with fur and the sheen typical of polished wood suggests it is a carved wooden sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the fur been replaced with smooth, polished wood grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the pug is smooth and exhibits characteristics of polished wood grain. The typical texture of fur present in a living dog is absent, replaced by a continuous surface that mimics the appearance of wood, confirming the replacement of fur with wood texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sculpture consistent with walnut tones, maintaining the original pug's color pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B presents a color that is consistent with the rich, brown tones often associated with walnut wood. The uniformity of this color throughout the sculpture maintains a sense of natural wood rather than attempting to replicate the varied color patterns of a pug's fur.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and features represented by etched or carved lines rather than soft skin folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the pug are depicted using carved lines. These lines delineate the eyes, mouth, and other characteristic features, as opposed to soft, natural skin folds seen in actual pugs. This use of carved lines is a typical technique in wood sculpture to represent texture and details.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden pug placed on a simple black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture of the pug in Image B is resting on a base that is flat and black in color. The base's simple design and dark color provide a foundation that contrasts with the wood's texture and color, typical of how sculptures are often displayed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the black base provide a stark contrast to the rich wood texture of the sculpture, emphasizing its craftsmanship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black base in Image B stands out against the warm brown tones of the wooden pug sculpture. This contrast between the deep black of the base and the detailed wood texture of the sculpture helps to highlight the craftsmanship and emphasize the artistic qualities of the sculpture.",
