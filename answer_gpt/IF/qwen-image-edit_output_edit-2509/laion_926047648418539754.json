      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall image has transformed from a realistic photo to an illustration with clear geometric patterns and a stylized appearance. The dress has intricate geometric designs that mirror the aesthetic of 1920s Art Deco fashion illustrations, which are often characterized by angular, symmetrical lines and bold stylization. The shift from realism to illustration supports the notion that it is consistent with Art Deco fashion illustrations from that era.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoes in the edited image remain platform sandals without any alteration to a T-strap design. T-strap shoes were popular in the 1920s for their elegant and supportive design, typically featuring a strap crossing the foot. Since the sandals do not resemble this vintage style or offer a T-strap design, the shoes do not match the 1920s vintage look.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
