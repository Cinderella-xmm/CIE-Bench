      "question": "Does the edited image include the apple's current front view as originally shown?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple's front view is shown in two parts of the collage: the bottom left and the top left. Based on common sense, the front view is identified by the visibility of its rounded shape and the stem protruding from the top. This coincides with how an apple is typically displayed, and is visually consistent with Image A's apple view from the side, where the shape and stem are clearly shown.",

      "question": "Is there a cross-section view of the apple that shows its inner flesh texture and seeds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays a cross-section view of the apple in the top right part of the collage. This part reveals the apple's inner flesh texture, characterized by its smooth and cream-colored appearance, and also shows the core with seeds. This direct view from the top down through the apple's middle provides an accurate depiction of the inside.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image contain a top view that clearly displays the apple's stem structure and calyx area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, none of the views provided give a top-down perspective that distinctly showcases the stem structure and calyx area. The apple's views shown focus on the sides and a cross-section, not having the typical top view orientation needed to observe these features directly.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the current front view of the apple remained unchanged compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The front view of the apple in Image A is displayed in Image B in the bottom left and top left parts of the collage. The apple's front view, characterized by its color, shape, and stem position, visually corresponds between the images, indicating the portion has remained identical in representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cross-section of the apple reveal both the flesh texture and seeds accurately?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's collage, the cross-section view in the top right part accurately shows the apple's flesh texture and seeds. This depiction provides an accurate representation commonly seen in apples, where a creamy inner texture and a few seeds are visible, lending authenticity to the visual information.",
