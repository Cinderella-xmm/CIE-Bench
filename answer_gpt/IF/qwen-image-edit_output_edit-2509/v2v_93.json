      "question": "Is the thermometer depicted in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer indeed appears to be rendered in a 3D style consistent with a cartoonish aesthetic. This can be inferred from the exaggerated and smooth shading, which enhances the depth and visual appeal typical of 3D artworks. The details emphasize bold outlines and bright, uniform colors. Such stylistic choices are characteristic of a cartoon rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image use soft lighting to highlight the thermometer's metallic finish and clearly visible dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears designed to emphasize the 3D and cartoon aesthetic, rather than to specifically highlight a realistic metallic finish and clearly visible dial. The textures and shading convey a cartoonish representation rather than realistic material properties. Therefore, based on this style and the nature of the depiction, the emphasis is not on realistic soft lighting as it would be in a photograph highlighting metallic finishes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] clearly incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text ‘Temperature Range +200°C’ and ‘Accuracy +10°C’ are prominently displayed on the card surrounding the thermometer in a clear and legible manner. These stats are intentionally integrated into the card’s design as additional features, ensuring they stand out to viewers reading the image. This is evident from their placement and the strong font that contrasts well against the background.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a banner at the top that explicitly reads 'Precision Thermal Gauge.' This title is set within a prominent frame designed to catch attention. The use of contrasting colors and bold fonts contributes to the visibility, ensuring that the purpose and name of the instrument are immediately identifiable.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a nameplate at the bottom that indicates the item's designation as 'Thermonneter'. The stylistic presentation and location at the card's base are typical features of such descriptive labels on informational cards.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a neatly bordered area surrounding the entire card, creating a clear separation between the card's content and any outer elements. This border ensures that the card and its information are presented in a framed and polished manner, which is suitable for card-based designs like this.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B uses shades of blue, which are typically associated with cool tones that evoke a sense of professionalism and scientific precision. These color choices align with the thematic intention of conveying an image that is scientific or technical in nature, using subtlety and visual harmony to enhance the image's perceived purpose.",
