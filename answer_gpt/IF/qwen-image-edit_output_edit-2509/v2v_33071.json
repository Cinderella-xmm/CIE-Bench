      "question": "Has snow been added to the clock tower and the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower and the surrounding area are covered in white, fluffy material that resembles snow. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge that snow typically falls in cold, wintry settings, indicates that snow has been added. Snow is often represented in art and real life with distinct white coloration and fluffy texture, which is evident here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the flags been replaced with icy patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flags on either side of the clock tower exhibit patterns that resemble snowflakes in a light blue color. Snowflakes and icy patterns are commonly associated with winter and cold climates. The visual change from a simple flag design to a more intricate snowflake pattern supports the conclusion that the flags now represent icy patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the overall scene reflect a winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of snow on the clock tower and the surrounding area in Image B, along with flags displaying snowflake patterns, reinforces the notion of a winter scene. World knowledge tells us that snow and snowflakes are prominent indicators of winter weather, thus, these elements combined signify a winter setting in the overall image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there visible snow accumulation on the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows white material collecting on the rooftop and ledges of the clock tower, mimicking the appearance of snow accumulation. This visual cue aligns with how snow builds up on surfaces during snowfall in a wintry setting.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparison to Image A, where flags have green and yellow stripes, Image B features flags with light blue and white snowflake patterns. The stark contrast between the familiar striped design and the intricate icy patterns marks a significant change, indicating a winter theme.",
