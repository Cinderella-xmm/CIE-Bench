        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the most prominent text at the top center of the image reads 'IDEAL HOME,' which is a common format for a magazine cover title, making it immediately noticeable. Analyzing the visual cues, this text is large and bold, indicating its purpose as a main cover title.",

      "explanation": "In Image B, the text immediately below the main title resembles section headings that might refer to content typically found in home design magazines.
