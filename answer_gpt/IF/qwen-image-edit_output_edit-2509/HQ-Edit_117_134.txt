    "Question": "Q2: Is the surface of the piano sculpture uniformly colored in a rich caramel hue instead of glossy black?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie piano displays a distinctive coloring consistent with baked goods, particularly resembling a rich caramel tone due to its brownish-orange hue. This contrasts with Image A, where the piano's surface exhibits the deep glossy black finish expected from a typical grand piano.

    "Question": "Q3: Are there visible white and gold icing designs on the cookie piano that replicate the ornate details of the original piano?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cookie piano adorned with icing designs that are intricately detailed, incorporating patterns and textures commonly seen in cookie decoration. These designs bear a resemblance to but do not exactly replicate the ornate gold detailing seen in Image A, which relies on actual material ornamentation. Therefore, while similar in decorative intent, the specific replication isn't precise, focusing more on decorative artistry suitable for a cookie rather than authentic replication.",
