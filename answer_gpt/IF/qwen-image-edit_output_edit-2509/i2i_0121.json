      "question": "Does the character display exaggerated chibi proportions with a larger head and smaller body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits typical chibi-style proportions where the head is significantly larger compared to the rest of the body, and the limbs and body are minimized in size. This style is often used to express cuteness and is common in animated designs. By combining common knowledge of chibi proportions with the visual cues in the edited image, it is clear that the head-body ratio supports the presence of exaggerated chibi proportions.",

      "question": "Is the character standing on a shell-shaped base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a shell-shaped base is visible as the foundation directly under the character. The character's feet appear to be standing on this base, which resembles a shell, consistent with the general theme of nautical or beach-related items. Analyzing the visual cue of the distinct shell outline in the edited image, coupled with the world knowledge of different decorative bases, confirms the character stands on a shell-shaped base.",

      "question": "Does the chibi version retain the character's straw hat, red jacket, and cheerful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is observed wearing a straw hat, a red jacket, and has a cheerful expression, which aligns with their typical depiction. The straw hat and red jacket are distinct elements of this character design, and the character’s facial expression retains the smiling, cheerful look. By combining the observed attributes with knowledge of the character's signature style, it is evident that these features are maintained in the chibi depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the character’s features (like buttons on the jacket and belt) simplified but still recognizable in the chibi design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons on the jacket and the belt are depicted in a simplified manner compared to more realistic designs but are still clearly recognizable. The simplified details are typical in chibi renditions to emphasize cuteness while retaining recognizable attributes. By analyzing these simplified visual cues and cross-referencing with typical chibi design characteristics, it is clear these features remain identifiable despite their stylized form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base clearly visible under the character's feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell-shaped base is prominently visible beneath the character's feet. The visual presence of the detailed shell form confirms it is meant to serve as a base upon which the character stands. Analyzing the direct line of sight of the base beneath the feet further supports its visibility and the intended design positioning, affirming that it is clearly visible.",
