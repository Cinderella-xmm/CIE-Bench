      "question": "Are all makeup brushes replaced with sculpted crystal wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects appearing as sculpted crystal wands are visible in a container. World knowledge of crystals suggests they have a reflective surface and a clear, geometric design which can be seen in the wands. Image A visual cues depict makeup brushes characterized by bristles, distinct from the solid, clear structure of the wands in Image B. Hence, the original content has been replaced by these wands.",

      "question": "Does each crystal wand have a unique gemstone at its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several crystal wands each topped with differently colored gemstones - blue, green, red, purple, etc. The clarity and individual colors suggest unique gemstones. Image A, conversely, does not feature such elements. With the varying designs and colors, it is reasonable to conclude that each wand tip sports a distinct gemstone.",

      "question": "Is the container a transparent crystal vase with visible etched floral patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame for the crystal wands is a transparent container displaying floral patterns, which are characteristic of etched crystal designs due to their clear visibility and intricate design. Image A's container is a plain glass cup. Given the ornate patterns present in Image B, it is rational to identify the container as a crystal vase.",

      "question": "Has the lace band been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a ribbon-like structure around the container that appears solid and features detailed carved patterns, similar to how crystal might be worked. World knowledge suggests that a lace band would be flexible and woven, whereas the visual cues in Image B point to a stiff, intricate structure similar to carved crystal. In Image A, a lace band is visually apparent. Therefore, the lace band has been replaced in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the entire arrangement placed on a mirrored surface that reflects the crystal vase and wands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the arrangement on a surface that provides a clear reflection of the vase and wands. The clear reflection suggests a mirrored or highly polished surface that allows light and image reflection. Image A also shows the arrangement on such a reflective surface. Given this mirrored perception in Image B, the answer is affirmed.",
