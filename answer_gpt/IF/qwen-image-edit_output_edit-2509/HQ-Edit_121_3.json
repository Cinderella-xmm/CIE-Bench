      "question": "Has the butterfly been transformed into a creature that visually resembles a floral being, with no recognizable insectoid body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly has been artistically transformed where traditional insect body parts are absent. Instead of an insect body, it exhibits floral elements such as petals and a stalk-like structure, visually resembling a flower rather than a typical butterfly. The use of floral shapes and colors emphasizes the transformation into a floral being.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings have been artistically edited to appear as vibrant, petal-like structures. The original flat and membranous insect wings have been replaced with a portrayal of overlapping petals with vivid coloration, contributing to the flower-like illusion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the butterfly in Image B has been transformed into a thin, upright structure that mirrors the appearance of a flower stalk. The traditional segmented torso of an insect is replaced with a design that includes elements such as leaves and tendrils, characteristic of a flower stem.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, plant-like tendrils are extended from the tips of the antennae, enhancing the overall transformation into a floral creature. These tendril-like details are added to seamlessly integrate the elements of a flower.",
