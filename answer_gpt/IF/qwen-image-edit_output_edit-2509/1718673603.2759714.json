      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, major elements such as the house, trees, and moon are outlined with thick, black, continuous lines, emulating the lead came used in stained glass art. This distinctive outlining helps each element stand out clearly in the composition, consistent with stained glass techniques.",
