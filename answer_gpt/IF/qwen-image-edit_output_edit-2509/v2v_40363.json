      "question": "Is the entire image composed of small, distinct mosaic tiles with visible grout lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire surface appears to be made up of small square blocks distinct from each other, and there are visible lines separating these squares. These visual cues, combined with the typical characteristics of mosaic artwork which consists of small tiles joined together with grout, lead to the conclusion that the image is composed of mosaic tiles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vivid and saturated, particularly the red heart balloon and the child's features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the colors such as the blue background, yellow patches, and especially the red heart balloon, appear very bright and intense. This saturation is a typical enhancement seen in mosaics or digital artworks, where colors are exaggerated to give a vivid appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the heart balloon and the child clearly defined and emphasized in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline of the heart balloon and the child, including features like the hand and hair, are very clear and bold. This clarity is often achieved in a mosaic style by using the contrast between tiles and grout to delineate shapes and forms more explicitly, enhancing definition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and all essential elements from the original image been maintained in the mosaic version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing both images, it is clear that the essential elements, including the child reaching out to a heart-shaped balloon, have been preserved. The composition with its central elements is intact, showing a faithful representation of the original image in a different style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the material of the artwork reflect the characteristics of ceramic mosaic tiles, such as a glossy or matte finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an appearance that could be attributed to ceramic mosaic tiles, with a visible surface texture characteristic of either glossy or matte finishes. The slight shine and finish typical of ceramic materials are evident in the visual cues presented, suggesting this representation.",
