      "question": "Does the image include a depiction of the dog from its left side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the dog clearly shows a view from the left side as observed from the position of the dog's nose, overall facial features pointing into the scene rather than out of it, and its tail pointing backward. The scene includes the dog's head, body, and tail from a left side perspective.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog illustrated from its back view within the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes the dog depicted from its back view, as seen by the rear-facing position of the ears, back, and legs. This angle shows the tail and the backside of the dog positioned away from the viewer, indicating a back view that one would commonly understand for a rear perspective on objects or entities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are both the left side and back views of the dog combined into a single image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the left side view and back view of the dog are clearly depicted and separated into distinct scenes, suggesting they are contained in one overall image. This reasoning follows visual cues where the dog is shown in two positions within the same visual frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dog shown on the bed in both the left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dog positioned on the bed from two viewpoints: the left side and the back view. In both sections of Image B, the dog is lying on the bed, evident by its position and the bed structures seen on each side. This alignment suggests consistent placement, indicative of the dog's bed presence in both scenes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bed and bedsheet appear consistently in both views of the dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, we can observe the bed's wooden frame and green bedsheet are clearly identifiable in both the side and back views of the dog. Despite the different angles, the visual attributes of the bed remain consistent, such as style, color, and positioning, indicating continuity across both views in this single image.",
