      "question": "Are the structural lines of the cabin composed entirely of geometric shapes with no organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin is depicted with clear geometric shapes, consisting of straight lines and defined angles typical of stylized architectural renditions. Geometric shapes are emphasized without any presence of organic curves, reflecting a design style focused on symmetry and structured form. Thus, the structural lines of the cabin are indeed composed entirely of geometric shapes, lacking organic curves.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a glowing, radiant circle with visible light rays or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky features a large circle above the cabin, which could represent the sun rather than the moon. It is depicted with radiating straight lines emanating from the circle, which give a glowing effect. However, it does not resemble a traditional moon with a glowing halo effect but rather an illuminated sun with geometric rays typical of Art Deco designs. The style does not convey a moon with natural halo effects; instead, it uses structured radiant patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the plants rendered in symmetrical, patterned arrangements instead of natural growth forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plants in Image B are depicted in a stylized manner, arranged in geometric, symmetrical patterns alongside the cabin. This depiction shows a deliberate and repetitive arrangement, aligning with decorative art styles, rather than portraying natural, spontaneous growth forms. Such patterned arrangements are characteristic of graphic art and not representative of how plants grow naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are metallic textures and colors (gold and silver) visibly applied to key elements such as the cabin frame, windows, or decorative motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a prominent use of metallic colors—gold and silver—applied throughout the design, evident in the cabin's structural frame, window designs, and decorative motifs. The metallic textures are part of the artistic execution, emphasizing an Art Deco aesthetic with shiny, metallic visual elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there abstract, geometrically shaped clouds present in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky features clouds that are drawn with distinct, geometric outlines, appearing abstract and stylized rather than realistic. These clouds are consistent with the overall geometric theme of the image, providing a decorative background element with structured, line-based shapes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows in Image B are designed with bold and dynamic features, incorporating thick frames, angular lines, and distinctive radiating patterns. These elements emphasize the symmetrical and decorative nature of the Art Deco style, which often features such vivid architectural details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a design synonymous with Art Deco, characterized by its flat, graphic quality, strong symmetry, and angular lines. The emphasis on decorative elements, such as the sunburst, geometric patterns, and stylized plant forms, further defines the Art Deco poster style, creating a balanced and ornamental layout.",
