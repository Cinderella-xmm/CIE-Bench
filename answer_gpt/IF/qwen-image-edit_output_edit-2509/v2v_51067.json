      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van has a bright teal color around its main body and a white color on the top portion of its bodywork, creating a distinct and vibrant two-tone paint job. This is visually distinct and stands out as a non-monochromatic design and the combination of these colors is often used for a beach or coastal theme. Therefore, based on the visual cues of vibrant teal and white, the van does indeed feature a two-tone paint job.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the van's grille and its wheels show shiny, reflective surfaces which are characteristic of chrome materials.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
