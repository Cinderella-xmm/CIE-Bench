        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout of the mirror and faucet appears identical to that in Image A. Both images feature a centrally placed mirror with lighting around it and the faucet directly below the mirror, integrated onto a similar dark countertop. This similarity indicates that the layout of these elements has been retained between Image A and Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows walls with classical Roman characteristics, such as columns with ornate capitals, reminiscent of classical architecture. The walls in Image A, in contrast, display a modern, minimalist design with smooth grey tones. Given the classical features present in Image B, the wall materials have been changed in accordance with classical Roman architectural aesthetics.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is consistent with a stylistic ambiance that complements the classical Roman architectural elements, with warm pendant lights reminiscent of historical lighting setups. Image A features similar pendant lights, but lacks the classical Roman ambiance due to its modern surroundings. While the light fixtures themselves may not be altered, the edited scene in Image B leverages them to enhance a classical aesthetic. Thus, the lighting atmosphere has been modified to fit this aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a potted plant with lush greenery sits in a classical Roman-style environment, which is typical in classical designs for adding organic contrast and aesthetic balance. Image A features sparse greenery placed on the countertop without distinct classical styling. The inclusion and positioning of plant decor in Image B contributes to the classical atmosphere, indicating a stylistic change to match the aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently includes features characteristic of a Roman-style bathhouse, such as classical columns with ornate capitals and a structured layout that evokes historical bathhouse design. Image A lacks such classical architectural details and instead displays a contemporary design style. The presence of these distinct Roman-style elements in Image B confirms its alignment with a Roman-style bathhouse scene.",
