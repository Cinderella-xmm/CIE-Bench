      "question": "Are there visible flames gently flickering from the wingtips and tail of the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing the bird in Image B, one can notice vivid flames extending from both the wingtips and the tail. These flames exhibit a dynamic appearance consistent with how fire generally behaves, which is further emphasized by their contrast against the relatively calm, snowy background. This visual cue alongside common depictions of mythical birds like a phoenix supports the conclusion that there are indeed flames flickering from these areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the bird's plumage been replaced with iridescent, shimmering scales instead of solid red feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's body is adorned with a textured surface that suggests the presence of scales rather than traditional bird feathers. The scales appear to have a shimmering, reflective quality, which is distinct from the uniform red plumage of a cardinal typically seen in Image A. This transformation aligns with common artistic representations of mythical creatures where scales replace feathers to add a fantastical element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there distinct fiery patterns (such as flame-like designs or glowing lines) visible across the bird's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B displays vivid, flame-like patterns across its body that exhibit an inner glow, contributing to the striking appearance of fiery designs. These patterns are drawn in a way that mimics the undulating shapes of flames, which are distinct and deliberate additions to the bird's form, indicating a transformation from the plain feather arrangements in the original Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bird's eyes appear as glowing embers with a warm, luminous glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing the eyes of the bird in Image B, they are depicted as glowing brightly, reminiscent of embers or fiery cores. This luminescent quality gives life to the eyes in a way that suggests warmth and intensity, a departure from the more natural, opaque eyes one would expect in a real-world bird, akin to what would be seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the branch now made of twisted, dark, glossy obsidian material instead of natural wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B appears to have a dark, glossy sheen with twisted formations that are suggestive of obsidian or a similar stone-like material, contrasting sharply with the natural wooden appearance of the branch in Image A. This transformation is visually reinforced by the shine and dramatic curves that distinguish it as an artistic interpretation, diverging from natural textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the blossoms on the branch depicted as burning or emitting flames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blossoms attached to the branch are clearly depicted with flames, as they appear to be on fire with visible flames emanating from them. This creative choice adds to the fantastical scene, contrasting starkly with the typical appearance of blossoms in Image A that would naturally be free of any fire or heat indication.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the burning elements (flames, glowing parts) clearly visible in contrast to the falling snowflakes in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The burning elements, including flames on the bird and blossoms, as well as the glowing patterns on the bird, are vividly contrasted with the gentle, white snowflakes falling in the background of Image B. This contrast highlights the mythical nature of a phoenix, where the elements of fire stand out against the peaceful, monochrome snowy setting typical of winter, making the burning components clear and visually prominent.",
