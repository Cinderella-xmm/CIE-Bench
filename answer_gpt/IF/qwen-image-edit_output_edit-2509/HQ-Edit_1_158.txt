    "Question": "Q1: Is the image presented as a mounted card with visible borders and a card-like format?",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the figure rendered as a silhouette with intricate, decorative cut-out patterns characteristic of paper-cut art?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of the person is entirely in black, with detailed cut-out patterns throughout the figure's outfit, resembling paper-cut art. These patterns add a decorative aspect, which is a hallmark of such artistic techniques. In contrast, Image A displays a realistic depiction of the person, without any silhouette-effect or intricate cut-out designs.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the book held by the figure noticeably larger than normal proportion, appearing exaggerated in size compared to the person?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the book appears normally proportioned to the silhouette, as paper-cut designs do not inherently exaggerate proportions of objects. In Image A, the book is held naturally and does not appear exaggerated in size compared to the figure. Therefore, there is no indication of the book being depicted with an exaggerated size in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the background bookshelves simplified in detail (e.g., fewer books, less depth) but still show subtle textural elements like grain or aging?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows bookshelves rendered with minimal detail compared to Image A. The paper-cut style typically leads to simpler interpretations, having fewer elements and less depth. However, there are lines and motifs suggesting subtle textures like grain or representation of aged appearance, though greatly simplified compared to the original image.",

    "Question": "Q6: Is the image mounted on a background that appears to be textured, antique-gold colored cardstock?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a distinct antique-gold color forming the background, which along with the border, gives the impression of being on a cardstock. This contrasts with the natural backgrounds and colors shown in Image A, which suggest no cardstock formatting. This texture and color contribute to the cardstock-like appearance.",
