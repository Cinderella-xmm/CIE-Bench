      "question": "Is the title \"Berry Good Breakfast Choices\" clearly visible on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the top-center of the image, the text \"Berry Good Breakfast Choices\" is prominently displayed. The use of large, bold letters makes it easily visible and recognizable as the title of the image. This observation stems from the usual layout conventions where titles are placed at the top and styled to stand out.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there additional vibrant blueberry illustrations added to the surface of the pie slice?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie slice has been augmented with additional bright and vibrant blueberry illustrations. This differs from the usual appearance of a pie slice, which typically features a more realistic representation. The distinct, vivid depiction is clearly noticeable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all illustrated blueberries labeled with specific nutritional information such as fiber, antioxidants, or vitamins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, it can be noted that there are various illustrations and texts associated with the blueberries, but none explicitly mention specific nutritional information like fiber, antioxidants, or vitamins. The accompanying text seems to be nonsensical or encoded, and does not appear to directly communicate nutritional facts.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the tea mug been transformed into a cartoon-like character with facial features and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug is redesigned with cartoonish facial features, like eyes and a smile, and has been given limbs, anthropomorphizing it into a character. This transformation is visually stark compared to a regular mug, and aligns with stylistic choices seen in cartoons where inanimate objects are given human-like traits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the anthropomorphic tea mug displaying or presenting a healthy eating tip via text or gesture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the anthropomorphic tea mug holding a string in one hand, which implies an action-oriented presentation but there isn't any text or gesture explicitly coming from the mug to indicate any healthy eating tip. The healthy eating tips appear to be listed separately in a box on the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a minimalistic chart included that displays benefits of pairing berries and tea?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are illustrations and text combinations, there is no clear chart that outlines the benefits of berries and tea pairing in a structured or minimalistic way. The text appears more decorative and less informative about specific benefits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the chart use warm pastel colors (e.g., soft orange, pink, yellow) to highlight its information?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a backdrop with warm colors, such as soft beige and other pastel shades, which are often associated with a visually appealing and soft presentation style. However, there is no structured 'chart' as conventionally defined, but the colors used do indeed fall within the warm pastel spectrum expected in such informative designs.",
