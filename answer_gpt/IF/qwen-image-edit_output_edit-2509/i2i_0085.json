    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the painting visibly extend beyond its frame to create a 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting is clearly contained within its frame, and there is no visual extension beyond the frame that would create a 3D effect. The frame has a distinct wooden border that separates the painting from the surrounding wall, and there is no indication of elements protruding out from the frame.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elements from the painting visually merge into the room environment, such as appearing on the wall or floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting remains confined within its frame, and there are no elements of the painting, such as trees or water, that appear to extend into the room's environment. The boundaries of the painting are sharply defined by the frame, preventing any visual merging with the wall or floor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transitions between the painting and the room environment smooth without any abrupt edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the painting and the room environment is not smooth due to the presence of the frame, which creates an abrupt edge. The frame acts as a clear boundary, preventing any blending of the painting's elements with the surrounding room.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original elements of the painting, such as trees, water, and the sun, still identifiable in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting retains all its original elements, including the trees, water, and the sun. These elements are clearly visible and identifiable within the frame, indicating that the edited image has not altered the content of the painting itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows in the extended portions of the painting match those in the actual room environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have any extended portions of the painting that merge with the room environment, so there are no extended elements with lighting and shadows to compare with the actual room environment. The painting remains entirely within its frame.",
