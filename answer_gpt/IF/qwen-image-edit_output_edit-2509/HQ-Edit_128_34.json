        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers are depicted inside a resin cube, making them appear like miniature models rather than life-sized structures as in Image A. The comparison indicates a deliberate reduction in size, contributing to a different perception of depth and scale.",
