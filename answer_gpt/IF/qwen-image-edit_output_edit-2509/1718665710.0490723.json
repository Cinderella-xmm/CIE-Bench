      "question": "Is the character depicted as a small, stylized chibi figure suitable for a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is portrayed in a simplified and exaggerated style common in chibi designs, with features suggesting a toy or collector-friendly format suitable for a keychain. Such designs emphasize soft and rounded proportions and appeal to chibi aesthetics. Given the overall presentation and the keychain loop, the character meets the criteria for a chibi-style keychain figure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor appears stylized with flat colors typical of toys or figures. While reflections or glossy finishes aren't distinct, the armor has a toy-like sheen, suggesting a form of gloss.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a disproportionate style commonly seen in chibi designs where the head is notably larger than the body.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a keychain loop is attached to the character's head, visibly identifiable as a functional element of a keychain. This silver chain-like loop is familiar in keychain designs for easy attachment to various items.",
