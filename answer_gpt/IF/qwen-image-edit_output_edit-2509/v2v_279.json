      "question": "Has the bird been converted into a 3D chibi-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird displays the distinct characteristics of a minimalist and rounded design typical of the 3D chibi-style models, including exaggerated features such as large eyes and a simplified form. This is contrast with Image A, where the bird is painted in a more realistic manner. Combining these visual cues with knowledge of chibi styling, it's evident that the bird has indeed been converted into a chibi-style model.",

      "question": "Has the lemur been converted into a 3D chibi-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lemur appears more rounded and feature-simplified compared to a realistic style, showing disproportionately large eyes typical of a chibi-style model. Image A features the lemur in a naturalistic painting style. Due to the noticeable shift to chibi-style attributes, the lemur has been converted into a 3D chibi-style model in Image B.",

      "question": "Have the other characters in the scene been converted into 3D chibi-style models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the charactersâ€™ appearances reflect the chibi-style model's features, including exaggerated heads, simplified body shapes, and minimal facial detail. Image A presents them in a more detailed and realistic painting style. Therefore, all characters in Image B have been converted into 3D chibi-style models.",

      "question": "Are the outfits and accessories of the characters preserved after being converted into 3D chibi-style models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters retain the same clothing styles and accessories, such as the pocket watch and the attire colors, indicating these elements are preserved. The visual comparison demonstrates consistency in the outfits and accessories between both images while adapting them to the chibi style in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A side-by-side observation reveals that both Image A and Image B have the same compositional layout. The positions of the characters, bird, and lemur align perfectly in both images, maintaining the arrangement of the scene.",
