    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a holographic projection screen added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a bright, transparent interface with digital elements overlaying the middle section of the image in front of the man's face. This resembles a holographic display, a common sci-fi representation for projecting data in mid-air. The visual elements suggest a digital screen consistent with holographic technology.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection appear to emerge from the man's phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic interface in Image B seems to be aligned above the phone he is holding, creating the illusion that the digital screen projects upwards from the device. This is a common portrayal of smartphone-integrated holographic displays in science fiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen display a city map interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The panel in Image B shows a grid-like pattern with blocks that resemble the layout of streets and buildings, commonly used in map interfaces. This visual arrangement hints at the depiction of a city map, augmented onto the screen.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the holographic projection screen designed in a futuristic and transparent style characteristic of sci-fi elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The projection in Image B appears with glowing blue digital elements overlaid in a mid-air fashion, embodying a see-through, luminous design often linked to futuristic technology in science fiction. The aesthetics align with common sci-fi tropes for holographic interfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the rest of the image consistent with the original, without additional unintended changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B introduces a holographic screen, the rest of the image, including the man holding a smartphone and the dark background, remains consistent with the typical features seen in such images. No other visual elements appear altered or out of context beyond the intended holographic addition.",
