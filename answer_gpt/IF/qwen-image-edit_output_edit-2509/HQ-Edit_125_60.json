      "question": "Has the tagine been transformed into a genie lamp shape with a bulbous body and a narrow neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a classic genie lamp, characterized by a bulbous body and a narrow neck, a common depiction in folklore and fantasy. This distinct shape is different from the traditional tagine, which is typically conical. The bulbous body and spout are indicative of the transformation into a genie lamp.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the object with a graceful spout extending from it. A spout is a common feature of genie lamps, which are designed for pouring. This differs from the top of a tagine, which is usually conical without a spout.",
