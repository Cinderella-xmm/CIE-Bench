      "question": "Has the body of each elephant been transformed into an elegant, curved bottle shape with a defined neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual analysis shows that the objects depicted are not elephants but rather two bottles with elegant, curved shapes and defined necks. This is deduced from the bottle-like appearance with a wide base and narrow neck, which is typical of perfume bottles. Therefore, the elephants have indeed been transformed into bottles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the elephant's ears now shaped like gold-trimmed caps positioned at the top of the bottle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the bottles feature shapes resembling ears with a gold trim, positioned as caps on the bottle necks. This suggests a transformation from the elephant's ears into decorative caps, retaining some design elements reminiscent of elephant ears.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants been replaced with a glass mosaic pattern composed of small reflective tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the bottles shows a glass mosaic pattern with small reflective tiles, similar to what might replace the glittering backs of the elephants if visualized as textured decoration. This suggests that the original texture has been replaced with a sophisticated mosaic design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no brand logo is placed along any trunk-like structure since the design does not include any parts resembling an elephant's trunk. Instead, the focus is on the bottle bodies, which have a brand logo centrally placed.",
