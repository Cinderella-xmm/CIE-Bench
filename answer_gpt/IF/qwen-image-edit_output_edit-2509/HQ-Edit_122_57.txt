    "Question": "Q3: Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers appear pastel-toned, translucent, and delicately carved, suggestive of crystal or glass craftsmanship. This contrasts with Image A, which features natural, colorful blooms. Thus, all the flowers have been replaced by crystal blossoms in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the vase standing on a flat surface that appears reflective but does not show a clear reflection. The surface is simple compared to the ornate table in Image A, but there is no indication of a mirrored pedestal providing a clear reflection of the items.",
