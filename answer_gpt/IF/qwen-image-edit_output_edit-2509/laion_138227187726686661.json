      "question": "Is the bedspread composed of multicolored LEGO-style blocks arranged in a patchwork pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedspread is clearly composed of a pattern resembling LEGO blocks with multiple colors, which creates a patchwork effect. The recognizable studded design used in LEGO is evident across the spread, showing varying hues commonly associated with LEGO blocks such as red, green, blue, and yellow. This indicates a deliberate design choice to mimic the appearance of LEGO, confirming the patchwork arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sports balls on the quilt represented by circular arrangements of LEGO-style tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any sports balls or circular designs on the quilt. Instead, the quilt is designed with multicolored LEGO-block-like tiles forming a simple block pattern. Unlike Image A, which contained sports-themed motifs of balls, Image B focuses only on the LEGO block aesthetic without trying to imitate or integrate ball shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the pillow been replaced with a cube-shaped object constructed from stacked LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cube is placed on the bed, constructed from colored LEGO bricks, mimicking the design of a pillow. This contrasts with Image A, where a traditional pillow is visible. The cube in Image B distinctly possesses the recognizable textured look of LEGO, forming a compact, geometric shape characteristic of stacked LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bed resting on a plain white surface with a visible LEGO baseplate texture (grid of raised studs)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bed situated on a structure resembling the flat and studded base often seen in LEGO sets, where the raised studs are visible across the white surface. Common sense indicates this surface is designed to look like a classic LEGO baseplate, aligning with the LEGO theme pervasive in the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background of the image a smooth, uninterrupted white surface with no visible walls, windows, or furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stark white background devoid of any additional objects, walls, or furniture. The uninterrupted white surface in Image B contrasts sharply with Image A, which contains visible features such as walls, a window, and furniture. The simplicity and absence of background features emphasize the focal point â€“ the LEGO-themed bed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bed frame or mattress appear to be constructed from LEGO bricks or styled to resemble LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No (unless explicitly stated; default assumption is only the baseplate is LEGO)",
      "explanation": "The bed in Image B is designed to give the impression that it is constructed entirely from LEGO-like materials. The large white platform upon which the bedspread rests is textured with the iconic LEGO stud pattern. This distinct LEGO style is uniform across the entire frame and base, indicating a deliberate resemblance to LEGO construction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any non-LEGO objects. There are no visible items like a soccer ball, lamp, or picture, unlike Image A, which featured such elements. The focus in Image B is solely on portraying a LEGO block motif without integrating real-world objects, maintaining consistency with the theme.",
