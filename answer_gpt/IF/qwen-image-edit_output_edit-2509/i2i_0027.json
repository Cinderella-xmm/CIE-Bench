      "question": "Has the dog been converted into a chibi-style blind box figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a chibi-style blind box figure, characterized by its exaggerated features, such as an enlarged head, large eyes, and a cute, stylized appearance. This is indicative of chibi-style design commonly used in figures and collectibles. This is a change from Image A, where the dog appears realistic, with normal body proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dogâ€™s body still in the prone, ball-focused pose after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has a stylized, sitting pose, typical for chibi figures, and it is sitting on a flat base. This contrasts with Image A where the dog is in a natural prone position focused on the ball. The pose change reflects a shift in style from realistic to collectible figure format.",

      "question": "Has the dog's head been enlarged slightly compared to its original size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi-style figure where the head is disproportionately large compared to the body, a classic feature of chibi designs that emphasizes cuteness. In Image A, the dog's head is proportionate to its body, indicative of a realistic style. This signifies an enlargement change from Image A to Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball placed so that it touches the dog's nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is placed directly touching, or very close to, the nose of the chibi figure, which is a common presentation style for figures to emphasize connection with an object. In Image A, while the dog's focus is on the ball, due to perspective, it isn't as close as in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base feature a relief tennis ball pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base has what appears to be an embossed or engraved design that resembles a tennis ball, which is consistent with adding thematic details to collectible bases to enhance visual appeal. There is no comparable feature in Image A since it shows a natural setting rather than a collectible format.",
