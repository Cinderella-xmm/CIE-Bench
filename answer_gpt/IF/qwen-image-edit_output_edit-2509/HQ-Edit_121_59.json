    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly four separate images or prints shown, each featuring the fisherman?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it is apparent that there are four distinct images of the fisherman, each bordered by a wooden frame. The frames are consistent in appearance, suggesting that these are indeed intended to be four separate images or prints, not one continuous image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the fisherman exhibit exaggerated proportions, simplified facial features, and bold outlines characteristic of semi-cartoon art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fisherman appears to have realistic proportions and details, with natural textures in his clothing and environment. The overall style is more aligned with realism than a semi-cartoon art style characterized by exaggerated features and bold outlines.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing the two images, the textures of the fisherman's hat and plaid shirt in Image B do not seem visibly more detailed or pronounced than in Image A. Both images appear to maintain a consistent level of detail in the portrayal of textures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fishing rod held by the fisherman in Image A has been replaced with a golden-colored object that resembles a magical staff, deviating from the typical appearance of a fishing rod.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed ornamental swirling ripples on the surface of the water beneath the fisherman's reflection. These elements give an impression of magical effects as they are not present in a typical water reflection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
