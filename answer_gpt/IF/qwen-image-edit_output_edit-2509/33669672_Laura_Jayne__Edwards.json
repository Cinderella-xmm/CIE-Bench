    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered as a bronze sculpture with a metallic surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to have a consistent color associated with bronze sculptures, and the surface reflects light like metal, indicating it is meant to look bronze and metallic. The overall reduction of varied colors to a cohesive metallic tone suggests a sculpture-like finish.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs visibly elongated compared to natural human proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B presents limbs that are disproportionately long when compared to average human anatomy. This stylization might be intentional, reflecting art styles that emphasize elongated forms to convey elegance or movement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the legs form smooth, curved shapes that suggest dynamic movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure with legs that create visually smooth and curving lines, evoking a sense of motion and elegance typical of dynamic poses seen in statues or artistic renderings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all floral elements been replaced with geometric patterns consistent with Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits geometric patterns around the figure, remniscent of Art Deco with its symmetrical, angular, and repetitive motifs replacing any previously seen floral elements seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rendered in metallic tones while preserving the original color scheme (teal, red, pink)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is flattened to a bronze-like metallic tone, which shifts away from the original distinct colors seen in Image A. The metallic rendering does not maintain teal, red, or pink hues as distinct elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background a solid, uniform turquoise color matching the overall aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images present the same turquoise background, which remains consistent and uniform throughout Image B. This backdrop complements the bronze figure standing in contrast against it, aligning with the aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the adornments on the figure composed of symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typical of Art Deco style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The adornments surrounding the figure in Image B depict geometric patterns characterized by symmetry and angular repetition, elements typical of Art Deco style, replacing any organic forms initially present.",
