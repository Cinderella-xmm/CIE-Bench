      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a yellow substance that resembles melted cheese is visible on top of the hot dogs. The smooth and creamy texture of this topping is consistent with how melted cheese appears. Typically, cheese on hot dogs melts in a uniform layer, as is seen here. There is no such substance atop the hot dogs in Image A. Therefore, the visual cues in Image B indicate that melted cheese has indeed been added.",

      "question": "Have fried onions been added on top of the hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows thin, brownish strips layered on top of the hot dogs. The color and curled appearance can be attributed to fried onions, which are often used to garnish grilled foods like hot dogs. In Image A, there are no such strips visible; hence, based on visual examination and what fried onions typically look like, Image B does have fried onions added on top.",

      "question": "Is there a barbecue tong added near the grill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a metallic object with gripper ends positioned above the hot dogs, suggesting the presence of a barbecue tong. This tool is commonly used in grilling to manage and rotate food items. Image A lacks this element, indicating the addition of the tong in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the hot dog buns and sausages still visible and identifiable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of toppings like melted cheese and fried onions, the fundamental components of a hot dog—the bun and sausage—are still discernible. The sausages maintain their noticeable shape and position within the bun. Image A similarly displays these elements clearly, reaffirming their visibility and identifiability.",

      "question": "Are the flames and grill visible beneath the hot dogs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to show the grill grates and the orange glow of flames underneath the hot dogs. These are key indicators of grilling activity, and both elements are prominently visible in Image A as well. Thus, the flames and grill remain visible even after the additions in Image B.",
