        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure enclosing the figures resembles a grotto made from a stone material that has a polished, marble-like texture. This is a change from Image A, where the structure was clearly wooden.

Architectural features such as columns further indicate this is a different and more refined setting compared to a simple wooden structure.",
