        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box housing the collectible figure shows signs of isometric projection.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the motorcycle with glowing neon elements around the wheels and other parts of the body, which are common features of futuristic or stylized models. The presence of hover-like structures in place of traditional wheels corroborates the idea that it has hover capabilities. The design's emphasis on technological aesthetics implies a digital interface presence, although not directly visible.",
