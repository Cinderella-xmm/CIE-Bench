      "question": "Is the grand piano replaced with a cookie sculpture that retains the same overall shape and structure as the original piano?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object at the center visually resembles a piano in terms of shape and structure, including features like the keyboard and the grand piano's characteristic lid. Furthermore, the item is clearly crafted to mimic a piano but constructed from what appears to be cookie material. Comparing this with Image A, which features a traditional grand piano, confirms the replacement while maintaining the overall form and style typical of grand pianos.",

      "question": "Is the surface of the piano sculpture uniformly colored in a rich caramel hue instead of glossy black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie piano displays a distinctive coloring consistent with baked goods, particularly resembling a rich caramel tone due to its brownish-orange hue. This contrasts with Image A, where the piano's surface exhibits the deep glossy black finish expected from a typical grand piano. Thus, the edited image uses this specific color to convey its cookie material.",

      "question": "Are there visible white and gold icing designs on the cookie piano that replicate the ornate details of the original piano?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cookie piano adorned with icing designs that are intricately detailed, incorporating patterns and textures commonly seen in cookie decoration. These designs bear a resemblance to but do not exactly replicate the ornate gold detailing seen in Image A, which relies on actual material ornamentation. Therefore, while similar in decorative intent, the specific replication isn't precise, focusing more on decorative artistry suitable for a cookie rather than authentic replication.",

      "question": "Are the piano keys made of embedded sugar crystals rather than solid black or white material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Close examination of Image B reveals piano keys crafted to appear raised, likely intended as sugar decorations, distinctive in appearance from traditional solid keys. Unlike Image A, where keys are seen in conventional black and white contrast, the appearance of Image B emphasizes decorative elements suitable for cookie art, like sugar crystals. This implies production choices that depart from traditional materials.",

      "question": "Is the cookie piano positioned on a plain white marble tabletop, devoid of any surrounding stage, audience, or theater elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cookie piano atop a white marble-like surface, with a shifted scene background resulting in the removal of visible theater elements such as seating or stage architecture seen in Image A. Instead, the focus is solely on the piano, disregarding surrounding context found in the original theatrical setting.",
