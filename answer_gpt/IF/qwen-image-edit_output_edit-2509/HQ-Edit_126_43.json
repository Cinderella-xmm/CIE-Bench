    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the antique clock been transformed into a sentient, mechanical creature resembling a steampunk sentinel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has been transformed significantly. It now features a singular eye, gears as part of its structure, armored appendages, and a tail, which are not typical features of a classic clock. These elements collectively give it an anthropomorphic and mechanical appearance, akin to steampunk aesthetics, suggesting a transformation into a sentient, mechanical creature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there gear-based limb-like appendages extending from the clock’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows robotic or mechanical limbs extending from the main body of the structure, which are built using gears and metallic parts. These resemble appendages and are gear-based, making it distinct from a standard clock structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has one of the clock faces been replaced with a monocled eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traditional clock face is significantly altered to feature a large, singular eye, replacing a portion typically occupied by clock dials. This eye is a key feature that contrasts with traditional clock design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the pendulum been transformed into a swinging tail-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does feature a tail-like structure, it is not a swinging pendulum. The pendulum of the original clock does not seem to be directly transformed into this tail, suggesting that while tail-like structures exist, they are not derived from the pendulum.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature’s body feature brass and copper-colored metallic surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) is predominantly colored in brass and copper tones, which are characteristic of steampunk aesthetics. These metallic surfaces are present throughout the body of the creature, adding to the steampunk theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there steam valves visibly protruding from the corners or joints of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are parts of the structure where steam appears to be emanating from valve-like structures, particularly at the joints and corners of the mechanical limbs and body. This usage of steam is a classic feature of steampunk design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate engravings or decorative patterns along the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the creature in Image B features complex and decorative patterns and engravings typical of intricate industrial design, especially accentuating the metallic surfaces and enhancing the steampunk style.",
