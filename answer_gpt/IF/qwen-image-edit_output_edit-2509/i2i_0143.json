      "question": "Is the parking meter still in the foreground, maintaining its original position relative to the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter is positioned prominently in the foreground, similar to Image A. The visual perspective and placement indicate that the meter remains in its original position relative to the viewer despite the change in background. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent foreground presence in both images, suggesting the meter's unchanged relative positioning.",

      "question": "Are there visible effects of heat haze, such as blurring and shimmering around the parking meter and the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background road and surrounding desert landscape exhibit a slight blurring effect that is indicative of heat haze, commonly observed in arid environments. This visual cue suggests the presence of heat haze effects, which are known for causing distortion and shimmer in hot conditions.",

      "question": "Is the parking meter standing alone without any nearby objects or irrelevant elements in the new desert highway setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter is shown standing alone in the desert highway setting. There are no visible people, cars, or urban elements that were present in Image A. This isolated placement in the desert terrain indicates the absence of nearby objects or elements, aligning with the solitary depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the desert highway include sand and sparse vegetation in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features typical desert characteristics, namely sand and sparse vegetation along the highway. This visual information aligns with the description of a desert setting, where minimal plant life is spread across sandy terrain. The absence of dense vegetation further supports this conclusion.",
