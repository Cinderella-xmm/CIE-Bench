    "Question": "Q1: Do the bottle, opener, and glass appear to be modeled out of textured clay?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle, opener, and glass all exhibit a consistent, matte surface texture typical of clay sculptures or models. They lack the reflective quality and transparency seen in glass or metal, suggesting a ceramic or clay material. This conclusion is drawn from the typical characteristics of clay objects, which include a dull finish and roughly textured surface.",
