      "question": "Is the eagle enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the eagle is indeed enclosed within a transparent dome. This observation is based on the visual cues such as the reflective surface and contours of a dome-like structure around the eagle. The dome shape suggests that it is meant to protect or display the eagle figure within, which aligns with world knowledge about display cases or notifications often having transparent coverings.",

      "question": "Does the eagle appear as a 3D stylized sculpture with sculptural features (e.g., defined form, modeling lines, or material texture)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eagle in Image B appears to be a 3D stylized sculpture. This conclusion comes from its defined form and modeling lines, which indicate it is crafted rather than a real bird. Sculptures often have distinct characteristics such as material texture and modeling, evidenced by the smooth surface and uniform features displayed in the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed miniature swirling clouds located directly under the eagle's wings. The visual shows cloud-like forms ascending from the base of the sculpture, surrounding the underside of the eagle, suggesting stylized cloud formations used in artistic renditions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature clouds under the eagle’s wings in Image B are adorned with visible gold leaf accents.
