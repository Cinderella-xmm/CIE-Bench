        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a Victorian attire modified with cosmic dust or celestial elements, creating an illusion that the attire is merging with the cosmos. The clothing is adorned with numerous clocks and ethereal, swirling patterns that evoke a sense of the fabric being integrated with cosmic dust. This visual integration suggests that the attire is partially dissolved into the cosmic background.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass scientific instrument is depicted with intricate tendrils extending from it. These tendrils bear a resemblance to clockwork or mechanical elements, curling around the instrument. This suggests a connection to elaborate, clockwork machinery, indicating complexity and elegance mirroring surrealistic artwork.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual details in Image B show the clockwork tendrils extending outward near the monkey's hands, suggesting a gentle interaction. The hands appear slightly distorted or elongated in relation to the tendrils, adding to the surreal nature. This relation implies a subtle, delicate grasp between the tendrils and hands, enhancing the whimsical essence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines elements of Victorian attire, cosmic backgrounds, and merging of biological and mechanical forms to evoke a surreal atmosphere. The presence of cosmic dust, clocks, and dreamlike integration of elements conjures a sense of otherworldliness and fantasy, which is a hallmark of Surrealism. The overall composition suggests a blend of reality and dream, characteristic of surreal art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the monkey is positioned similarly with a scientific instrument placed in front. Although additional surreal elements and adornments are incorporated in Image B, the fundamental arrangement of the monkey sitting at the table with the instrument has been preserved. This consistency maintains the core composition and positioning while enhancing the image with new details.",
