      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot surface exhibit a hard, reflective, non-leather-like finish consistent with metal or polished stone, indicating a sculptural material change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B has a surface that appears hard and reflective, similar to metal or polished stone. This finish suggests a deviation from traditional soft leather, indicating a material change more typical of a sculptural piece. The surface lacks the texture and pliability of leather, further supporting a transformation into a different material.",
