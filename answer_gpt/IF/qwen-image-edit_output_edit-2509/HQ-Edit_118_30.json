      "question": "Are the train cars depicted as large, colorful, interlocking blocks rather than realistic carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train cars are depicted within a puzzle, maintaining their form and structure. The vibrant colors enhance their appearance, but they remain realistic along with the rest of the scene. The train cars appear to be normal representations rather than interlocking blocks, aligning with realistic carriage design. Image A also depicts the train cars as realistic, maintaining their traditional design. The comparison further confirms that both images feature realistic carriages, not block-like structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the train rendered as swirling white forms instead of a realistic cloud of steam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke emanating from the train is depicted as a swirling white form. This is consistent in the puzzle format, where artistic style allows for interpretation beyond realism. The simplified representation lends itself to artistic design. Image A presents the train smoke with more detail and texture, closely resembling realistic steam. Comparing both reveals that Image B conveys the swirling depiction more than realistic steam.",

      "question": "Has the countryside landscape been converted into various geometric patterns such as grids, polygons, or angular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the countryside landscape with an assortment of geometric patterns, clearly visible through the fields and hills. The design includes distinct sections and shapes, exhibiting artistic creativity. Image A does not portray geometric patterns; its fields appear more natural and less segmented. The comparison highlights that Image B contains geometric patterns not found in Image A.",

      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with small puzzle pieces showing individuals in vintage clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains human figures within the puzzle format, dressed in vintage clothing. They are not replaced by singular puzzle pieces, but are integrated into the puzzle design as part of the larger scene. Image A also features human figures in vintage fashion, confirming that neither image replaces figures with puzzle pieces.",

      "question": "Is the entire puzzle scene placed on a light-colored wooden tabletop with visible grain and edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the entire scene as a puzzle laid on a light-colored wooden tabletop. The visible wood grain and edges clarify the support beneath the puzzle. Image A lacks this presentation altogether, focusing on the vivid landscape and train without additional base material. Comparing the images indicates that only Image B features the tabletop.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays visible puzzle-piece lines throughout, indicating an assembled structure consistent with the characteristics of a puzzle. Lines and seams appear as interlocking edges distinctly marking each piece. Image A does not contain any puzzle-piece borders, focusing instead on a coherent illustration of the scene. Comparison shows that Image B distinctly features puzzle detailing.",
