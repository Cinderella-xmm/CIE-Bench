      "question": "Is the original scanner completely replaced by a box-shaped packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary object is a box-shaped design that features an image of a scanner on its surface. It appears that the physical object from Image A (the scanner) has been visually represented in a printed design on a box, indicating that the box replaces the original scanner device in terms of being a visual subject.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the box with colors that appear to shift between different hues, such as purples, blues, and greens, suggesting an iridescent effect as the lighting and angle appears to influence the color perception.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging has a printed design that looks like a stylized or digital representation of a scanner in operation rather than an actual holographic display. It's more of a graphic design element than a true holographic feature.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a design with visible grid lines and circuit-like patterns, which are typically associated with data flow and convey a tech-inspired visual appearance on the packaging.",
