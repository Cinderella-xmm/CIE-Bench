      "question": "Is the bow depicted as a folded origami paper design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow appears to have sharper edges and lacks the smooth curvature typical of an actual wooden bow. The angular lines and uniformity of the bowâ€™s structure suggest a design akin to origami, where paper is folded to create distinct shapes. The visual cues such as flat surfaces and lack of textural detail lead to the conclusion of an origami paper design.",

      "question": "Are the arrows in the quiver depicted as folded origami paper designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrows in Image B have consistent and uniform textures and shapes that suggest they are designed to resemble folded origami paper. The fletchings have precise angular patterns and the lack of material texture such as feather striations indicates an origami representation.",

      "question": "Does the woodland backdrop retain its natural appearance without any artificial alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B showcases a dense forest scene with realistic colors, light, and depth typical of a natural setting. There are no apparent artificial alterations or digital enhancements evident that would make the setting look unnatural.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and positioning of the bow and quiver remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the bow and quiver are positioned similarly in terms of their placement within the frame and relative to one another. The orientation and spacing in relation to the forest background are consistent, indicating no change in composition and positioning.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bow and quiver show clear paper folds and lack realistic material textures such as wood or leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of both the bow and quiver lack the rich texture and grain of wood or leather, showing instead a smoother, uniform surface indicative of paper. The bow, in particular, exhibits angular lines and edges typical of origami folds, emphasizing a crafted rather than a naturally textured appearance.",
