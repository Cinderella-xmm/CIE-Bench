      "question": "Does the image exhibit flat color fields, bold outlines, and minimal shading consistent with traditional Japanese woodblock prints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style is illustrative with flat color usage and strong, bold outlines, reminiscent of traditional Japanese woodblock prints. These prints are characterized by their use of flat planes of color and defined outlines, rather than detailed shading or gradients. Image B clearly follows this style with its defined and simplified color blocks and strong outlines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figureâ€™s facial expression calm and composed, with eyes slightly closed or downcast, indicating serene contemplation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B is blurred, and therefore specifically analyzing the facial expression for signs of calmness or contemplation is not possible. However, the general posture and setting in woodblock prints often exhibit calm and serene themes, suggesting that if the face were visible, it would likely align with that.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono is depicted with intricate, colorful patterns, displaying a variety of vibrant and saturated colors.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the cherry blossoms and bridge in a stylized manner typical of Japanese woodblock prints.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows characteristics of a textured, matte surface similar to aged paper texture, common in traditional woodblock prints. The absence of any glossy or reflective regions further supports this observation, aligning with the typical aesthetic of these prints.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
