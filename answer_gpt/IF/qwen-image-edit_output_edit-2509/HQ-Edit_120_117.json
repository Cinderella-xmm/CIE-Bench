      "question": "Is the entire lighthouse scene enclosed within a spherical glass or transparent globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse scene is clearly depicted as being within a spherical glass object, resembling a snow globe. The hallmark characteristic of a snow globe is the spherical enclosure, typically glass or transparent material, encapsulating a scene inside it. By observing Image B, it is evident that the lighthouse along with the surrounding landscape is inside such a spherical glass structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lighthouse inside the globe depicted as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the contrast between the large globe size and the small lighthouse scene inside, the lighthouse appears to be a miniature 3D model, emphasizing a reduced scale as compared to a real-world structure. Within the context of a globe, items are often miniaturized to fit inside, aligning with common design choices for objects like snow globes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves around the lighthouse inside the globe made of translucent blue resin with a stylized appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surrounding the lighthouse has a shiny and semi-transparent quality, with stylized waves that appear smooth and continuous. This mimics the appearance of translucent blue resin, which is often used in models to depict water due to its ability to hold folds and curves artistically while allowing light to pass through slightly, creating a stylized and aesthetic wave effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the globe rest on a wooden base with an engraved compass rose pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The globe in Image B is positioned on a wooden base that features a clear design of a compass rose pattern. The compass rose is a traditional navigational emblem typically carved or engraved on wooden surfaces for decorative purposes. By observing the wooden base, it is apparent that such a pattern is present, showing typical craftsmanship seen in ornamental globes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are painted clouds and a distant mountain panorama visible in the background behind the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is simplified to a uniform gradient, without visible details of clouds or a distant mountain panorama. The focus is entirely on the globe itself centered against a plain backdrop. Therefore, there are no clouds or mountain panoramas visible outside or behind the spherical globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the rocks inside the globe rendered in earthy tones (such as browns, tans, and greens) and the water in vibrant shades of blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the globe in Image B, the rocks are depicted using earthy colors like browns and tans with some green, reflecting natural tones. The water is shown in vibrant shades of blue, illustrating a contrast often used to differentiate land from water in artistic renderings. Observing the scene within the globe reveals this deliberate choice of color palette, maintaining realistic visual cues seen in miniature landscapes.",
