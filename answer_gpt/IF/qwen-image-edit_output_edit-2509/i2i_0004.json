    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the head been slightly enlarged compared to the original body proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions reveal that the head is larger compared to the body, which is a common stylistic choice for cartoon or chibi figures to emphasize the facial area. This analysis is based on the exaggerated size and the overall cartoon-like appearance of the edited image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the body been cartoonified with flattened colors and simple shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a body with simplified forms and flat colors, typical of cartoon rendering. The limbs and attire are depicted with minimal detail, focusing on broad shapes and reduced complexity, which indicates cartoonification.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the edited subject placed against a background resembling a bookshelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B clearly shows books and shelves, suggesting a library or office setting. The presence of books in a repetitive, structured manner is consistent with bookshelf imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the eyes, smile, and proportions accurately maintained after enlarging the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given the methods of image alteration in Image B, the enlarged head belonging to a cartoon-like figure typically does not maintain realistic facial details. Therefore, detailed facial features are often simplified or absent, which is consistent with cartoon-style enlargements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cartoonified body appear separate from and non-intrusive to the realistic face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of Image B, the cartoonified body appears distinct and non-intrusive due to its simplistic style. The body doesn't overshadow the facial area introduced by the enlarged head, maintaining a visually balanced separation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
