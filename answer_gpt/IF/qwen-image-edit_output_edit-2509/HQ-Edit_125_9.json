      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features text aligned at the top and bottom, with a central graphic depicting a boy playing soccer.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
