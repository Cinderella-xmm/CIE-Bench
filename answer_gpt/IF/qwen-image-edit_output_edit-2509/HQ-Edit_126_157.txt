    "Question": "Q2: Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a scene where elements such as the boat, water, and hills appear to be cutout aspects layered on top of each other. The look of these elements suggests a composite image rather than a seamless photograph due to their 3D-like appearance, which is distinct from a flat photograph.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the boat exhibits wood textures characteristic of aged and weathered material. Details like grain patterns and surface imperfections are visible, which give the appearance of realism despite being part of a framed and layered scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
    "explanation": "The hills in Image B are depicted in pastel blue gradients, creating a softer and more stylized appearance. These hues replace realistic shades of green or gray, contributing to the artistic and cutout style of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, above the water's surface, there are distinct droplet-like etchings suggestive of ripples. These are visible and appear as decoration or detail work on a transparent layer, enhancing the artistic style of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
    "explanation": "Image B distinctly separates the elements into layers: the boat in the foreground, water in the midground, and hills in the background. This separation creates depth and a three-dimensional effect, which favors the layered cutout appearance over a standard photograph.",
    "answer": "Yes"
