        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see a human model walking down a runway holding a handbag. This suggests that the handbag has not been transformed into a human-like model.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B is adorned with gold jewelry, including earrings, a necklace, and a bracelet.
