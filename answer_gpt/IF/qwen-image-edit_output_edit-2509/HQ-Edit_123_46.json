      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the basketball player depicted in a mid-dribble pose with the ball near the ground and body in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player is shown holding the basketball close to his body, which is characteristic of someone dribbling or preparing to shoot. The pose suggests motion, possibly a dribble, although the ball is not near the ground. This indicates a dynamic action rather than a static moment. Considering these visual clues and the nature of basketball movement, it's reasonable to determine that the player is depicted in active motion.",
