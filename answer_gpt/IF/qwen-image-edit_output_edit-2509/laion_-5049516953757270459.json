    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire heart-shaped board composed solely of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire heart-shaped board is not made entirely of LEGO bricks. The image shows a design that incorporates both realistic-looking produce and some LEGO bricks surrounding them. Thus, although LEGO elements are present, the whole board is not solely composed of LEGO bricks forming a mosaic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used to represent the food items colored appropriately to match the original produce (e.g., blue for blueberries, red for tomatoes)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the LEGO bricks that are visible are multicolored and form a border around the real produce but do not attempt to replicate the colors of the food items. The LEGO bricks are colorful but do not mimic or represent the produce colors specifically, hence they do not exactly match the original produce colors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are different LEGO brick sizes and shapes used to simulate textures (e.g., smooth bricks for avocado, small round bricks for berries, larger chunky bricks for broccoli)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks primarily form an edge around the food items without simulating the textures of the individual produce items. The bricks don't appear to vary in size and shape significantly to mimic the texture of food items, like smoothness or chunkiness, as they primarily form the base and border.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all food items in the LEGO mosaic have clearly defined and distinct borders separating them from adjacent items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the food items are arranged on what seems like a platform created by LEGO bricks, but the bricks do not create borders that define each food item separately from the others. The bricks form a general border around the collective arrangement of food items rather than individual separations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the LEGO mosaic remain a perfect heart, matching the original boardâ€™s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO mosaic maintains the heart shape, similar to the original board's silhouette, as the shape observed from the configuration of the bricks and the placement of the food items forms a heart. It closely resembles the heart shape from Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the LEGO mosaic placed on a solid, neutral gray base with no visible texture or pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals that the LEGO mosaic is indeed placed on a solid, neutral gray base. The base is comprised of classic LEGO base plates, which are typically gray and present a uniform appearance without additional texture or pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the LEGO mosaic exhibit a clear pixelated, blocky appearance consistent with a LEGO construction, rather than a smooth or realistic rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO mosaic in Image B exhibits the quintessential blocky and pixelated appearance characteristic of LEGO structures. Individual LEGO studs are visible, and the construction method does not smooth out or attempt to mimic a realistic rendering, consistently showcasing the blocky style typical of LEGO construction.",
