      "question": "Is the entire forest lake scene enclosed within a visible spherical glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene, including the landscape and the figures within, is captured inside a transparent spherical structure that resembles a glass orb. This is evidenced by the curvature of the surrounding glass and the reflection patterns seen around the perimeter, which are characteristic of a spherical shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the ducks been replaced with 3D models that have a glossy, reflective surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks appear to have a glossy, shiny surface, indicative of 3D models with reflective finishes. This is apparent from the way light reflects off their surfaces, suggesting a smooth and polished texture unlike natural ducks, which typically have matte feathers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water feature layered resin-like textures and transparent materials that enhance depth and clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water in the orb shows variations in transparency and depth, akin to resin layers, which create a 3D effect and provide clarity, enhancing the perception of depth. This is signified by the gradation of light and visibility through the water layers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible miniature figurines of woodland animals placed among the rocks and vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, closer examination reveals small figurines, such as the presence of a small rabbit figure among the rocks, which aren't seen in Image A. These figurines stand out as distinct objects among the more natural setting of the landscape scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass orb resting on a natural wood base with visible organic textures such as grain or bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base on which the glass orb is resting in Image B is made of a natural wood material, as shown by the visible grain and bark textures. These organic textures are common indicators of real wood and contrast with the synthetic appearance of other materials in the scene.",
