    "Question": "Q1: Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the tiger figure is depicted with crisp, defined edges and lacks the complex shading that would give it a realistic three-dimensional appearance. This style is reminiscent of cut-paper art, where shapes are distinctly separated and the overall look is flat rather than volumetric. This depiction is indicative of the cut-paper style, characterized by clear lines and lack of gradient shading that mimics real lighting and shadows.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tiger's stripes visibly wider and more stylized than natural tiger markings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's stripes are stylized to be bolder and more uniform compared to natural tiger markings, which typically vary more in width and curvature. This stylization decision aligns with artistic choices that emphasize graphic elements over realism, making the stripes appear more pronounced and designed for visual impact rather than accurate representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the tiger's whiskers noticeably longer and thicker than natural proportions?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the whiskers on the tiger mask appear to be longer and thicker than what is typical for a real tiger. In natural settings, tiger whiskers are substantial but not excessively exaggerated. Here, their exaggerated length and thickness are likely intentional, aligning with the stylized aesthetic of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the kimono appear as if composed of multiple overlapping paper layers with distinct edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono appears to be depicted with clear lines and edges, suggesting a layered effect typical of paper collages. The distinct edges characteristic of cut paper reinforce the perception of multiple overlapping layers, each with a definite boundary, enhancing the visual depth despite the flat rendering style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there shiny, metallic gold accents on the cherry blossom patterns of the kimono?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the kimono with cherry blossom patterns that include metallic-looking gold accents. These accents appear shiny and distinct from the rest of the pattern, mimicking the look of metallic foils or inks often used in decorative arts to add visual richness and luxe details to flat designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there visible perforations, tabs, or fold lines indicating detachable sections of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges and some parts of the image have components that resemble perforations or lines that might suggest tabs or sections designed to be detachable. This suggests a construction that allows for physical manipulation, such as detachment or reconfiguration, typical in papercraft or pop-up art styles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there visible fold lines or structural elements suggesting the image can be physically folded or interacted with?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains lines and structural suggestions that indicate the potential for physical interaction, such as folding or unfolding. These structural elements, while visually part of the flat image, imply a design akin to crafted artworks that can be manipulated in the physical space, encouraging interactivity beyond just visual appreciation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
