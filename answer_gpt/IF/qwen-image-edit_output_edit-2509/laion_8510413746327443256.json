      "question": "Does the edited image show the smartwatch transformed into a full cybernetic wrist dragon with dragon-like anatomy integrated into the wrist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smartwatch heavily edited with some fantastical elements, including the appearance of digital and cybernetic decorations. However, it does not fully transform into a cybernetic wrist dragon but retains the basic structure and form of a smartwatch with a highly detailed and stylized band and face. The watch now includes dragon-like design elements, such as a spiny band and mystical symbols. Despite these elements, it does not transform into a dragon with anatomy such as wings, a head, or a body.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the watch face replaced with a radiant, multi-layered holographic dragon eye featuring glowing elements and depth effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch face is distinctly altered to display a luminescent eye-like structure with intricate detailing and depth. The bright blue colors and radiating lines resemble a sci-fi or fantasy thematic eye rather than the traditional clock face seen in smartwatches. This design gives the impression of a holographic projection with glowing effects.",

      "question": "Are the original silicone band and its contours replaced with a series of interlocking, metallic silver scales that cover the wrist portion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The band in Image B is transformed from its original silicone material into a design that resembles interlocking metallic scales. This new structure covers the wrist portion and gives a metallic and mechanical appearance, in contrast to the flexible and smooth characteristic of the original silicone band seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the digital crown been replaced with a glowing, spherical neural node emitting light or energy pulses, resembling a biotech interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital crown of the smartwatch appears altered with additional glowing effects and a cybernetic design. However, it maintains its physical form as a crown-like structure rather than a spherical neural node. While the design is enhanced to look technological and futuristic, it does not fully resemble a singular spherical node as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original app icons on the watch face replaced with glowing, rune-like control sigils that emit light and reflect a tech-magic aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watch face in Image B lacks the conventional app icons found in Image A. Instead, it features a mystical, eye-like graphic with runic symbols that emit a glowing, magical aesthetic. This thematic shift reflects a combination of technology and mysticism, replacing the practical utility of app icons with decorative, glowing elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image display a dynamic form with visual cues such as energy flow, motion lines, or an active posture that conveys movement and life?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B incorporates many elements that suggest dynamism, such as the glowing effects and energetic design patterns on the watch face and the band. However, it does not incorporate explicit motion cues, such as motion lines or an active movement posture. It remains a static image with enhanced visual themes but lacks clear indicators of motion or life.",
