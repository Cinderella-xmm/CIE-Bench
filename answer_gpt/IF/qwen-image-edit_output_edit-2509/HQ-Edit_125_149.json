      "question": "Is the bridge transformed into a creature resembling an ancient forest guardian, with organic features replacing mechanical ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure previously identified as a bridge in Image A now appears as an enormous, tree-like creature. It has distinct organic features such as wood, vines, and foliage that are typically associated with a forest setting. The mechanical aspects such as metal and geometric shapes that constituted the bridge are replaced by these natural elements, supporting the notion that the structure is now a creature resembling an ancient forest guardian.",

      "question": "Are the bridge towers transformed into wooden limbs covered in foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the previously vertical and rigid lines of the bridge towers in Image A have been replaced by what appear to be tree trunks or limbs. These limbs are wrapped in vine-like structures and covered with foliage, helping to further convey a transition from mechanical to an organic form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bridge arches reshaped into a ribcage-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archetypal vertical and horizontal structures of the bridge no longer exist in a traditional format. Instead, the central part of the creature, particularly the area below its head, presents a structure resembling a ribcage due to the curved, branch-like lines mimicking ribs. This signifies a morphing from bridge arches to a skeletal form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bridge cables replaced with vine-like tendrils that support the creature’s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of the metal cables seen in Image A, there are vine-like tendrils that appear to provide support to the creature’s body. These natural tendrils further enhance the transformation from a man-made bridge to a living creature constituting organic matter.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone bases replaced with moss-covered roots extending into the flowing stream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anchor points of the bridge in Image A, presumably made of stone or concrete, are replaced with a network of roots that delve into the stream. These roots are also moss-covered, emphasizing the natural transformation, contrary to the inorganic base seen before.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the creature have a head made of bark texture with glowing emerald eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the upper part of the creature, a head can be observed with features that resemble bark texture. The eyes are notable for their bright, glowing emerald color, a characteristic not discernible in any form in the original bridge's structure but synonymous with portraying an animated and mystical entity.",
