      "question": "Is the perfume bottle constructed entirely out of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle retains a highly detailed and intricate design, with a crystal-like appearance that is not typical of Lego bricks. Lego bricks are usually blocky and lack the transparency and fine detailing present in the bottle seen in Image B. This suggests that the bottle itself is not made out of Lego bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the fabric background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a mosaic-like pattern with distinct square shapes and solid colors, resembling Lego bricks. This starkly contrasts with the smooth, flowing fabric seen in Image A, indicating that the background in Image B is indeed recreated using Lego bricks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and positioning of the perfume bottle and fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the perfume bottle maintains its position and orientation in Image B as in Image A, the fabric background is replaced with a Lego brick background. Therefore, while the bottle's composition and positioning relative to the camera remain the same, the background context has changed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the perfume bottle, including the cap and spray mechanism, accurately represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle retains detailed elements like the faceted cap and the spray mechanism that are not consistent with Lego's blocky nature. The intricate detailing suggests the bottle itself is not constructed from Lego bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stop-motion diorama style consistently applied to both the perfume bottle and the fabric background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and base appear to be composed of Lego bricks, creating a stop-motion diorama effect. However, the bottle retains a realistic appearance and does not conform to the Lego brick diorama style. Thus, the style is not consistently applied across both elements.",
