      "question": "Is the clock's frame made of translucent crystal instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock's frame has a shiny and reflective surface, commonly attributed to materials like crystal or glass. Typically, wood appears more textured with a more matte finish. The color of the frame in Image B is white, which is more fitting for materials like crystal. In Image A, the frame is wooden with a carved texture. Comparing both images, Image B features a frame of likely crystalline material, while Image A showcases a wooden frame. Visual cues like color, texture, and reflectivity were used to make this distinction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ornamental details and frame of the clock crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornamental details in Image B appear shiny and white, suggesting they are made of crystal. Typically, frosted crystal presents a diffuse light reflection making it appear foggy or matte, unlike wood, which has an organic texture and is often darker in hue. Image A has ornamental details carved in wood, showcasing a warm, brown tone with visible grain texture. In comparison, Image B's details are likely crafted from frosted crystal, deduced from the apparent material quality and visual characteristics.",

      "question": "Is the clock face made of smooth, clear crystal with etched Roman numerals instead of a wooden face with painted numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth, shiny face typically seen in materials like crystal or glass, where the numerals appear etched or engraved into the surface, creating a sophisticated appearance. Image A has a wooden face with printed Roman numerals, exhibiting a textured surface with painted numerals. Upon comparison, Image B indeed features a clock face made of a smooth, clear material like crystal with etched numerals.",

      "question": "Has the pendulum been replaced with a faceted crystal ornament instead of a solid wooden disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pendulum in Image B is distinctly a faceted crystal ornament, reflecting light and showing highly refractive qualities common in cut crystal. In Image A, the pendulum is a wooden disc, showcasing a solid and warm texture. Comparing these two elements supports that Image B's pendulum has been replaced with a crystal ornament, characterized by its light play and geometric facets.",

      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a minimalist white marble wall with visible natural veining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a background that resembles white marble, evident by the smooth texture and natural veining pattern. These visual cues, paired with world knowledge about marble characteristics, affirm this is a marble wall. Image A, on the other hand, has a more rustic, textured wall. Thus, the comparison reveals Image B's setting is indeed a minimalist marble wall.",
