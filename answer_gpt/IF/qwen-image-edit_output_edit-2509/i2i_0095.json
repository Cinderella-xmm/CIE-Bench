      "question": "Has the word “Shine” been added to the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror displays the word 'Shine,' indicating it has been added. This word is likely a digital addition due to its perfect placement and lighting effects. The presence of this word isn't noted in Image A, where the mirror shows no such text. Thus, the word 'Shine' is an added element in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' is placed symmetrically within the mirror, equidistant from the sides and appears directly above the sink's center, aligning with the overall symmetry and central axis of the bathroom design, suggesting a deliberate central positioning.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' in Image B exhibits a glowing effect, likely designed digitally to resemble neon or LED lights. This is evident from the bright aura surrounding the word, simulating a backlit glow, which is not present in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' in Image B uses a sleek, cursive font that complements the minimalistic design style. The warm, glowing color ties in with the subtle tones and lighting present in the modern bathroom, enhancing its style without overpowering it.",

      "explanation": "Adding 'Shine' in Image B maintains the bathroom's aesthetic balance through its size, central placement, and soft glow, which complements the minimalistic elements such as the mirror frame and sink design. The word's subtle color and glow do not disrupt the visual flow, maintaining the design harmony.",
