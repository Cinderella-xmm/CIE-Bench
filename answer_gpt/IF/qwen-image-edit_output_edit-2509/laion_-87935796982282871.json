      "question": "Is the surface of the bed covered in patchwork fur made from the colors red, gray, navy, and white, resembling animal fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the bed is covered with a textured material that resembles fur, with a patchwork pattern. The colors, however, are green, brown, and teal, which mimic a camouflage print rather than the colors red, gray, navy, and white. These colors combined with the texture are similar to what might be used to imitate or represent animal fur, deviating from a uniform pattern. Thus, even though the surface resembles fur in texture, the colors are not the same as the original colors.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pillows reshaped into pointed or rounded ears and trimmed with soft-looking leaves along their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the bed includes elements resembling large, pointed ears with soft-looking leaves on the inner sides. These features are not typical bed pillows and provide an animal-like appearance, suggesting a creative reshaping of what originally would be the pillow section into a more whimsical form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the black bed frame been replaced with thin, branch-like legs that resemble natural tree limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the support structure underneath the bed appears altered. The bed frame seems to consist of thin, irregularly shaped elements that resemble tree branches, replacing the conventional look of a straight-lined bed frame typically seen in furniture. These branch-like supports give an impression of an organic, nature-inspired design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a bushy, plush red tail extending from the bottom edge of the comforter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom edge of the bed in Image B, a large, plush, and fluffy red object extends outward. This object bears a strong resemblance to a bushy tail, such as those seen in some animal depictions. This addition is an imaginative modification from a standard bedding setup and clearly presents itself as a tail-like appendage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the patchwork fur on the bed use only the colors red, gray, navy, and white as seen in the original blanket?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the bedding included colors such as red, gray, navy, and white. In contrast, Image B features a patchwork design that consists of different colors, specifically green, brown, and teal, accurately mirroring a camouflage pattern. As a result, the color scheme present in the altered image deviates notably from the original colors seen initially, using an entirely different palette.",
