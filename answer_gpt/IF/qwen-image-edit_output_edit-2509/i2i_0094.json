      "question": "Does the edited image depict the camera with intricate gears and mechanical components characteristic of steampunk design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is surrounded by a complex arrangement of gears, pipes, and mechanical components. These are features commonly associated with steampunk aesthetics, which is a style inspired by industrial machinery from the Victorian era, often depicted with brass, gears, and steam-powered elements. This conclusion is based on the visual cues of intricacy and mechanical design that align with typical steampunk characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the camera and tripod in the edited image rendered with a metallic finish resembling brass, iron, or similar materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera and tripod surfaces have a shiny appearance that visually resembles materials like brass or iron, commonly used in steampunk design. The coloring and texture give a metallic impression characteristic of industrial components, reinforcing the steampunk style's reliance on metallic elements. The gleaming effect seen visually cues a resemblance to polished metallic surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image include visible rivets, bolts, or pipe-like structures as part of the camera and tripod design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays pipe-like structures and various mechanical components including visible gears, rivets, and bolts surrounding the camera and tripod. These elements are typical features in the steampunk design, which emphasizes mechanical complexity and visible assembly, contrasting with smoother, modern design aesthetics. This assessment is based on the richness in mechanical detail evident in the visual composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image emphasize the metallic textures through strong contrasts and reflections, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the lighting is strategically utilized to highlight the metallic textures, with reflections and contrasts creating depth and dimension. The light sources emphasize certain parts of the metallic surface, making the gear details stand out, and giving nuanced visibility to the contours. This effect is typical for showcasing the textures and three-dimensionality of metallic and industrial designs, as seen in steampunk art.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate signs of aging or weathering, such as rust or scratches, on the metallic surfaces of the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible elements that suggest aging or weathering such as small scratches and worn textures, which are consistent with surfaces made to appear older, or used. These features are incorporated into the design to mimic the historical and antiquated look associated with steampunk, reflecting the typical aging effects on metallic components through design marks.",
