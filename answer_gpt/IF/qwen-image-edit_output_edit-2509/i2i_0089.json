      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit a 3D style with depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is depicted with strong depth cues, such as its paw reaching out towards the viewer, suggesting a three-dimensional effect. The perspective and focus on the kitten and the depth created by the background give a sense of volume and space, which is characteristic of a 3D style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the kitten as actively jumping out of the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is shown with its front paw extended forward and its posture suggesting motion towards the viewer, reminiscent of it jumping out of the frame. This poses an active action as if coming out of the screen, which indicates the depiction of jumping.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 3D effect in the image achieved without requiring special glasses or external devices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D effect in Image B appears to be achieved through digital illustration techniques such as perspective, shading, and composition. Since it is a digital image, the sense of depth does not require the use of special 3D glasses or external devices to be perceived, accommodating conventional 2D viewing devices.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the kitten's original appearance, including color and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten retains its orange tabby coloring, striped pattern, and fluffy texture similar to that seen in Image A. There are no alterations in the kitten's basic appearance, as the color and fur detail remain consistent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's features still clearly visible and not obscured by the 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even with the 3D style effect, Image B maintains clear visibility of the kittenâ€™s features, such as its eyes, whiskers, and facial structure. The 3D elements focus on depth but do not obscure these defining features, thereby retaining clear visibility.",
