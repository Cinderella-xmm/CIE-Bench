      "question": "Does the right-side skier cast a shadow that suggests depth and closeness to the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier's shadow is elongated and extends along the slope, following the angle of the sunlight. The shadow's position and angle contribute to creating a sense of depth, as shadows become elongated under the angle of sunlight and provide visual cues about the proximity of the object to the ground, suggesting that the skier is relatively close to the slope and therefore close to the viewer.",

      "question": "Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the right-side skier with a clear and defined edge, without visible motion lines or blurring effects. Motion lines or blurring would typically appear as streaks along the direction of movement, but in this image, the skier and the surrounding snow are sharp, indicating a lack of such effects. Thus, motion is primarily implied through the dynamic pose rather than visual effects.",

      "question": "Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right-side skier in Image B is prominently positioned in the foreground, making them appear closer to the viewer compared to other elements in the scene. The size difference and positioning in the frame emphasize the skier's closeness, providing a sense of immediate foreground presence, distinguishing them from the background mountain range and the other skier.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skier in Image B is shown with a posture that leans forward, with the upper body angled toward the downhill slope and toward the viewer. This typical skiing posture indicates momentum down the slope and toward the position of the viewer, simulating movement and adding to the dynamic quality of the image.",
