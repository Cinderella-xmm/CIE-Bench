    "Question": "Q1: Has melted cheese been added on top of the hot dog?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a yellow substance that resembles melted cheese is visible on top of the hot dogs. The smooth and creamy texture of this topping is consistent with how melted cheese appears. Typically, cheese on hot dogs melts in a uniform layer, as is seen here. There is no such substance atop the hot dogs in Image A. Therefore, the visual cues in Image B indicate that melted cheese has indeed been added.",

    "Question": "Q2: Have fried onions been added on top of the hot dog?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows thin, brownish strips layered on top of the hot dogs.

In Image A, there are no such strips visible; hence, based on visual examination and what fried onions typically look like, Image B does have fried onions added on top.",
