      "question": "Is the entire urban street scene recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is depicted using elements characteristic of Lego bricks. The buildings, cobblestone street, and the figure all feature the distinct block construction and surface texture typical of Lego. The visual cues, such as the smooth lines, uniform construction, and the bright primary colors, align with common representations seen in Lego themes. This scene captures the recognizable aesthetic style of Lego, which often includes simplified and modular designs. Without needing to reference Image A, the scene clearly presents a recreation using Lego bricks, evident from the design and assembly style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cobblestones on the path represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the path with characteristics consistent with Lego bricks. The cobblestones are portrayed as uniformly shaped and placed using repeated patterns and connectivity that mimic the interlocking nature of Lego structures. The neat alignment and the distinct surface texture further affirm their representation as Lego materials. The visual similarities to typical Lego designs solidify this deduction.",

      "question": "Are the buildings in the background recreated using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings in the background are constructed using a style and texture that corresponds closely with Lego brick architecture. The structured, block-like appearance, along with the uniform windows and doors, and the use of modular construction elements, is indicative of Lego designs. This approach aligns with typical Lego sets where buildings often feature simple yet structured appearances.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the man and his clothing, bag, and cap represented using Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man depicted adheres to the LEGO minifigure design: a simplified humanoid form with distinct modular pieces for the cap, clothing, and accessories such as the bag. These items have the smooth, simplified construction and distinct plastic texture associated with LEGO figures and accessories. The clothing also uses LEGO's recognizable style, including the seamless integration of colors and shapes typical of LEGO minifigure attire.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the original composition and perspective of the urban street scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When evaluating Image B in comparison with Image A, the composition and perspective remain consistent, albeit rendered in a different style. Image B retains the same spatial arrangement, with the figure walking along the street center and the buildings framing the path akin to Image A. While style differs dramatically, the layout and perspective are unchanged, demonstrating a deliberate replication of the original composition.",
