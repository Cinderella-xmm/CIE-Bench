      "question": "Is the background replaced with snow and icebergs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the background consists of vast icy surfaces and icebergs against a blue sky and water. This setting is reminiscent of a cold, polar environment typically associated with snow and icebergs. Hence, based on the visual cues, the background in Image B has been replaced with a snowy and icy landscape.",

      "question": "Are the carrots still rooted in soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, carrots are visibly embedded in dark soil despite the surrounding snow. They appear to be growing directly from small patches of soil on top of the snow, with the soil evident around the base of the carrot tops. Therefore, the carrots are still rooted in soil.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the carrots retain their original appearance in terms of color and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrots in Image B show vivid orange color and have green leafy tops, similar to what is expected of carrots in general and their appearance in gardens or farms. Their size, shape, and hue maintain consistency with the typical expectations for carrots. Thus, the carrots retain their original appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image show a clear contrast between the Arctic background and the soil around the carrots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually contrasts the snow and icy environment with the dark soil surrounding the carrots. The stark difference in colors - bright white and blue for the background and dark brown for the soil - highlights the contrast between the Arctic environment and the area where the carrots are planted.",

      "question": "Is the overall setting of the image consistent with an Arctic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inclusion of snow and icebergs as the background along with the cold color palette suggests a setting that aligns with common characteristics of the Arctic environment. Though carrots typically do not grow naturally in such conditions, the image portrays an unnatural blend of plant life with an Arctic backdrop.",
