      "question": "Is the McLaren depicted as a highly detailed 3D-rendered model rather than a photographic image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the McLaren looks highly detailed, with precise lighting, reflections, and shadows consistent with a 3D-rendered model in a controlled environment. The exactitude of the curves and surfaces, combined with the uniformity of reflections and light sources, suggests computer-generated imagery. On the other hand, Image A shows a photographic image of the McLaren in a showroom. Through comparison, we notice Image B's lack of real-world imperfections, supporting the conclusion that it is indeed 3D-rendered.",

      "question": "Is the McLaren enclosed within a transparent acrylic display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is distinctly enclosed within what appears to be a transparent acrylic display case, as evidenced by the visible edges and reflections indicative of an enclosure. Image A shows the car without such a case. Thus, Image B demonstrates the presence of an acrylic case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car rest on a polished chrome base that resembles a rotating platform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the car positioned on a base that has a shiny, polished chrome appearance, which is consistent with the aesthetic of a rotating platform in showrooms or exhibits. Image A shows a standard floor platform without chrome characteristics. This suggests Image B indeed uses a polished chrome base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are subtle carbon fiber textures visible on the interior walls of the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls of the display case in Image B show a pattern that resembles carbon fiber texture, identified by its characteristic weave look. Image A lacks any background indicating display cases, making Image B unique with these textures.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a miniature toolset containing micro wrenches and screwdrivers visible and neatly arranged inside the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible toolset with small items like wrenches and screwdrivers arranged before the McLaren. Image A contains no such items within the scene. Image B confirms this arrangement inside the case.",

      "question": "Is a laser-etched cityscape silhouette visible around the display case, enhancing the urban aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cityscape design on the backdrop of the display, which is reminiscent of laser-etching techniques used for aesthetic purposes. Since Image A does not feature any such design, Image B enhances the urban aesthetic with this feature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall scene maintain a high-end showroom aesthetic with premium materials and professional lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's use of polished chrome, acrylic, carbon fiber textures, and etched designs, combined with strategic lighting, conveys a high-end showroom aesthetic. Image A does show a showroom, but without the premium feel contributed by Image B's enhancements. Thus, Image B maintains a high-end aesthetic.",
