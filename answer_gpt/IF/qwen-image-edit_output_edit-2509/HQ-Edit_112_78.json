      "question": "Has the teapot been transformed into a candle holder with a visible candle or wick structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object present on the marble base is a candle holder with a visible candle and a wick at the top, suggesting it is a candle holder, not a teapot. This conclusion is drawn from the recognizable features of a candle, such as the waxy appearance and the central wick. Without direct comparison to Image A, these features imply a complete transformation from a teapot to a candle holder.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      "explanation": "The lid in Image B has a decorative finial-style design. This is indicative of a decorative element often seen in candle snuffer designs.
