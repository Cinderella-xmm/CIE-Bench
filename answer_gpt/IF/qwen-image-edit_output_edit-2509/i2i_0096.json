      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image show a left-side 90-degree view of the sofa alongside the front view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows only the front view of the sofa. Only the front face, seating cushions, and the backrest pillows are visible clearly, with no other angles displayed. Typically, a 90-degree left-side view would feature the armrest and side profile of the sofa, but these are absent, indicating the view is strictly frontal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dimensions of the sofa consistent between the front and left-side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B only presents a front view without any 90-degree side perspectives, there is no context for comparing dimensional consistency between front and side views. The observed dimensions in Image B are consistent for a frontal view without an accompanying side view for comparison.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the front and side views of the sofa smooth and coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display both a front and a side view of the sofa. The image only presents the frontal aspect, meaning there is no transition visible between different viewpoints of the sofa that would demonstrate coherence or smoothness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the sofa consistent in both the front and side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only features a frontal view of the sofa. Therefore, the lighting and shadows observed pertain strictly to this view alone, with no side view present to allow for comparison of consistency across different perspectives.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do objects around the sofa (e.g., wall art) appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the combined view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall art is positioned and scaled to complement the frontal view of the sofa. The artwork appears centered above the sofa, which is a valid and common aesthetic choice for a living space. Since there is no combined view, only the frontal arrangement is assessable, and it does appear correctly scaled and positioned within the image details.",
