      "question": "Is the sparrow depicted in a 3D-rendered form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow appears to have a smooth surface with slight reflections and shading that are typical in computer-generated imagery, making it look 3D-rendered. The depth, lighting, and finish on the feathers are indicative of a 3D model rather than a real, naturally photographed sparrow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit the animation style characteristic of Pixar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, while showing a polished 3D model, does not particularly reflect Pixar's animation style, which often includes exaggerated features and a particular charm or distinctive characteristic style. The sparrow in the edited image lacks these exaggerated cartoonish features and maintains more realistic proportions and visual details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sparrow perched on the wooden chair in a realistic manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow is positioned on the chair's rail in a way that resembles how a real bird might perch. This indicates a realistic way of placing the bird in the scene, considering the bird's claws appear to securely grasp the chair's backrest, which would align with natural bird behavior.",

      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sparrow and the chair display high-quality, polished textures. The wood of the chair shows detailed grain and smoothness, while the sparrow's feathers and details are vividly portrayed, suggesting attention to both texture and fine detail in the rendering process.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are vibrant and saturated. The hues of the sparrow's feathers and the wood of the chair are notably bright and rich, which lends a lively and visually engaging quality to the image. This use of vivid colors enhances the overall aesthetic appeal.",
