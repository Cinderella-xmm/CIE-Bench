    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the compass been transformed into a bottle-shaped object with a distinct body, neck, and cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that resembles the compass from Image A has been transformed into a bottle-like form. The typical features of a bottle are visible: a circular body, a defined neck, and a cap, suggesting that it now represents a bottle instead of a traditional compass.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the object a circular glass-like container with the compass face visible as an embossed or raised pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the object appears to be a circular and transparent container. The design of the compass face seems integrated as an embossed pattern at the top side of the container, indicating it is part of the design rather than a functioning compass inlay.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the compass needle been replaced with a metal spray nozzle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the central component of the bottle, it appears that what resembles the compass needle in Image A has been modified to look like a spray nozzle. The shape and positioning imply an adaptation suitable for dispersing liquid, consistent with a spray mechanism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cap of the object feature an engraving resembling a vintage map?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap of the bottle includes a decorative engraving. This engraving does not resemble a map, as it lacks lines or features typical of vintage cartography; instead, it might be an artistic or thematic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the object have a bronze-toned gradient finish that gives it an antique appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire object, including the cap and body, has a finish with warm, bronze tones typical of aged metals, especially seen in antique objects. The gradient effect enhances the antique aesthetic further, making the object look vintage and old.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there minimalist branding (such as small text or logo) imprinted around the rim of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing closely, Image B does show some circular text around the rim of the bottle. However, this text appears to be decorative rather than identifying branding or logos typically associated with modern commercial objects.",
