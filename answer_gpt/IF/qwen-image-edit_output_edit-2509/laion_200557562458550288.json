        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows a dynamic scene with a cyclist character wearing the jersey, as opposed to Image A which displays the jersey in a static, flat format.

    {

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall layout combine structured composition (e.g., balanced elements) with energetic visual cues (e.g., motion lines, strong angles)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
