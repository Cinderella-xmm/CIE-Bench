    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the object now shaped like a modern energy drink can instead of a sneaker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object remains a sneaker with a high-top structure. The visual cues such as the shape, laces, and branding typical to a sneaker are present, which indicates it is not transformed into an energy drink can. Common sense and visual features confirm the sneaker shape remains unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the can feature the navy blue mesh pattern from the original sneaker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sneaker that has a deep navy blue mesh pattern on the upper part, similar to many athletic shoes. There is no transformation into a can structure; hence, the pattern remains on the sneaker as observed visually.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo (circular emblem with red and blue sections) visible on the front of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, continues to display the sneaker with the logo visible on the side of the shoe's upper part. As such, it confirms the presence of the brand emblem, however, since there's no can transformation, the logo is not on the front of a can.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bold laces represented as embossed or raised textures wrapped around the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows laces that are characteristic of sneakers; they are not transformed or represented as embossed textures on a can. Visual observation displays the typical sneaker design unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the three navy blue stripes from the sole appear as a dynamic pattern on the bottom half of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker displays navy blue stripes on the sole which continue to form part of the shoe. There is no transformation into a can, so the stripes remain on the sneaker rather than forming a dynamic can pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the word \"Kickstart\" written in red lettering on the white upper portion of the can?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes the word 'Kickstart' in red letters on the sneaker's side, indicating a visual modification involving text. The term is on the sneaker's white area, however, since no can is present, the placement isn't on a can's surface.",
