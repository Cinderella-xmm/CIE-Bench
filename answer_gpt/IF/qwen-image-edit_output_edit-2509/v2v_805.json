      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central object is a snow globe containing the illustration of an open book, which contrasts with Image A where there is a simple illustration of an open book solely. Hence, the original book design has been transformed into a snow globe. This indicates a replacement from a flat illustration to a more three-dimensional concept.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to the right of the snow globe, there is a lamp which is emitting a soft golden light. The light appears to interact with the snow globe, producing noticeable sparkles due to refraction and reflection within the globe's snowy environment. This is typical for how light behaves with glass objects such as snow globes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book inside the snow globe in Image B is presented as a three-dimensional object with a compact form, possibly considered chibi-style due to its stylized, simplified nature. The presence of fluttering-like page designs amidst a snowy effect further suggests a dynamic, miniature setup typical in snow globes portraying winter scenes.",
