      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding elements exhibit clear geometric contours and segmented areas resembling stained glass panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree and surrounding elements are defined by prominent lines that segment the artwork into distinct areas, which is characteristic of stained glass panels. This involves using bold outlines to separate different color segments, much like how stained glass is structured. The tree itself is central, surrounded by radiating lines suggesting panes or sections, reinforcing the resemblance to stained glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree’s branches composed of angular, geometric shapes rather than organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree maintains a natural form with branches that are smoother and more organically curved, rather than angular or geometric. While the lines that separate segments of the image have a structured appearance, the natural curvature of the tree’s branches prevails, not showing a geometric modification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the grass rendered in desaturated, low-saturation colors consistent with a muted palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass appears slightly muted compared to a highly saturated color palette but is not entirely desaturated. The colors are fairly vibrant, with a reasonably rich green tone that wouldn't be described as low saturation or fully muted, but rather balanced between vibrancy and nuance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mountains depicted with sharp, angular forms and colored in shades of bronze and teal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted with angular, sharp lines and contours, consistent with the stained glass style. However, their coloration is more aligned with hues of blue-green and gray than distinctly bronze and teal, though they do exhibit a stylized color scheme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient and include visible accentuated lines or decorative patterns that convey vintage elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is characterized by visible lines that suggest a segmented or paneled effect, common in stained glass, which adds a decorative quality. These segments and the smooth transition of colors across them give an element of vintage elegance. While the individual segments may not show a gradient, combined they convey a blended or gradient effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the elements in the image composed of flat, solid-colored regions bounded by dark, defined lines characteristic of stained glass art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements like the tree, mountains, and sky segments are indeed composed of flat, distinct colors delineated by bold, dark lines. This composition method mirrors the traditional characteristics of stained glass artwork, where different colored glass pieces are separated by the metal framework, creating sharply defined sections.",
