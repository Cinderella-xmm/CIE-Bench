      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that there are five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls, each distinct yet cohesive in design. The dolls are colorful and feature patterns typical of traditional nesting dolls. Given this visual evidence, it is apparent that the original pyramid from Image A has been artistically reimagined or replaced with these nesting dolls in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the nesting dolls feature pyramid-inspired designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls have various decorative designs. A closer look reveals that one of the dolls features a design reminiscent of pyramids, incorporating triangular shapes that are typically associated with pyramid imagery. This indicates that the dolls do include pyramid-inspired designs.",

      "question": "Are the nesting dolls arranged in descending size order?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the nesting dolls arranged from largest to smallest when viewed from left to right. This order is characteristic of traditional Russian nesting dolls, which are generally displayed in descending size. The arrangement is visually clear and logical based on size.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface on which the nesting dolls are placed appears to be made of wood with a polished and refined finish. This can be identified from the grain and sheen, suggesting it is a sophisticated wooden table. It is visually apparent from the texture and color typical of wooden surfaces.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A visual analysis of Image B suggests a standard rectangular format. To determine the aspect ratio, one would typically compare the proportions of width to height by visual cues. Without precise measurements, estimating a 3:2 aspect ratio is reasonable based on typical formatting practices and visual observation.",
