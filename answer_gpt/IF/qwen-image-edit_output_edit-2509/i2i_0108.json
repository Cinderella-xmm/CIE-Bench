      "question": "Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is shown from the waist up, which qualifies as a half-body depiction. The 3D effect is evident through the character's break-out from a digital screen and the realistic depth seen in the image. Therefore, the character is effectively depicted as a 3D half-body figure.",

      "question": "Does the character appear to be breaking out from a television screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is positioned to appear breaking through a screen, with digital cracks and fragments surrounding it, creating the illusion of bursting out. These visual cues indicate that the image is designed to simulate the character breaking out from a television screen.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character holds the shield prominently in front of their torso, angled in a way typical of a defensive stance. The visual cues reinforce the impression of the character being in a defensive posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image simulate an augmented reality display effect through lighting, shadows, and spatial realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses lighting and shadows around the character and the digital screen to create depth and realism, simulating the effect of augmented reality. The character's posture, along with the cracked screen fragments, enhance the 3D and immersive feel, suggestive of augmented reality.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the character's original appearance and posture been maintained while implementing the new effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the character's posture appears unchanged, maintaining the defensive shield-raising pose. The effects in Image B primarily focus on augmenting the background and creating a breakout effect. Therefore, the character's original appearance and posture have been maintained in the edited image.",
