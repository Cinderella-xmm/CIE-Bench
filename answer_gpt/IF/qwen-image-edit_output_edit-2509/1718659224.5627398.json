      "question": "Is the fortress constructed entirely from golden-brown cookie dough with darker edges resembling baked edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a fortress that is structured entirely using parts that look like golden-brown cookies. The design incorporates darker edges, which mimic the appearance of the baked edges of cookies. This visual feature, combined with the understanding of baking aesthetics and cookie structures, indicates that the fortress is indeed made to resemble cookie dough with its specific color and detail work.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the walls and towers of the fortress have a golden-brown base color with visibly darker edges, mimicking baked cookie dough?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fortress seen in Image B has walls and towers characterized by a golden-brown color with edges that are visibly darker. This coloration is quite typical of baked goods, specifically baked cookies, where the edges often appear darker due to browning. This design choice appropriately imitates the appearance of baked cookie dough.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as finely piped, smooth, and glossy streams resembling royal icing rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls are shown as smooth and glossy streams with a distinctly piped appearance. The texture and appearance closely resemble that of royal icing used in decorative baking, rather than the more irregular appearance of natural water. This visual cue suggests it is intended to mimic icing rather than real water.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees in the image made from smooth, uniformly green-colored marzipan with no realistic leaf detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B appear smooth and uniformly colored in green, lacking the intricate details of real leaves. This smoothness and solid color suggest the use of marzipan or similar confectionery material, which is commonly used in baking for creating uniform and stylized decorative elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cookie castle placed on a large, flat, white ceramic platter that is clearly visible beneath and around the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image shows the cookie castle positioned on a wide, flat surface that appears to be a white ceramic platter. The platter's color and material are typical of ceramic serving dishes, and it is visibly supporting and surrounding the castle structure, indicating this setting.",
