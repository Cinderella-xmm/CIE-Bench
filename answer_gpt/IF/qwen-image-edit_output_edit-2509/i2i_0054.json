      "question": "Is the background changed to a matte solid gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a uniform color without any variations or patterns, which is consistent with a matte solid gray appearance. This type of background is often used in photography to bring focus to the main subject without distractions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana rests on a metal stand, and there is a subtle shadow underneath the stand, indicating the presence of a shadow cast. Shadows can be used to create depth and indicate a light source within an image.",

      "question": "Are the banana shape and metal stand curves highlighted effectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image uses lighting to define the curves of both the banana and the metal stand. The contours and shine of the metal, along with the smooth surface of the banana, are well accentuated, making the curves visually distinct.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of a single banana supported by a metal stand against a solid gray background has no additional objects or patterns. This absence of extraneous details embodies the principles of minimalistic design, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the main objects.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Minimalistic design is characterized by simplicity and focus on essential elements. Image B, with its clear presentation of a banana and a stand on a monochromatic background without distraction, aligns well with minimalist design standards by maintaining simplicity and emphasis.",
