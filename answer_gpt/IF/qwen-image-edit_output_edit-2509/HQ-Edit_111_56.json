      "question": "Is the ballerina depicted as a stone sculpture rather than a living person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be a stone sculpture. The surface reflects characteristics typical of marble, such as a smooth texture, and lacks liveliness typical of a living person. Elements indicate a transition to sculpture material through subdued color and structure.",

        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual analysis, Image B shows a distinct addition—a stylized laurel wreath on the head, which is indicative of classical Greek representations, and this element is absent in Image A.",

      ],
