    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the vase now composed of clear, faceted crystal material that mimics the original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a vase composed of clear, faceted crystal, with visible geometric patterns and the characteristics typical of crystal glass. These properties indicate modification from a ceramic vase to a crystal vase, which is different from the ceramic material seen in Image A's ornate vase.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative panels on the vase replaced with etched abstract floral patterns in crystal, rather than painted figures or scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image, Image B, shows a vase with etched floral patterns typical of crystal glass, indicating that the decorative panels have been changed to abstract patterns. In contrast, Image A has painted figurative panels on the ceramic vase.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all the flowers been replaced with pastel-colored, translucent, intricately carved crystal blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers appear pastel-toned, translucent, and delicately carved, suggestive of crystal or glass craftsmanship. This contrasts with Image A, which features natural, colorful blooms. Thus, all the flowers have been replaced by crystal blossoms in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vase placed on a minimalist, flat, reflective mirrored pedestal that shows a clear reflection of the vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the vase standing on a flat surface that appears reflective but does not show a clear reflection. The surface is simple compared to the ornate table in Image A, but there is no indication of a mirrored pedestal providing a clear reflection of the items.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the same overall shape, size, and structural features (such as handles and foot) as the original ornate vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is simplified into a standard faceted glass shape without ornate features seen in Image A, such as large handles and decorative footing. This reflects a change in design and structure from the original shape and feature set.",
