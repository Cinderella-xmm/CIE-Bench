      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparison of Image A and Image B shows that the elements – the sofa, cushions, rug, plant, and wall art – remain unchanged between images. The only difference in Image B is the inclusion of text ('warm' and 'freedom').",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of 'warm' in the top left and 'freedom' in the bottom right of Image B is balanced, as they do not overpower or distract from other elements like the painting or furniture. The text size and positioning are designed to enhance the thematic elements without disrupting the overall visual harmony.",
