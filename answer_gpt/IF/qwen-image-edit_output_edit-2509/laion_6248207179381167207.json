      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main surface of the handbag displays vibrant turquoise color with silver geometric patterns replacing the previous brown-toned Louis Vuitton monogram design.

      "question": "Do the leather straps feature metallic accents such as silver trim, hardware, or reflective finishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather straps are adorned with silver hardware, evident from the shiny metallic components, like buckles and decorative fasteners. The reflective nature and metal accents add sophistication to the handbag, compared to the plain leather strap in Image A. This alteration is clearly visible as the metal parts have a lustrous finish, typical of metallic elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases intricate engravings along the edges of the handbag, featuring designs indicative of machine-age aesthetics. These include well-defined, symmetrical lines and patterns around the perimeters, suggesting an attention to detail that aligns with a stylistic choice seen in industrial or machine-age design, which was absent in the simpler edging of Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall design in Image B strongly reflects Art Deco style, characterized by its geometric patterns, symmetry, polished metallic finishes, and refined elegance. The turquoise and silver color scheme, combined with intricate engravings, and symmetrical arrangements are hallmarks of Art Deco design.

      "explanation": "Despite the dramatic stylistic overhaul outlined in Image B, the structural form and proportions of the handbag remain consistent with those observed in Image A. Both images indicate a rectangular form with two front pockets and a top zip closure. The preservation of the handbag's fundamental shape confirms the continuity in structural form despite noticeable changes in design elements.",
