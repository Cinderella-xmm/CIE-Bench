        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle is depicted with exaggerated features typical of chibi-style design, such as rounded edges, a large headlight, and overall cute, toy-like proportions that are consistent with a 3D cartoon aesthetic. This style is especially noted for its focus on cuteness, often used in animated series and merchandise. The object reflects a transformation into a playful and whimsical form, differing significantly from realistic representations.",
