      "question": "Is the sandwich depicted in a thick-painted cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a sandwich drawn in a bold cartoon style characterized by thick outlines and vivid colors. The shapes are exaggerated, and the shading uses flat colors with comprehensive outlines, which is typical of cartoon illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich cross-section clearly emphasized with distinct textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandwich layers are simplified, and textures are not distinct. Instead, flat colors and outlines are used to represent different sandwich components like the bread, lettuce, and cheese. These techniques do not emphasize textures but rather silhouette and color separation, common in cartoon styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the lettuce been simplified into smeared green shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce is depicted as large, flat green shapes, with less emphasis on detail and more on color uniformity and shape. This simplification is consistent with cartooning approaches where textures are often abstracted or stylized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there sauce decorations added around the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows sauce decorations in a red zigzag pattern on the plate. This feature is an addition not present in the original Image A, enhancing the decorative aspect which aligns with visually stimulating cartoon imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon style in Image B fits well with modern Western restaurant menu visuals, which often aim to capture attention with colorful, playful illustrations of food items. The bold colors and simplified shapes could cater to contemporary design preferences in menu aesthetics.",
