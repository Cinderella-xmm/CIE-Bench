      "question": "Has the forest background been replaced with a city balcony railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background clearly shows a bird perched on what appears to be a railing, compared to the natural forest scenery visible in Image A. This transition from a natural setting to an urban one confirms the replacement of the forest background with a city balcony railing. The visual cues of a railing and city-like structures in the background support this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bird positioned on the sunlit balcony as instructed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is perched on a railing, and there is a noticeable sunlight effect on the bird as well as on the railing. The bird's position appears natural and consistent with being on a balcony that receives sunlight, indicating that the bird is indeed positioned on a sunlit balcony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a blurred city skyline visible in the background of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a variety of indistinct vertical shapes that resemble the silhouette of buildings, typical of a city skyline. This bokeh effect, commonly used to blur background details, enhances the focus on the bird and suggests a cityscape in the distance, affirming the presence of a blurred city skyline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bird maintain its original position relative to the new balcony railing background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is perched on the railing in a similar manner to its position in the original image on the tree branch. The bird's placement and posture seem consistent in both images, implying it maintains its relative position despite the change in background from a branch to a balcony railing.",

      "question": "Does the overall lighting of the image match the sunlit balcony setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B shows bright illumination on the bird, with visible highlights and a warm tone consistent with sunlight. The shadows and light reflections on the railing further emphasize this effect, aligning with what one would expect from a sunlit balcony setting.",
