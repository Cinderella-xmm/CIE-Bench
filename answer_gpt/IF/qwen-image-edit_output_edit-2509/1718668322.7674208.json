      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B suggest the presence of a sleek metal armor suit.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the armor suggests joints specifically at the shoulder area. The presence of segmented sections and the spacing implies the existence of articulated joints for movement and flexibility, common in modern armor designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents hair that appears as strands of polished wire, depicted in metallic blue and yellow colors. The structured, linear appearance and unnatural metallic hues contrast with natural hair, indicating they are indeed styled as wire-like.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images have blurred faces, making facial feature comparison irrelevant. However, the posture comparison is possible: Image B shows a different posture compared to what is visible from the rest of the figure in Image A. The arm positioning and overall body orientation suggest a change.",
