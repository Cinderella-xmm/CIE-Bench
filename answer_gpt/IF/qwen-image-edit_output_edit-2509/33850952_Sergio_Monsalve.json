    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the building facade now appear as an organic, alien-like structure rather than a conventional architectural design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the structure has transformed significantly from a modern architectural design to what looks like an alien construct. The organic shapes, tentacle-like appendages, and surreal colors contribute to an extraterrestrial look, deviating from conventional architectural styles. This perception is compounded by the unusual textures and glowing elements, which are more typical in science fiction or alien design motifs rather than traditional architecture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the curved elements of the building transformed into distinct tentacle-like appendages extending from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curved elements originally present within the architectural design are altered to include tentacle-like forms protruding from the structure. These appendages appear to be reminiscent of tentacles due to the way they twist and curve, suggesting a transformation from rigid architectural components to living, organic extensions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are fibrous, strand-like textures visibly applied across sections of the buildingâ€™s exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows fibrous textures across its surface resembling strands or tendrils. This texture contrasts with the smooth, metallic finish of a typical architectural facade and suggests an organic transformation, providing an impression that the structure consists of living fibers or strands.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all window surfaces been replaced with translucent, membrane-like panels that appear soft and non-rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The translucent areas in Image B do not resemble traditional windows but rather appear as soft, membrane-like panels. The traditional rigid glass seen in windows is replaced with a material that seems non-solid and flexible, contributing to the alien aesthetic of the structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the metal surface detailed with overlapping, iridescent scale-like patterns that reflect multiple colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surfaces exhibit iridescent, scale-like patterns overlapping each other, reflecting various colors. This transformation from a smooth metal surface to one with an iridescent quality, often seen in biological organisms like fish or reptiles, emphasizes the alien transformation of the structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there glowing, bio-luminescent lines along the edges of the structure that emit an eerie, unnatural light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes glowing lines along the edges, creating a bio-luminescent effect. These lines emit a soft, eerie light, typical of a natural bio-luminescence seen in organisms that possess this ability, reinforcing the alien theme of the image.",
