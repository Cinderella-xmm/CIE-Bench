    "Question": "Q1: Is the armored figure visibly smaller in scale compared to its original form, consistent with being a miniature sculpture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figure is enclosed within a dome, which typically houses miniature objects for display. The proportion of the figure relative to the dome suggests it is indeed smaller in scale, consistent with being a miniature sculpture. This visual cue indicates a transformation from a human-sized form to a smaller, scaled-down version.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the armored figure enclosed within a transparent dome featuring metallic structural elements consistent with steampunk design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figure is clearly housed within a transparent dome, and the visual cues such as metallic gears and filigree designs align with the steampunk aesthetic, which often incorporates gears, brass elements, and an overall mechanical design. The presence of these elements supports the conclusion that the design is consistent with steampunk.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there visible rotating cogwheels located at the base of the structure beneath the figure?",
    "explanation": "The base of the structure in Image B presents multiple cogwheels, consistent with mechanisms found in steampunk designs. These rotating cogwheels are a prominent feature in steampunk, adding a mechanical and industrial element to the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there small mechanical wings attached to the back of the armored figure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figure is depicted with small wings that are designed to resemble mechanical constructs. This is consistent with steampunk aesthetics, which often feature mechanical adaptations of traditional elements. The appearance of these wings confirms their presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible copper-colored piping details integrated into the surface of the armor?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays copper-colored piping details on the figure's armor. Copper is frequently used in steampunk design to create a vintage industrial look, which is evident in this image. These copper details are integrated into the armor, aligning with the steampunk style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there multiple spherical brass filigree objects suspended in the air around the figure, mimicking planetary orbits?",
    "explanation": "Image B has multiple spherical objects made from brass filigree hovering around the figure, suggestive of planetary orbits. The arrangement and design create the impression of celestial bodies, contributing to the steampunk theme by adding an element of mysticism and complexity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the brass filigree orbs arranged in a way that creates a sense of orbiting celestial bodies, contributing to a mystical ambiance?",
    "explanation": "The arrangement of brass filigree orbs in Image B mimics the appearance of orbiting celestial bodies, which enhances the mystical ambiance. Such configurations are typical in designs that aim to evoke themes of astronomy and mysticism, complemented here by the steampunk elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
