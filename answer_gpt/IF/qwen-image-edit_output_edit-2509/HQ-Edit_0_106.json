      "question": "Is the lion rendered as a high-contrast silhouette with minimal internal detail and strong edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is depicted as a silhouette with no internal details visible; only its outline is clearly defined against the vibrant background, indicating a high-contrast treatment. The absence of details like fur texture or facial features suggests that it is rendered as a silhouette.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an abstract gradient composed of smooth color transitions rather than a realistic savannah landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with smooth transitions between warm colors like red and orange, creating an abstract gradient effect. This contrasts with typical realistic savannah elements such as foliage detail or distinct terrain characteristics.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground grass is depicted in broad strokes and does not show individual, detailed textures of blades, making it less detailed compared to realistic depictions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, acacia trees appear as dark silhouettes without texture or shading, resembling angular outlines. These forms are simplified and geometric compared to realistic depictions, emphasizing stylization.",
