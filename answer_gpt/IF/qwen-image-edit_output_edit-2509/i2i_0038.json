      "question": "Has the person's pose and expression been simplified into a cartoon line-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall presentation has been transformed into a line-art style, which simplifies complex visual elements into basic contrast lines and shapes. This change is indicative of a cartoonization process, where details like shadowing and depth are reduced to produce a flat, stylized portrayal similar to a comic or cartoon. Based on these observations, it is clear that the person's pose and expression follow this pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the raised hand still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon drawing depicts a hand raised in the same orientation as in Image A. This consistency suggests that the original pose was retained in the transition from a photographic to an illustrated format. Hence, the presence of the raised hand is conserved.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cartoon-style person retain an open mouth expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no representation of an open mouth within the simplified cartoon format. The face and its expressions are either absent or not detailed in Image B, indicating that specific facial expressions like an open mouth are not retained.",

      "question": "Does the cartoon-style image include a camera covering part of the person's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration clearly shows a camera that obscures part of the person’s face, similar to the position of the photographic camera in Image A. The presence of this camera maintains the same visual cue of coverage, aligning with the original photo's composition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a speech bubble is explicitly drawn with the phrase “Take a photo.” This addition is a common element in cartoons to convey dialogue or thoughts, emphasizing communication in the scene.",
