        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church and surrounding landscape are depicted within a transparent, dome-shaped case which matches the common visual characteristics of a glass dome, with its curved top and enclosing structure. This visual cue, combined with common knowledge of snow globes or display cases, confirms that the church and landscape are encased within a dome-shaped glass case.",

      "question": "Does the church tower feature a detailed clock face with Roman numerals and visible hands, and does it have a copper-colored roof?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church tower has a detailed clock face, with Roman numerals clearly visible and other clock components. The roof appears to have a greenish tint, suggesting a patina often associated with copper, although not explicitly copper-colored, it indicates aged copper. The visual information combined with the common understanding of church architecture suggests that these features meet the criteria described.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hills are shown with terraces cut into the landscape and rows that resemble vineyard planting patterns, demonstrating typical vineyard arrangements. The visual likeness to known vineyard structures confirms the presence of terraces and rows of vineyards.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides visual cues of small houses with architectural features typical of alpine-style, such as steep roofs and wooden elements, which align with regional architectural styles. Their proportions in relation to the church imply a miniature scale. The visual details and common understanding verify these houses are consistent with alpine-style architecture.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
