      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visibly showcases a structured scene surrounded by a glass terrarium. The container's contour and reflective properties, indicative of glass, create a visible enclosure around the scene. This visual cue, coupled with world knowledge about terrariums as decorative enclosed units, suggests the scene is indeed within a glass terrarium structure.",

      "question": "Are the snow-capped peaks made of visibly textured and glittering materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow on the mountain peaks appears detailed with texture, akin to a sprinkle of glitter, suggesting a crafted material used to create the effect. This conclusion is derived from the visual cue of a textured and sparkling appearance, typical of crafted scenes in ornamental displays, rather than the natural texture seen in genuine landscapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the landscape feature intricately detailed, fine-brushed foliage instead of natural-looking vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foliage within Image B's scene appears highly detailed with finely brushed elements, likely crafted to represent trees and bushes in a miniature model environment. This observation comes from noticing the clear definition and structure of the vegetation, typical in model landscapes, contrasting with natural, less uniform foliage.",

      "question": "Is the lake represented by a reflective, translucent resin-like surface with a synthetic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a lake with a surface that exhibits a reflective and translucent quality typical of resin or similar synthetic materials used in artistic models. The visual compatibility with synthetic representations, rather than naturally occurring bodies of water, indicates the lake is crafted with materials giving a resin-like sheen.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoreline features small, realistically detailed chalet figurines, identifiable through their constructed appearance and placement around the lake. This particular style is typical of model or ornamental displays, given their scale and intricate detailing.",
