      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a hand-painted watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall visual impression is that of a watercolor painting. The image has a soft, painterly texture and appearance, which is characteristic of hand-painted watercolor art. This style is achieved by using light washes and subtle gradients rather than sharp lines or photorealistic details. This is consistent with the watercolor style that gives an overall artistic and blended feel to the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the foreground woman depicted in greater detail compared to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground woman, while still stylized with a watercolor effect, appears to have more detail and focus in her rendering compared to the background figures. The texture and shading used on her suggest a slightly higher level of attention to detail, common in artistic compositions where the main subject is emphasized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background figures represented with light-colored linework and faint washes rather than detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background figures in Image B are depicted with less detail, characterized by soft outlines and minimal details. They exhibit a light-colored linework and faint washes, typical of a watercolor style where the background is intentionally kept subdued to avoid drawing focus away from the main subject.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the woman appear to be elegantly raising her glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture and placement of the woman's hand suggest that she is raising her glass in an elegant manner. Her body language and the angle at which the glass is held contribute to this perception, as it aligns with the common gesture associated with tasting or appreciating a drink.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition structured so that the foreground woman is the central point of attention?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition is structured to emphasize the foreground woman as the central point of attention. Her position is at the forefront, and she is depicted with more detail compared to the background figures, which naturally draws the viewer's eye towards her, highlighting her as the focal point of the image.",
