    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire elephant and savannah scene enclosed within a visible vintage travel case structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the scene are clearly defined by the boundaries of a vintage travel case, which includes metallic clasps and a leather-like texture, suggesting that the whole scene is contained within this case structure. The presence of the case's lid also supports this conclusion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant and landscape elements appear as detailed miniature 3D models with realistic scaling and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements within Image B, such as the elephant, tree, and grassy terrain, are rendered with precise details and shadows, giving them a three-dimensional look. Their proportions and the overall layout suggest that these are miniatures, effectively conveying scale and depth, which indicates realistic modeling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ground covered with a material that resembles grass but has a textured, resin-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the ground appears textured and uniform, akin to artificial turf or a crafted surface, suggesting a resin-like finish rather than natural grass. This is consistent with the creation of a miniature diorama where real grass cannot be used.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a small-scale acacia tree placed in the diorama to indicate scale balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a small acacia tree is clearly visible next to the elephant within the case, likely serving the purpose of scale balance. The tree is detailed yet small enough to maintain the intended miniature scene, suggesting thoughtful scaling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky depicted as painted elements on the inner surface of a backdrop lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B appear to be part of the interior backdrop of the case, aligned on a flat surface consistent with painted features rather than three-dimensional forms, enhancing the pictorial depth by illustrating a sky.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a brass-colored compass placed on the base of the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a brass-colored object resembling a small compass is placed to the left on the base, contributing to the travel theme of the diorama. The distinct design elements, like the circular shape and markings, substantiate its identification as a compass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
