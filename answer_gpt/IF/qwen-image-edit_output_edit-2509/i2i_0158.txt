    "Question": "Q2: Is the left side view of the car clearly visible in the final three-view combination?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the middle section of the three-view combination shows another front view from a slightly different angle, rather than a side view. The angle still emphasizes the front of the car rather than showcasing the side of the vehicle. Therefore, while there are two perspectives of the front, neither present a side view.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the three views of the car presented in a non-overlapping manner, ensuring they are distinct and clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the layout of the three views of the car is structured in a way that each section—front, slightly alternative front, and rear—is distinctly separated, allowing each view to be independently visible.

The layout allows for sufficient visual clarity and appeal, which are essential standards in such publications.",
