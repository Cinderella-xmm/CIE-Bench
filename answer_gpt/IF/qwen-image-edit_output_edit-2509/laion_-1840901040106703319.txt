    "Question": "Q1: Has the log cabin been replaced with a geometric crystal structure made of transparent, faceted surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see a structure with geometric shapes and surfaces that appear transparent and faceted, resembling a crystal. This is notably different from typical log cabin structures, which use solid logs and have a rustic appearance. Therefore, it appears that in Image B, the structure has been transformed into a crystal-like facade recognizable by its transparent and faceted surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the exterior surfaces of the structure consist of transparent, faceted planes that reflect or refract blue and green hues?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior surfaces are transparent and faceted, creating an effect that causes blue and green hues to be visible, likely due to reflection or refraction of light through the crystal-like surfaces. This is a characteristic often associated with transparent materials such as glass or crystals, which can separate and display multiple hues when light passes through.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Have all wooden beams and structural supports been replaced with meticulously cut, multifaceted crystal edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden beams and supports of the original log cabin seem to be replaced by crystal edges that are multifaceted. The surfaces are transparent and angular, quite different from the wooden structure seen in typical cabin construction. This indicates that the transformation involved a change from wood to crystal-like material.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the crystal structure resting on a flat, white marble platform?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the crystal structure on a flat platform that appears to be made of a white material resembling marble. Marble is known for its smooth and polished surface, often white or lightly colored, which fits the appearance of the platform beneath the crystal structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
