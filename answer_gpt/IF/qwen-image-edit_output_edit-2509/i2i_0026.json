      "question": "Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, there are four frames shown. Each frame depicts different stages commonly associated with performing an action in tennis: preparation, swinging the racket, hitting the ball, and the follow-through after hitting. The sequence follows a logical order that aligns with common understanding of an instructional guide on movement techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the illustration drawn in clean line art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B uses clear, defined lines without the addition of shading or color gradients. This aligns with the characteristics of a clean line art style, where the emphasis is on the outline and detail rather than realistic textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the illustration use monochrome color fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not make use of any color fill within the frames. The illustration is fully reliant on lines and outlines, indicating the use of a monochrome theme, where there is an absence of different colors or shades.",

      "question": "Has the background been completely removed from the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows only the figures within each frame against a white background, with no additional elements or scenes included in the backdrop. This suggests that the background has been entirely removed, leaving the focus solely on the characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B is organized in four sequential frames lined up side by side horizontally. This layout is typical for an instructional strip where information or sequences are displayed in a linear manner for easy following and understanding.",
