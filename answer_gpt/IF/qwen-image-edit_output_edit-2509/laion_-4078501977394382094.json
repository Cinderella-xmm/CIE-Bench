      "question": "Is the title \"Desert Adventure Chronicles\" displayed at the top or in a prominent location of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Desert Adventure Chronicles' is clearly visible at the top of the comic strip in bold lettering, indicating that it is in a prominent location. Comic strips often have their titles displayed at the top to draw attention and set the theme. The analysis involves recognizing the positioning and format typical of comic strip titles, confirming visibility and prominence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there exactly three separate panels arranged horizontally or vertically in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is structured as a comic strip with four panels arranged in a grid pattern. This setup does not align with the specification of three separate panels, as there is one extra panel. Common comic strip layouts can consist of various numbers of panels; hence, the reasoning involves identifying the number and arrangement in this particular strip.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the green van in Panel 1 have its roof tilted upward slightly, resembling a hat tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the green van has a hat on its roof, slightly tilted upward in a playful gesture that could mimic a hat tip. This detail is humorously portrayed, aligning with cartoon styling where objects can be exaggerated for effect. The analysis uses visual cues indicating the angle and context of the hat to confirm its position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text bubble in Panel 1 containing the words “Ah, the open road calls!” clearly visible and correctly spelled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text bubble in Panel 1 of Image B reads “Ah, the open load calls!” which is a spelling error for the word 'road.' The examination relies on visual inspection and linguistic understanding to ascertain both visibility and spelling accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the headlights of the van in Panel 2 significantly wider or brighter than in other panels, indicating surprise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 1 displays the van with wide, bright headlights, which is a common cartoon way of expressing surprise or alertness. This effect is not particularly evident in Panel 2, where the lighting does not suggest significant surprise or change compared to Panel 1. The analysis involves comparing the intensity and size of headlights across panels.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the cactus in Panel 2 morph into a fountain-like structure with water spraying or flowing from it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, in a panel different from Panel 2, depicts a fountain-like structure that humorously contrasts with the desert setting. However, Panel 2 itself does not include this transformation; it solely shows a desert landscape with regular cacti. The interpretation involves distinguishing between unique visual features across different panels.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the van in Panel 3 shown splashing water with visible droplets or ripples, and is it parked near a body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, the van is indeed splashing water, evident from the presence of droplets and ripples. The context suggests it's near a body of water, combining the visual representation with typical effects of such a scene in cartoon art where exaggerated actions are common.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there green plants or trees visible around the oasis in Panel 3?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 3 of Image B displays lush green vegetation surrounding the oasis, which includes various plants or trees. Detecting these elements employs common environmental knowledge of oasis settings where vegetation is typically evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Is the overall image width exactly three times its height?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layout of Image B does not conform to a width-to-height ratio of exactly 3:1, as it is structured to fit standard comic strip proportions, where balance is maintained among panels rather than emphasizing extreme length or width. Image dimensions usually reflect artistic and printing norms for comic strips.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q10",
      "question": "Do the colors and art style of the comic strip match the warm, cartoonish, and vibrant style of the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a vibrant, cartoonish art style typical of comic strips, using bright colors and bold outlines that convey humor and adventure, which is similar to Image A's aesthetic. However, Image A primarily employs a more pastel palette and an illustrative style, differing from the bold comic strip look. The evaluation compares thematic and stylistic choices with artistic conventions.",
