      "question": "Does the image display a soft hand-painted texture characteristic of watercolor illustrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a smooth gradient in colors and a gentle blending of hues, which is typical of watercolor paintings. Unlike digital or printed images where divisions between colors and shapes are sharp, watercolor illustrations have softer transitions and a fluid appearance. The entire image appears to have a dreamy, hand-painted quality, visually confirming its watercolor style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bedding patterns from the original image preserved in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bedding retains a similar quilt pattern with distinct star shapes that match the design seen in Image A. Though the technique changes the texture and color blending slightly, the geometric integrity and pattern layout remain the same, indicating preservation of the original bedding design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the colors in the image exhibit a soft blending typical of watercolor paintings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B display a seamless blending effect, characteristic of watercolor works where pigments naturally intermingle on a wet surface. This allows for subtle gradations and gentle shifts in hue, creating a soft and harmonious visual effect that differs from more stark or digitally precise color transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible brush stroke textures or subtle variations in shading throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows variations in shading, particularly in areas where light and color meld fluidly, indicating an intention to mimic a watercolor painting style. Although individual brush strokes are not visibly distinct due to the nature of watercolor, which usually showcases diffuse textures rather than explicit strokes, the varying shading provides depth and artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Can detailed designs in the bedding, like the star patterns, still be clearly seen after conversion to the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the clarity of the star patterns on the bedding, which are discernible and consistent with the original Image A, albeit in a softened form due to the painting style. While watercolor's blending capability can sometimes obscure fine details, here, the structured design remains visible, ensuring the essential patterns are still recognizable.",
