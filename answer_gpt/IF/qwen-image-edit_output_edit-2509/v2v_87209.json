        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible curvilinear patterns with floral and plant-like motifs surrounding and integrating with the central design elements, which are characteristic of the Art Nouveau style known for its organic and flowing forms.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the blue owl and smaller owlets enveloped with swirling lines and intricate botanical patterns. These motifs seem to blend with the figures, suggesting a transformation into more artistic representations rather than just a plain character design.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Owlegories' typography retains its original font style without significant alteration to fit the Art Nouveau aesthetic, which is typically characterized by fluid and dynamic scripts known as whiplash. The text does not exhibit the distinct curves and flow associated with the script that typifies Art Nouveau.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'SHOP NOW' button in Image B appears bold and detached from the surrounding intricate motifs typical of the Art Nouveau design. It stands out as a distinct, modern element and lacks the stylistic integration expected within an Art Nouveau context where elements are often stylized to blend harmoniously.",
