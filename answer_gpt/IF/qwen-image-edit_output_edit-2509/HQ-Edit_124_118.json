    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the scene appear as a digitally rendered holographic installation with visible projection-like effects such as transparency, layering, or digital glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an environment with vibrant neon colors and a strong sense of transparency, especially noticeable in the tree formations and water surfaces. The glow and layering effect suggest a holographic installation, as these are characteristic of digital rendering. The presence of projection-like effects indicates an artificial, digital scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as animated light projections on transparent or reflective glass surfaces instead of natural flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls exhibit a luminous quality and seem to be integrated within transparent glass panels, which gives them an appearance akin to digital projections. The layered panel setup around the waterfalls enhances the perception of them being light projections rather than physical water.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees feature visible iridescent, glowing filaments resembling fiber optics embedded within their trunks and branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases trees with luminous, spiral structures wrapping around their trunks, reminiscent of fiber optics. These glowing filaments emphasize a digital or futuristic aesthetic, deviating from the natural appearance of traditional trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines appear as virtualized, looping structures with light trails or animated effects, forming a kinetic light sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the looping structures around the trees show light trails and photorealistic glow, reminiscent of virtualized elements that suggest motion and kinetic sculpture. These animated effects contribute to a sense of dynamic and futuristic artistry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the environment integrated with futuristic architectural elements such as glass panels, geometric structures, or artificial lighting that blend with the natural forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B integrates elements such as transparent panels with geometric designs that simulate natural forms through artificial lighting. The presence of these futuristic elements blends harmoniously with the depicted natural scenery, highlighting an architecture-interlaced environment.",
