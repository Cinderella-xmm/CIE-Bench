      "question": "Is the robot now a miniature 3D articulated model instead of a full-sized giant robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is encased in a glass dome, suggesting it is a collectible or model. It is situated on a small base with a simulated environment, indicating that it is no longer a full-sized robot but rather a scaled-down version meant for display.",

      "question": "Is the robot enclosed within a circular display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the robot is encased in a glass dome, which is a common form for display cases for models and collectibles, confirming that it is enclosed within a circular display case.",

      "question": "Are there visible tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot's surface in Image B does not showcase any transparent panels revealing tiny gears. The structure appears similar to what one might expect from a mechanical robot model, but no specific detail of tiny gears under transparent panels can be observed.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly presents the display seated on a black base, which is hexagonal in shape. This can be identified from the edges and corners visible in the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an inscription on the black base. The text appears to be in a luminous font, but the exact nature or content (like a model number) is indecipherable due to its stylized appearance. However, it's clear there is an attempt to give the impression of a labeled model number.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a small landscape inside the display dome around the robot, which includes elements like small trees and varied terrain, resembling the original image's elements, albeit in a miniaturized form.",
