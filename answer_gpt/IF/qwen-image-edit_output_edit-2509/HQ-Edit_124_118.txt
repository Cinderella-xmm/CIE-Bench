    "Question": "Q1: Does the scene appear as a digitally rendered holographic installation with visible projection-like effects such as transparency, layering, or digital glow?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents an environment with vibrant neon colors and a strong sense of transparency, especially noticeable in the tree formations and water surfaces. The glow and layering effect suggest a holographic installation, as these are characteristic of digital rendering. The presence of projection-like effects indicates an artificial, digital scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
