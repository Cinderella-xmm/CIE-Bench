      "question": "Are all spheres and cubes replaced with LEGO brick shapes that retain the original marbled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all objects appear as LEGO brick shapes that have maintained the marbled patterns similar to those seen in Image A. The spheres and cubes of Image A are transformed into rectangular LEGO bricks with a similar consistent marble design evident on each piece. The same marbled colors and textures are present, indicating a pattern retention from the original objects to the bricks.",

      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a matte surface texture without reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks appear to have a matte finish. There are no apparent glossy or reflective highlights on the bricks, indicating a non-reflective texture. Especially when considering the surface of the bricks, they lack any shiny attributes which would otherwise show a reflective quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks arranged in an orderly, structured pattern on a wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows LEGO bricks arranged in a neat, structured formation, resembling a pyramid shape. This orderly arrangement is located on a wooden surface, suggesting the presence of a shelf or a tabletop, which helps organize the bricks in a precise pattern.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates LEGO bricks which indeed display the studs typical of LEGO pieces. These protruding elements are visible on top of the bricks and are fundamental to LEGO construction, representing the ability to interlock with other bricks.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is depicted as being minimalistic and uniform, without any distraction or clutter. The background is a simple gradient without detailed imagery that could detract from the focus on the LEGO bricks, enhancing the minimalist approach.",
