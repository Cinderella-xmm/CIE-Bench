    "Question": "Q1: Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and banana are positioned close to each other, but they are not merged or combined to form a single unified form. The dog stands beside the banana, maintaining distinct characteristics and the separation between the two objects is clear, which indicates they do not form a single object. This reasoning is derived from the observation of their individual shapes and boundaries.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, neither the dog nor the banana shows signs of blending to create a single entity, hence there is no 'blended form' to assess for realism. The objects remain distinct, and Image B reflects a realistic depiction of each without signs of manipulation, such as unnatural edges or discrepancies in textures. Based on visual cues, both objects appear naturally distinct.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a distinct separation between the dog and the banana. As they are two separate objects with no merging or transitioning between them, the question of smoothness and seamlessness in blending is not applicable. They are positioned closely but not combined, so there are no transitions to evaluate.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
    "explanation": "The dog in Image B is shown beside a large banana, with proportions that suggest the banana is unusually large compared to the chihuahua. Given typical sizes of these objects, this scale is unrealistic because bananas don't usually exceed the size of this breed of dog. The image does not depict a blended form; hence there's a mismatch in proportions indicating an unrealistic scale.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on both the dog and banana appears consistent with each other and the surrounding grass environment, reflecting typical outdoor lighting conditions. There is no blended form to refer to, but individually both objects appear realistically lit with no disconnect in shadows or lighting discrepancies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
