      "question": "Is the car and coastal road enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible edges and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the car and road are clearly enclosed within a transparent rectangular display case. The edges of the case are visible, and there are reflections on the glass, which can be inferred from the clarity and reflections visible on the case edges. This is a typical feature of glass display cases.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car exhibit metallic red coloring with visible gradient hues across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car undoubtedly displays a metallic red color, characterized by gradient hues that reflect light across its surface. This metallic finish is common in sports cars to give them a vivid and dynamic appearance, emphasized by the gradient that suggests highlight and shading due to lighting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic curves and sharp detail lines present on the car’s bodywork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B, the car's design features dynamic curves and sharp detail lines which are characteristic of high-performance sports car designs. These lines and curves create a sense of speed and aerodynamics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the road and cliffs appear to be constructed from layered resin, showing visible stratification and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road and cliffs do appear to have a layered, stratified look, characteristic of resin model designs. This layered appearance suggests construction using resin, portraying depth and dimensionality.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are micro gravel textures visibly embedded in the road and cliff surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any micro gravel textures embedded in the road or cliff surfaces. Instead, the surfaces appear smooth and more akin to a polished or painted model surface without any visible texture indicative of gravel.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a sunset sky panel placed at the top of the display case, forming part of the diorama’s upper boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top boundary of Image B's display case shows a sky panel with sunset colors, indicating that it forms part of the diorama's visual enclosure. This sunset panel contributes to the overall aesthetic of the diorama, simulating an outdoor environment within the enclosed space.",
