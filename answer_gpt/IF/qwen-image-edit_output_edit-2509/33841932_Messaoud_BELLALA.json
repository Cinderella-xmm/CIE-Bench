      "question": "Are there exactly four distinct bookmark-shaped objects in the edited image, each resembling one of the skyscrapers from the original cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are precisely four bookmark-shaped objects placed on a notebook page. Each bookmark has a unique design that mirrors the architectural features observed in the skyscrapers seen in Image A. Visual cues and common knowledge allow us to understand these bookmarks are styled to appear like miniature versions of these buildings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the four bookmarks exhibit a metallic sheen and are they primarily colored in shimmering gold and silver hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases four bookmarks that are visually striking due to their metallic appearance. They are distinctly colored; two bookmarks are shimmering gold, while the other two are in a silver hue. This information is derived from their reflective surfaces and specific color tones, which are characteristic of metallic objects.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bookmarks have clearly etched, lively, and stylized outlines that give them a cartoon-like appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmarks in Image B feature stylized and exaggerated outlines, with distinctive, lively detailing giving them a cartoon-like aesthetic. The etchings are simplified and bold, akin to illustrations found in animated content. This stylization is evident from their prominent linear patterns and playful design elements.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there an open book in the image with the four bookmarks clipped onto its pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four bookmarks are placed on top of a notebook rather than clipped onto pages. The visible binding and lined paper suggest it is a notebook, not an open book with bookmarks clipped onto it. This allows us to deduce from visual observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains doodles on the notebook page. These include hand-drawn stars scattered above the bookmarks and wavy lines below them, resembling water. These illustrations are clearly visible, thanks to the contrast they present against the notebookâ€™s page color.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmarks in Image B each resemble a different skyscraper silhouette from Image A. We observe specific unique features and stylized outlines in each bookmark that correspond directly to the unique shapes and designs of the skyscrapers in the original cityscape, reflecting their architectural identity in a condensed form.",
