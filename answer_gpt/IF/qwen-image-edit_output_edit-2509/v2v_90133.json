      "question": "Has the smaller NXP electronic module been transformed into a metallic, multifaceted eye cluster?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller NXP electronic module from Image A is not visible in its original form. Instead, there is a prominent feature resembling a metallic eye with a multifaceted appearance in its place. This suggests a transformation from the original module into a metallic eye-like structure.",

      "question": "Has the larger green circuit board been transformed into a chitinous body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows what appears to be a cyborg beetle, and the circuit board from Image A has been integrated into its body. The beetle's body exhibits a shiny, chitin-like quality that resembles insect exoskeletons. This indicates a transformation from the original green circuit board to a chitinous-like appearance combined into the beetle's form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the solder points on the green board been converted into bioluminescent spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of what used to be solder points on the circuit board from Image A now look like glowing spots. These spots are similar to bioluminescent features seen in some biological and artificial designs, suggesting a transformation to bioluminescent spots in the context of the cyborg beetle.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the traces on the green board been evolved into delicate, glowing wing veins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beetle-like creature has wings with glowing lines that resemble wing veins. These lines originate from the position of the circuit traces on the green board in Image A, suggesting they have been transformed into the intricate, glowing veins of the beetle's wings.",

      "question": "Is the cyborg beetle poised on the existing neutral background without altering it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to remain the same neutral color as in Image A, without any noticeable changes. The addition of the cyborg beetle does not alter the background itself; hence, it is poised on the existing neutral background.",
