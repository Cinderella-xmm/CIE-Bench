      "question": "Does the edited image display a visual texture consistent with satin paper, including a soft sheen and slight reflectivity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image contains elements that appear on what could be described as premium materials. The paper on which the drawing is illustrated, given its context and ornate design, might suggest a texture like satin paper. Satin paper often provides a smooth finish with a slight sheen that reflects light subtly, contributing to an elegant appearance. However, there is no overt evidence of reflection or sheen directly observable to confirm this conclusively. Thus, without clear visibility of sheen or reflectivity, it's less likely to be consistent with satin paper.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the suit rendered with visible watercolor effects, showing blended blue-black hues and soft, painterly edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the suit in the illustration has heavy blending and gradient transitions, typical of watercolor techniques. The hues of blue and black mix softly, ensuring the transition between colors appears painterly. Watercolor effects are characterized by these blended tones and soft edges, rather than sharp lines, which is evident in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible golden pinstripes running vertically along the suit jacket, consistent with the watercolor aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the suit features vertical lines that appear to be golden pinstripes. These pinstripes are integrated into the watercolor-style suit design, which gives them a seamless appearance with the rest of the suit's aesthetic. The presence of golden pinstripes is clear and consistent with the watercolor rendering observed in the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there at least two different tie patterns visible across the images in the series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the series of edited images, the two small images depict different tie patterns. One tie has a textured pattern, while the other shows a distinct, separate design. The variations in patterns on the ties across the different illustrations confirm the presence of at least two different tie patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the image presented within a leather-bound album frame featuring an embossed title, with visible texture and depth suggesting real leather and raised lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a book-like item to the right that appears to be leather-bound. The cover has features that resemble the texture and stitching of leather, providing depth and the suggestion of real leather. Additionally, the area meant for a title does not explicitly show raised lettering but is nonetheless designed in a way that aligns with an embossed title's expected presentation. The overall appearance supports the inference of leather material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit rich textures (such as satin, leather, or watercolor brushwork) and a refined, timeless composition that conveys classic elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image indeed showcases multiple rich textures: the suit with watercolor effects, the leather-bound book, and the classic design of the illustration layout all contribute to a refined and timeless aesthetic. The combination of these elements leads to an overall composition that exudes classic elegance.",
