      "question": "Does the edited image display visible, textured brushstrokes across the entire composition, consistent with Impressionist painting techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible, textured brushstrokes throughout the image, which are hallmark features of Impressionist painting techniques. The strokes give a sense of movement and dynamism to the entire image. The application of paint in discernible, thick strokes also characterizes the style seen here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the scene lit with warm, golden-hour lighting suggestive of dusk, with soft shadows and a glowing horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a strong use of warm yellows and oranges throughout, which are characteristic of golden-hour lighting. The horizon glows with these warm tones, suggesting a time of day near dusk or dawn. This kind of lighting casts soft shadows and imbues the scene with a warm atmosphere.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the patterns and colors of the subject’s clothing rendered with thick, visible brushstrokes that exaggerate their vibrancy and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject’s clothing is depicted with thick, visible brushstrokes, which amplify the vibrancy and texture of the patterns and colors. This artistic choice highlights the boldness of the attire and adds a dynamic quality to its presentation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of soft, blended warm golden hues with no distinct details, creating a hazy, atmospheric effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is not devoid of distinct details; rather, it features elements such as trees using clear, visible brushstrokes. The hues are indeed warm and golden, but the presence of detailed elements conflicts with the idea of a hazy, indistinct background.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drum surface in Image B uses brushstrokes that add texture and depth, giving it the appearance of being more three-dimensional and tactile. These painting techniques create a sense of volume and realism when viewed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass and trees are depicted with artistic brushstrokes that create flowing and somewhat angular forms. These shapes contribute to a visual rhythm that complements the depicted activity of drumming, reinforcing the movement and energy within the scene.",
