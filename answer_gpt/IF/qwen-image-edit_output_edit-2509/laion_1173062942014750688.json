    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues present a serpent-shaped sculpture where the body flows continuously in loops, suggesting a singular entity. Unlike scattered, individual beads seen in Image A, the beads in Image B seem part of the serpent, giving an impression of a single, unified body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent-shaped body is adorned with intricate red and yellow patterns that resemble scales, akin to how patterns might mimic reptilian skin in depictions of snakes. The arrangement of colors and shapes evokes the texture typically attributed to scale-like designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the serpent have two blue circular features positioned as eyes at its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the head region of the serpent from Image B, there are clear blue circular features that are positioned symmetrically, suggestive of eyes on the serpent's head. These features are distinctly placed and colored, making them appear as the creature’s eyes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black motifs arranged as detailed, tribal-style patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black motifs on Image B's serpent are intricately interwoven with other colors and reminiscent of tribal patterns. They add depth and a stylized aesthetic to the serpent's surface, supporting the idea of cultural and artistic influences in the design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s tail extend into a long, thin, flowing form with small, dangling bead-like tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent’s tail in Image B transitions into a thin extension that culminates in hanging bead-like elements. The tail's structure suggests flexibility and fluidity with a gradual thinning leading to bead features, which droop as would be expected from dangling elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the sculpture of the serpent from Image B, the colors used remain within the palette of red, yellow, blue, and black. These colors are consistent with Image A's hues, indicative of a theme without the addition of unrelated colors.",
