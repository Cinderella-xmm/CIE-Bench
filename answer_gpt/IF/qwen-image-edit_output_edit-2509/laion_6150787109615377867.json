      "question": "Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a tabletop with a gear-like structure. The shape of the top includes visible teeth, consistent with the design of mechanical gears. Additionally, there are intricate engravings covering the surface, which matches the description of a gear-shaped component with detailed designs. This transformation is typical of steampunk aesthetics, where mechanical elements are enhanced with ornate patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the table legs been morphed into articulated, piston-driven limbs with visible joints and brass or copper-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the table supports as articulated limbs, which include visible joints and appear to be piston-driven. The colors are predominantly brass or copper, aligning with common steampunk designs that favor these metallic hues to represent industrial themes. The transformation from simple legs to complex limbs emphasizes mechanical functionality and aesthetic details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible steam vents placed along the central column of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central column is characterized by coils and tubes which can be interpreted as steam vents common in steampunk designs. Though steam is not visibly escaping, the presence of tubes suggests functionality related to steam or pneumatic activity, which is typical in steampunk adaptations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the base feature intricate cog patterns and at least one rotating dial or gauge element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the base of the table in Image B, there are visible cog patterns, highly detailed as in clockwork mechanisms. Additionally, multiple dial or gauge elements are present, giving the impression of a functional machine. These features enhance the steampunk transformation, which often includes visible mechanical outputs or measurements through gauges and dials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts what appears to be a steampunk-style mechanized table with features resembling a living machine. The design is cohesive, integrating elements like gears, pistons, and gauges that mimic the structure of a mechanical organism. The overall aesthetic is consistent with steampunk themes, where everyday objects are reimagined as fantastical machines.",
