      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the scene consists of a realistic model of an elephant and a backpack, both encased in a glass display box. There are no LEGO-style minifigures present or any elements resembling LEGO figurines. The objects appear to be realistic replicas rather than stylized toy versions or figures.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elephant and backpack are clearly placed within a transparent display case, which appears to be a glass or acrylic cube.
