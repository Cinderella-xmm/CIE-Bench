      "question": "Is the facade of the theater building constructed from visible tan LEGO bricks with brown accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the theater building is constructed using tan LEGO bricks as the main color, evident from the block-like appearance and construction typical of LEGO structures. The accents on the facade, such as the ornamental details and roof trim, are distinctly brown, typical for LEGO-themed models. The decision to use tan as the base and brown for accents helps to differentiate structural and ornamental elements, making them not only realistic but also playful. This understanding comes from recognizing the common use of LEGO bricks in set designs, where colors are used to mimic real-world textures and styles.",

      "question": "Are the large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO pieces arranged in a grid pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents large arched windows with a distinctive translucent square pattern. Each window consists of a grid formed by LEGO pieces, which are translucent and designed to resemble glass in a playful, simplified manner consistent with LEGO construction methods. These windows are recreated using typical LEGO aesthetics, relying on the square shape of the original LEGO elements to construct a realistic yet whimsical representation of what would be seen in such a theater structure. This reliance on common LEGO patterns facilitates the creation of recognizable yet creatively interpreted architectural features.",

      "question": "Are the marquee signs for \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" rendered using smooth red flat LEGO bricks to form the letters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marquee signs are constructed using smooth red flat LEGO bricks over what would typically be expected for such lettering. However, upon visual analysis, the signs appear less clear in terms of letter formation, instead concentrating more on the surrounding structure crafted with LEGO bricks. Thus, it suggests that while red components are visibly part of the signage structure, they do not directly render letters formed of individual bricks. Understanding LEGO builds highlights that signage often embeds brick-based letters into larger structures, which is not present here.",

      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles, one in black and one in purple, with angular, modular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage cars are depicted as block-like LEGO models, consistent with LEGO design principles. The cars have angular, modular shapes typical of LEGO's toy aesthetics, rendering them functional-looking and stylistically simplified. The color scheme is maintained with one car in black and the other in purple, which corresponds with using the necessary LEGO colors to mimic realistic vehicle differentiation accurately. This preference for LEGO's modular construction style makes them identifiable, emphasizing toy-like proportions while retaining the character of the vintage vehicle concept.",

      "question": "Does the entire scene—including the building, cars, and signage—appear as a cohesive, playful, miniature LEGO model with consistent blocky textures and toy-like proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B comprehensively resembles a miniature LEGO model with every component—from building facade to vehicles and signage—aligned with LEGO's playful aesthetic and toy-like proportions. The entire scene is constructed using recognizable LEGO textures, all of which contribute to a cohesive, blocky model. This analysis stems from understanding LEGO's characteristic design principles, where unified textures create a consistent visual language and proportions reflect those typical in toy modeling. The overall appearance harmoniously balances realistic detail with LEGO's structural simplicity, yielding a toy-like scene.",
