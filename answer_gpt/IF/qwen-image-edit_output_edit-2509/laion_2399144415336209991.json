        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bride's gown features a series of beadwork that appears more detailed and prominent. The cartoon style often embellishes details to make them stand out, hence the artwork gives the beadwork a more elaborate appearance than in a realistic photo like Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are illustrations showing different interactions between the couple: one with them embracing, another with the bride holding a champagne glass indicating a toasting scene, and one with them holding each other suggesting a dancing scene. Thus, there are at least representations of these actions, even if not completely distinct in number.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, every scene is enclosed within a heart-shaped frame, bordered with a golden trim. This decorative choice gives each scene a distinct separation with a consistent thematic presentation, reinforcing the idea of love and unity.",
