      "question": "Does the illustration include a full-body depiction of the creature that incorporates elements like scissors, rulers, or pens?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a full-body depiction of a creature, but it does not feature those specific elements directly integrated into the creature's design. Although its intricate patterns may suggest the theme of craft or precision, no direct elements like scissors, rulers, or pens are visibly part of its bodily design. Common sense and world knowledge would suggest that these crafting tools typically have distinct appearances and would be easily identifiable if present.",
