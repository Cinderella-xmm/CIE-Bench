    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B shows that the entire object is composed of stacked rectangular, block-like structures typical of LEGO bricks. These visible seams and interlocking formations are characteristic of LEGO-style assembly, which suggests a construction method fully relying on these blocks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, distinct blocky patterns of black, gray, and white are observable, aligning with how LEGO bricks can mimic patterns by arranging different colored bricks. This correspondence suggests that the original sock patterns are successfully represented in the bricky sculpture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a three-dimensional object constructed from multiple layers of bricks, achieving depth through stacked rows and columns of varying heights. The visible layers and their varying sizes contribute to the overall depth, confirming a layered three-dimensional appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a small, distinct orange element protruding from the top of the sock. Its appearance is consistent with a singular LEGO brick, evidenced by its blocky structure and contrast against the rest of the black sock design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the sculpture set on a plain, white platform in an unembellished environment. This context, with its absence of unnecessary visual noise, aligns with standard gallery settings which emphasize the artwork by reducing clutter.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of bricks in Image B reveals a meticulously ordered structure with well-defined edges and a deliberate architectural style. The consistent alignment of brick rows and the structured form are indicative of precision in construction, common in architectural detailing.",
