        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, it is evident that there is a small figure positioned on top of the black dresser. The figure appears to be a detailed representation, commonly known as a collectible figure, which is obvious by its distinct and deliberate design, suggesting it is intended to be a collectible item.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure is placed on top of a black dresser, which is a stable and flat surface. Such surfaces are commonly used for placing small decorative items or collectibles to display them, making it suitable for a desk ornament.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure in Image B is distinct in style and color compared to the minimalist and cohesive decor of the room, including the black dresser, vase, and plant. While it doesn't necessarily clash severely, it does introduce a different visual element that may not blend seamlessly with the overall aesthetic, which leans towards a more understated and coordinated theme.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure, although placed on the dresser and in front of the mirror, does not physically block significant portions of the mirror or overshadow other decorative elements like the vase. It is relatively small in comparison to these other items.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the collectible figure appear seamlessly integrated into the scene as though it is a natural part of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure in Image B stands out due to its divergence in style and purpose from the rest of the decor. The scene is arranged with minimalist decor, and the figure introduces a thematic contrast. Its presence appears more as an addition rather than a naturally integrated part of the room's coherent aesthetic.",
