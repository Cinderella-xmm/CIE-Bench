      "question": "Do the book pages extend out of the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon observing the edges of the book, the pages do not extend beyond the visible boundaries of the image frame. The alignment and layout of the pages remain within the confines of the image's borders. Based on common photographic framing, objects extending out of the frame would show signs of incompleteness at the borders, which is not evident here.",

      "question": "Is there a subtle curved shadow on the extended pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, when analyzing the lighting and shadow effects on the pages, there is a gentle, curved shadow noticeable on the lower left side of the pages. Such shadows are typical when pages curve and are usually casted by the dimples or waves on paper under angled light sources. The visual cues show consistent behavior with how light interacts with curves or bends in paper.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the editing convey the impression that the book is unfolding toward the viewer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the way the pages appear to curve and spread resembles a motion or unfolding effect toward the viewer. This perception is created by the curvature of the pages along with the perspective, making it seem as if the book is opening wider in the viewer's direction, a typical portrayal in photography to highlight depth or dimensionality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the extended pages visually consistent with the original book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparison of Image A and Image B, the characteristics of the pages such as texture, color, and alignment remain consistent between original and edited pages. There are no distinct discrepancies in these attributes suggesting the extended pages differ from the original ones, maintaining visual integrity throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a seamless transition between the original and extended parts of the book pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes  \n```",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the visible original pages and any simulated extensions is smooth. The same color, lighting, and texture details are mirrored without any abrupt changes or disparities. This seamless transition allows the viewer to perceive continuity in the image without noticing the editing line.",
