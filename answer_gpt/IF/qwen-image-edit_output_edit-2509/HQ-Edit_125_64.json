      "question": "Has the Sphinx’s head been replaced with a radiant sun disc featuring visible hieroglyphic patterns?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a Sphinx with what appears to be a radiant sun disc in place of its head, characterized by its circular shape and prominent rays extending outward. The center of the disc contains hieroglyphic-like patterns, which suggest an ancient Egyptian symbolic motif. This transformation is evident without referring to Image A.",

      ],
