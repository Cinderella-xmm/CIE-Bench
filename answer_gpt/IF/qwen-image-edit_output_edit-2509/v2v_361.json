      "question": "Is there a person's hand visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there is a visible hand holding the keychain. This can be concluded from the presence of fingers and thumb wrapped around the top part of the keyring, a common way people hold small objects. Human anatomy indicates it is a typical grasping posture, confirming the presence of a hand.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain feature a chibi-style depiction of the dog from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain design shows a simplified, cartoonish version of a dog, commonly associated with chibi style, characterized by exaggerated and cute features like larger eyes and a proportionally smaller body. The dog resembles a Yorkshire Terrier similar to the dog in Image A, thus suggesting that the keychain represents the same breed with chibi elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the keychain made of soft rubber with thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual texture and design style depicted in Image B suggest the material is a soft rubber or similar polymer, as seen in its smooth surface and flexibility implied by its rounded edges. The thick black outlines are typical for such designs to define shapes in a cartoonish manner, reinforcing the conclusion about the material.",

      "question": "Is the keychain connected to a tiny silver keyring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual observation of Image B shows a keyring, which is metallic and reflective, characteristic of silver. Keyrings commonly have a circular shape with a connector that is clearly visible holding the chibi dog charm. Its size compared to the hand suggests it's a small keyring.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a single, solid color with no patterns or objects present, indicating neutrality and simplicity. This absence of extra elements is typical for product display images to avoid distractions and focus on the subject matter, which in this case is the keychain.",
