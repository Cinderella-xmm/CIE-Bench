      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "The surface of the creature in Image B has a texture similar to stone, with visible cracks and crevices.

      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no clear indications that the roots of the mountain have become limb-like structures that interact with the trees in the foreground. Instead, the focus is more on the transformation of the mountain into the creature's body and wings, not its integration with foreground objects.",
      "weight": 1,

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, there are visible vein-like structures on the creature’s body that appear to glow with hues of blue and pink. This feature adds a mystical and otherworldly quality to the creature, emphasizing its mythical nature.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
