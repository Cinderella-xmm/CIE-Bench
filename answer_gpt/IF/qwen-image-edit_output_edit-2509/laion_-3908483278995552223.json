      "question": "Is the Aquatic warrior rendered as a three-dimensional model rather than a flat 2D image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior is depicted with depth, shadows, and lighting that suggest a 3D form. The figure appears to be enclosed in glass, with a round base, indicating a 360-degree viewable model typical of 3D models or statuettes.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior enclosed within a dome that features marine-themed decorations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior is encased within a transparent dome. The base is decorated with elements resembling a sea floor, such as sandy textures and coral structures, reinforcing the marine theme.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the Aquatic warrior's armor is depicted with a metallic sheen in blue tones. The reflective highlights suggest a metal-like quality, typical in rendering 3D models to emphasize texture and material.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base on which the 3D model stands includes decorations mimicking a coral reef, with stylized coral patterns and shapes, suggesting an artificial or crafted representation of an oceanic environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there swirling, miniature water currents visible around the figure, suggesting dynamic movement?",
