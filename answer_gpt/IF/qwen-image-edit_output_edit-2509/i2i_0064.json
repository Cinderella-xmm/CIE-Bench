      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the cat is seen wearing glasses. This is an unusual and humorous addition since cats do not naturally wear glasses. By observing the spectacles on its face, which are not common for animals, it's evident that the image has been altered to give the cat this human-like accessory.",

      "question": "Is the cat lounging on a sofa in a human-like posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is positioned in a manner that suggests it is lounging on a sofa. Its body is reclined, and its front limbs are positioned in a relaxed manner. This posture mimics how a human might sit on a sofa, suggesting the image has been anthropomorphized to some extent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat holding a remote control while a TV appears in the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat has its paw resting on a remote control, suggesting it might be using it, which is an anthropomorphic touch. Additionally, a TV can be seen in the room, but the way the question is phrased referring to 'foreground' is misleading. Typically, 'foreground' implies it's directly in front of the main subject, but here, it means 'visible alongside'. By common understanding, the remote control placement suggests interaction with the TV.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the background been changed to depict a living room scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background prominently features elements typical of a living room, such as a TV, sofa, and ambient indoor lighting. The visual context strongly suggests a living room environment, contrasting from any outdoor or alternative setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cat retain its original fur pattern, posture, and bell collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat maintains its fur pattern, recognizable by the distinct stripes typical of a tabby cat. The original posture, while anthropomorphized in its context, remains physically plausible for a cat. The bell collar is visible around its neck, maintaining consistency in accessory from any presumed original image.",
