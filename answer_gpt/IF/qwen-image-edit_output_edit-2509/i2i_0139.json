    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the carrot now growing inside a space greenhouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is contained within a futuristic cylindrical chamber with clear walls, which is depicted to be situated in a space environment as indicated by the visible starry background. This strongly suggests a space greenhouse setting as it appears akin to conceptual designs for plant growth in extraterrestrial environments.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include a metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber surrounding the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual appearance of the chamber in Image B is metallic with a polished, high-tech design and is illuminated by rings of lights typically associated with climate control technologies. This is consistent with images of climate-controlled cultivation environments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carrot now rooted in synthetic substrate instead of natural soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a substrate that appears clean and uniform, characteristic of synthetic materials often used in controlled cultivation settings for consistency and sterility, as opposed to the varied texture of natural soil.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the carrot appear visibly rooted in the synthetic substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrot in Image B is shown firmly planted within the substrate, with a portion visibly embedded, which indicates it is rooted within the medium provided in the chamber.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has all evidence of the original outdoor garden environment been removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has completely replaced the outdoor garden backdrop from Image A with a sealed, futuristic space setting devoid of any natural outdoor elements. The absence of any natural landscape implies that all traces of the original environment have been removed.",
