      "question": "Has a small flag reading “Fresh” been added on top of the sandwich?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable small flag which is not present in Image A. This flag, placed on top of the sandwich, reads 'Fresh'. The presence of this element is a clear addition when compared to Image A, where no such flag is evident. The flag is easily identifiable due to its contrasting position and text, standing out as a distinguishing feature in Image B.",

      "question": "Have the tomato slices been replaced with grilled pineapple slices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows slices of grilled pineapple on the sandwich, which differ significantly from the tomato slices seen in Image A. The pineapple slices in Image B can be recognized by their distinct yellow color and ring shape, while the tomato slices in Image A are a red color and have a different texture and shape. This substitution is evident when directly comparing both images.",

      "question": "Are the layers of lettuce and meat unchanged except for the addition of the flag and substitution of the tomato?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layers of lettuce and meat in Image B appear the same as in Image A, maintaining the same structure and composition. Other than the replacement of tomato slices with grilled pineapple slices and the addition of the 'Fresh' flag, there are no visible alterations to the lettuce and meat layers in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the pineapple slices appear grilled, showing char marks or a browned exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pineapple slices do indeed show signs of grilling, as evidenced by the visible char marks and browned areas on their surface. This grilling effect provides texture and visual contrast, which confirms their preparation method, unlike the tomato slices in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the flag sit properly on top of the sandwich without disrupting its composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flag added to Image B is positioned neatly on top of the sandwich without causing any noticeable disturbance to its overall composition. It stands vertically and is not interfering with the structural integrity of the sandwich layers or appearance. This placement allows the sandwich to retain its presentational appeal while conveying the freshness message.",
