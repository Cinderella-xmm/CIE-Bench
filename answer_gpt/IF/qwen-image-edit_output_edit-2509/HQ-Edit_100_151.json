      "question": "Is the child depicted with exaggerated cartoon-style features such as large eyes, oversized head, or stylized expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's features, apart from the blurred face, do not show exaggerated cartoon-style characteristics. The proportions of the body, coat, and surroundings all suggest a more realistic depiction instead of an exaggerated cartoon style. Typical cartoon characteristics would include larger eyes or an oversized head, which are not evident here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the coat and balloons rendered in pastel colors (soft, desaturated hues) rather than vibrant or saturated tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the balloons are rendered in pastel colors like lavender, soft pink, and pale green. Similarly, the child's coat is a soft yellow, aligned with pastel tones. These hues are typical of pastel colors, which are softer and less saturated compared to vibrant colors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the wheat field exhibit visible watercolor textures such as soft edges, blended colors, or brushstroke patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheat field appears smooth and digitally illustrated rather than having watercolor textures. There are no visible brushstrokes or blended color gradients typical of watercolor art. The edges are crisp and clean, further supporting a non-watercolor rendering.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a calendar grid displayed below the child, appearing as if it is hanging or attached to the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct calendar grid displayed beneath the child, clearly separated from the landscape. It appears as an integral part of the image, but not as if it's hanging or physically attached to the scene, rather it is part of the overall composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the balloons visually associated with individual days in the calendar grid, such that each balloon corresponds to a single day?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar grid does indeed have colored balloons associated with specific days. This suggests each balloon marks a particular day, with these visual markers aligned with the calendar dates below.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is rendered in a soft, light blue hue. This color choice aligns with creating a gentle, serene atmosphere, often associated with clear skies during pleasant weather conditions and seasonal transitions.",
