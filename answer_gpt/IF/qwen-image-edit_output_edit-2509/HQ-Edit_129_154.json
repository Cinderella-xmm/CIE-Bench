      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the object is visually identifiable as an owl. Its distinctive features include an owl-shaped body, mechanical feathers, and a head adorned with a crown, which contrasts the original teapot form in Image A with its spout, lid, and handle. This transformation clearly results in a shift from a teapot to an owl, as evident from the owl’s recognizable anatomy and posture.",

      "question": "Does the lid of the original teapot form the crown-like head of the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the owl with a crown atop its head. In Image A, the teapot lid has a prominent, ornate design; this element is transformed into the crown in the owl's representation, maintaining the teapot's original elaborate pattern while adding features characteristic of a crown.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original engravings now transformed into metallic feather-like patterns covering the owl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl displays feather-like patterns with intricate metallic designs, similar to the detailed engravings seen on Image A’s teapot. These engravings have been adapted into a texture and style that mimic feathers, exhibiting the same artistic intricacy while fitting the owl’s anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been reshaped into a sharp, mechanical beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B showcases an owl with a mechanical beak. Image A features a teapot spout with a sleek curve, which has been repurposed and reshaped in Image B to become the pointed beak seen on the owl, conforming to the transformation of parts from the original to the edited image.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a gracefully curved tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl features a tail that curves gracefully. The teapot in Image A has a handle with ornate curls, and in Image B, this handle’s curve and design have been reinterpreted as the owl’s tail, showcasing a transformation that integrates the handle’s form into the owl’s anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two glowing eyes made of cogs visible on the owl's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly illustrates the owl with two glowing eyes that appear to have cog-like designs embedded in them. This mechanical appearance aligns with the transformation of the teapot's engraved motifs into detailed, industrial elements in the owl representation, emphasizing a mechanical theme.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned on a richly carved wooden branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the owl perched on a branch characterized by intricate carvings, presenting a realistic wooden texture. This aspect is part of the new composition in Image B, aiming to integrate the owl with a naturalistic yet artistic environment, a divergence from Image A which features no such setting.",
