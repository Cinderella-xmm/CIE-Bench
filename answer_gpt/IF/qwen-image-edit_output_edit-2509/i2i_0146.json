      "question": "Have the zebraâ€™s characteristic black-and-white stripes been retained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a zebra-like figure with black-and-white stripes on its body, clearly resembling the typical pattern seen on real zebras. This pattern is recognizable due to its alternating black and white horizontal stripes. Such a characteristic is crucial for zebras and is retained in the edited stylized version. The distinct contrast and arrangement are still observed in the cartoon representation. Therefore, the stripes are undoubtedly retained.",

      "question": "Are the ears of the zebra in an upright position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are depicted in a standing, erect position, pointing slightly forward. This posture is typical for zebras and is a sign of alertness or attentiveness. Given the cartoonish representation, the ears still maintain this upright position as part of the stylized design. Thus, visually interpreting the ears, they are upright.",
