    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the Brooklyn Bridge been transformed into a colossal, humanoid stone golem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a massive stone figure with humanoid features dominating the skyline, resembling a mythical golem. The presence of humanoid characteristics suggests that the iconic Brooklyn Bridge imagery has been edited to appear as part of this large golem figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the twin spires of the Brooklyn Bridge been reshaped into arms extending from the golem's shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem has distinct arms extending from its shoulders, and these do not appear to possess elements directly deriving from the bridge's spires, such as cable tendons. Instead, the bridge itself remains untransformed separately alongside the golem. The structural elements in image B depict the spires of the bridge rather than becoming arms of the golem.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bridge's cables depicted as sinewy tendons wrapped around the golem’s broad chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual detail in Image B shows the bridge's cables and ropes elaborately interwoven as sinewy tendons across the torso of the golem, supporting the notion that the bridge's cables have been reshaped to form part of the golem's design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the Freedom Tower been transformed into a tall, crystalline crown positioned on the golem's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a tall, crystalline structure atop the golem, reminiscent of a crown with a radiating design. This differs from the Freedom Tower's architectural style, indicating that edits transformed the Tower into the crown on the golem's head.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the surrounding skyscrapers been transformed into intricate armor plating covering parts of the golem’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows skyscrapers in their original form in the background behind the golem, suggesting they have not been converted into armor pieces for the golem. The buildings remain as scenery alongside the golem but do not decorate its framework.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the golem stand in a majestic, upright, and firmly anchored stance, dominating the cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golem in Image B is depicted in an upright and firm stance, towering above the cityscape and exhibiting an imposing presence. This positioning aligns with a majestic figure, which dominates the scene, illustrating a powerful stance.",
