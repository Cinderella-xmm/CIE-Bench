    "Question": "Q1: Have both individuals been transformed into a chibi-style 3D model?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals appear simplified with features such as larger heads and smaller bodies, typical of a chibi-style representation. The design choices, such as exaggerated proportions and smooth, cartoon-like textures, indicate a chibi-style transformation. This contrasts with Image A, where the individuals have more natural human proportions and textures.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the person in front still wearing a formal suit and holding a cup in the chibi-style 3D model?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the chibi-style transformation, the person in front retains the attributes of wearing a formal suit and holding a cup. This continuity suggests an effort to maintain key identifying features from the original image, where the individual was similarly dressed and posed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the person in the back positioned near a gently glowing lamp resting on a table in the chibi-style 3D model?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person in the background remains positioned near a lamp on a table, which is softly glowing. This scene element is preserved from Image A, where the lamp was already present on a table beside the individual, adding to the ambient lighting.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the scene maintain a photorealistic vibe with warm lighting throughout?",
    "explanation": "Image B, with its chibi-style transformation, moves away from photorealism, exhibiting a more stylized and artificial appearance. The lighting is still warm, but the overall visual style is not photorealistic due to the cartoon-like features.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire composition enclosed within a photo frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate that the entire composition is presented as if it is within a bordered frame, suggesting the appearance of a photo frame.
