        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the character exhibits a chibi-style representation, which typically includes exaggerated features such as large heads and smaller bodies. Due to the design style, the character does not retain the original facial details from Image A as these are often simplified or stylized in chibi art. The pose - hand in pocket and holding a book/tablet - is similar but adapted to the chibi proportions, suggesting the pose is retained but not the facial details.",
