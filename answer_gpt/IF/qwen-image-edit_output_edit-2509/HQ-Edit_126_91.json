      "question": "Has the grand piano been reimagined as a luxury cosmetics product display, clearly shifting its purpose from musical instrument to cosmetic packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano has been transformed into a cosmetic product display. Its lid is opened to reveal makeup items, including palettes of colorful cosmetics, resembling eyeshadow or blush palettes. This arrangement alters the purpose of the piano from a musical instrument to a unique packaging for cosmetics. The common knowledge that cosmetics are often displayed in luxurious and organized palettes supports this conclusion.",

      "question": "Has the piano lid been transformed into a compact mirror case with a reflective surface and a design consistent with a high-end makeup compact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanism typically supporting the piano lid now supports what appears to be a compact mirror. This surface is reflective, as expected from a mirror, and is integrated into a design that suggests a makeup compact. Considering high-end makeup compacts commonly feature a mirror for convenience, the visual cues combined with this knowledge clearly show the transformation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts all visible surfaces of the newly reimagined piano, such as the body and lid, with a glossy black finish.

      "question": "Is the product positioned within an elegant hall featuring marble columns and flooring, creating a luxurious and sophisticated backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The environment in Image B reveals an elegant space, yet the flooring material now appears to be marble or marble-like, contributing to the luxurious ambiance. In Image A, the flooring was more plain, making the transformation in the environment evident. The setup enhances the sophistication, typically seen in high-end displays or showrooms, and is consistent with settings for luxury products.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the piano-shaped product includes a visible logo with 'Luxury Camer' text. This branding is refined and prominently displayed, contributing significantly to the product's exclusivity and brand identity, commonly associated with high-end items. In Image A, such branding is absent, further confirming the transformation focused on branding.",
