      "question": "Is the Funko Pop-style box shown in an isometric view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An isometric view typically shows multiple sides of an object, presenting the width, height, and depth in the same scale, giving it a three-dimensional appearance. In Image B, the box is viewed slightly from the side, with both the front and part of the side visible, which creates an isometric perception. Therefore, based on the visual presentation, the box does have an isometric view.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure of the baseball player hold a bat and wear a helmet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the chibi-style figure, resembling a typical baseball player, is holding a bat, indicated by the position of the bat in its hand. Additionally, the figure is wearing a helmet, visible on its head. These elements are consistent with portraying a baseball player in a chibi style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are a ball and glove included as signature elements accompanying the chibi-style figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is shown to have a glove on one hand, which is a signature element for a baseball player. While the glove is included, the image does not depict a ball with the figure outside of the box, only visible on the box illustration. Thus, based on the visual analysis, a glove is included but not a ball, as a physical element with the figure itself.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a realistic depiction of the figure positioned outside of the box with detailed textures and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a chibi-style figure placed outside the box. The figure displays detailed textures and lighting, evident in the sheen on the helmet and the intricate design of the uniform. The use of lighting enhances the realistic portrayal of this simplistic and stylized character, contrasting with two-dimensional illustrations typically found only on the box.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the front of the packaging in Image B, the title 'BASEBALL LEGEND' is prominently displayed. It denotes the theme of the character, reinforcing its association with baseball. This visual indicator directly conveys the product's branding as referenced in the image.",
