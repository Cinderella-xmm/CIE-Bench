      "question": "Is the motorcycle composed entirely of black and blue LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues in Image B, the motorcycle appears to be primarily made of black and blue LEGO-style bricks. The dominant colors visible are black and blue, consistent with the color scheme of the motorcycle design. This observation fits the notion that LEGO models are typically composed of bricks representing colors seen in real-life objects. Hence, the answer is determined by evaluating the colored bricks within the image.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the angular design features of the original motorcycle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model displays sharp angular design features, similar to the original motorcycle's angular aesthetic, visible through the sharp angles of the fairing and body panels. This observation is based on the notion that LEGO models often replicate real-life objects while maintaining their angular and block-like style. By recognizing these sharp contours, we deduce the angular design features have been retained.",

      "question": "Are the wheel rims replaced with intricate cog patterns typical of LEGO mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the wheel rims having intricate cog-like patterns, evident from their detailed mechanical appearance. Such designs are typical in LEGO constructions, as they often utilize cog-like components for wheels. Hence, the observation of these patterns leads to the conclusion that the rims have been replaced with LEGO-style cog patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original decals represented as colorful printed tiles on the LEGO model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model has colorful tiles with printed elements, positioned on areas like the sides, reminiscent of decals seen on the original motorcycle. This is evident through the presence of LEGO bricks printed with motifs emulating the decals in Image A. This observation aligns with the common practice in LEGO models where decals or graphics are often represented by printed tiles.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model placed on a smooth gray baseplate with directional arrows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B reveals the LEGO model is indeed seated on a smooth gray baseplate. The directional arrows are visibly printed on the base, indicating placement guidance, a typical representation in LEGO kits for display or orientation. This conclusion stems from observing these printed gray elements beneath the motorcycle model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the blue and black stripes follow the same dynamic flow and positioning as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indicates that while the colors blue and black are present, the stripe patterns deviate slightly in flow and position compared to the original vehicle's design. The LEGO construction alters certain flow dynamics while trying to maintain color matching. In this LEGO interpretation, the subtle differences in stripe flow due to brick limitations lead us to conclude they don't follow the exact positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model displayed within a clean, enclosed display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates that the LEGO model is indeed encased within a clean, transparent display case. The case's walls and clean presentation are visible in the image, clearly enclosing the motorcycle and presenting it as a display piece, matching common practices for showcasing LEGO models in enclosed spaces.",
