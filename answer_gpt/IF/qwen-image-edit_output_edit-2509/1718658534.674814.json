      "question": "Is the figurine made of a glossy, smooth ceramic material instead of knitted yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine clearly displays a glossy, smooth surface typical of ceramic materials. This is indicated by the reflective, shiny appearance which is a common characteristic of ceramics when finished and polished. My conclusion is based on recognizing these visual cues and associating them with material properties of ceramic. In contrast, knitted yarn would show a textured surface with yarn fibers visible, which is not what is seen in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the figurine exhibits a vibrant terracotta tone, characterized by a rich reddish-brown color. This is a common color for earthenware ceramics, often seen in traditional pottery. My reasoning is based on recognizing the hue which aligns with the description of terracotta, a universally acknowledged color in ceramics.",

      "question": "Are there visible intricate floral engravings on the surface of the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the figurine is adorned with detailed floral engravings. These designs are visible and ornate, suggesting a crafting process involving molding or engraving typical in ceramic art. The reasoning involves identifying these patterns as a form of decorative engraving commonly seen on ceramics, which is absent in those made from yarn.",

      "question": "Do the eyes resemble small polished amber stones in color, texture, and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the eyes of the figurine exhibit a warm amber color with a glossy finish. This appearance aligns with polished amber stones, known for their smooth, reflective qualities and distinct coloring. My reasoning stems from associating the visual characteristics of the figurine's eyes with those of amber stones, and distinguishing these from other potential materials or colors.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting consists of a plain wooden surface and a neutral, minimalist grey background. This gives a clean and uncluttered look, illustrating simplicity in the setting which is often used to highlight the subject without distractions. The reasoning involves recognizing typical visual cues of wood grain and texture, paired with a sparse background style.",
