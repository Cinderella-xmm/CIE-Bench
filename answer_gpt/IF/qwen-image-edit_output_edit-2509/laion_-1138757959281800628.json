    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire hotel and pool scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hotel and pool scene is clearly depicted inside a transparent glass box or terrarium structure, which constitutes that setup. World knowledge about terrariums suggests enclosed environments that can feature landscapes, which matches the scenario here.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the pool display layered water effects, such as visible depth layers or textured surface ripples?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pool in Image B appears to have a visible division between the underwater and above-water sections. There are textured surface ripples at the water's edge, suggesting layered water effects. Knowledge of water dynamics in containers assists in understanding these representations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sunbathers and surrounding trees visibly miniaturized in size relative to the building and pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunbathers and trees are significantly smaller compared to the building and the pool, indicating a miniature representation often found in dioramas or model setups. This depiction contrasts with typical real-life proportions, where people and trees would be relatively larger compared to the infrastructure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there fabricated cascading greenery visibly growing from the rooftop of the hotel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows cascading greenery descending from the rooftop edges of the hotel in a style that appears artificial and fabricated, unlike natural growth patterns. The interior design often incorporates such features for aesthetic purposes, which resonates with the terrarium concept.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are small, whimsical beach accessories (e.g., toy floats, tiny buckets, or miniature umbrellas) placed near the edge of the pool?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes playful miniature objects near the poolside, such as toy floats and small-scale beach accessories, which are indicative of dioramas or decorative setups, creating a whimsical atmosphere. These objects contribute to the overall theme of a miniature world.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there floating 3D cloud elements positioned above the scene, distinct from the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cloud elements are visible and appear to be positioned above the contained hotel scene, separate from any realistic sky background, suggesting a stylized or artificial representation. Such features are common in diorama settings to enhance visual appeal.",
