    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there exactly three distinct postcards visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are three individual postcards present. Each postcard features a version of the original image, with differing artistic enhancements or color schemes. By visually examining Image B, it is evident that there are exactly three separate and distinct postcards visible in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is one of the postcards rendered with a blue gradient that emphasizes the embroidered dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "One postcard in the edited image is depicted with a blue gradient effect. This effect envelops the entire card, accentuating the intricate embroidery on the dress. The blue gradient provides a stark background that makes the dress's details more prominent, indicating that the blue gradient is used to emphasize the embroidered dress.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is one of the postcards rendered in silver tones, specifically emphasizing the hair accessory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Among the postcards in the edited image, one is rendered in silver tones. This color scheme is very suitable for highlighting metallic or reflective surfaces, such as the hair accessory in the image. By using silver tones, this postcard effectively emphasizes the hair accessory against the background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does one of the postcards incorporate stylized bamboo patterns as a dominant visual element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a distinct object featuring a stylized bamboo pattern. However, this is not on a postcard but rather on a separate item, which appears to be a book cover with an embroidery-inspired design. This item showcases stylized bamboo prominently, but since it's not a postcard, the question's requirements aren't met.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire set of postcards presented within a silk-bound book whose cover features an embroidery-inspired design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no evidence of the postcards being contained within a silk-bound book. Although a book is present, featuring an embroidery-inspired design with bamboo patterns, the postcards themselves are displayed separately and are not presented within this book.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the floral and scroll motifs on the garment exhibit stylized paper-cut effects such as sharp edges, layered appearance, and high contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the garment with floral and scroll motifs that have sharp, defined edges and a layered appearance, which are characteristic of stylized paper-cut art. The contrast between the motifs and the garment's fabric also suggests a design inspired by high-contrast paper-cut effects.",
