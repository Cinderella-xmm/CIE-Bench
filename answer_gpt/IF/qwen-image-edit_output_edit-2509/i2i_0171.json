      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the skier's exact pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is depicted in a jumping pose with both skis elevated, which shows a dynamic action of being airborne. Contrastingly, in Image A, the skier is shown skiing downhill on snow with the skis in contact with the surface, indicating a different stance. Thus, the pose is not exactly replicated in the figurine.",

      "question": "Are the skis designed to be detachable from the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of additional skis placed next to the figurine suggests that they are probably designed to be interchangeable or detachable. This is a common feature in action figures or model kits for enhanced customization or playability.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a magnetic snow powder base attached to the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a base with a snow-like textured surface where the figurine is balanced, suggesting it is intended to resemble a snow-covered area. The use of the term 'magnetic' is not visually explicit, but the base design featuring this texture gives the impression of a snow powder base.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly includes a box next to the figurine which shows illustrations of the skier, consistent with typical product packaging for figures, indicating that packaging illustrations have indeed been added.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is depicted holding ski poles and wearing a backpack, maintaining the skier's equipment details seen in Image A, which include these items as part of the skiing gear.",
