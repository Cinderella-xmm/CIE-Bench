      "question": "Does the house appear as a sentient, mythical treehouse creature rather than a conventional dwelling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house has transformed into a fantastical entity with features that appear sentient. It is characterized by a large, singular eye at the top, branches forming part of the structure, and intricate tree-like patterns that give the impression of a mythical creature rather than a conventional house. This transformation is quite distinct from typical architectural elements seen in traditional houses.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vertical support columns replaced with detailed, leg-like wooden structures resembling limbs or roots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the support columns under the house have been transformed into wooden structures that resemble the limbs or roots of a tree. This gives the house a more natural and organic appearance, as if the house is part of a living being. This is a distinct change from Image A, where the supports were simple, straight wooden posts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the straw roof been replaced by an overgrowth of realistic leafy branches forming a natural canopy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof is no longer composed of straw but instead appears as an extension of a tree, with leafy branches forming a natural canopy over the structure. This gives the house an appearance of being part of a living tree, a significant change from the thatched roof of Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the satellite dish transformed into a large, lidless eye with visible iris and pupil features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what was once a satellite dish in Image A is now a large, central eye feature at the apex of the structure. The eye has a distinct iris and pupil, resembling a large, lidless eye, which adds to the mythical and sentient appearance of the house.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the exterior walls fully covered with detailed, textured patterns resembling natural tree bark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior walls have shed their conventional materials and are now covered in detailed, textured patterns that mimic the appearance of natural tree bark. This design mimics the texture of a living tree and differs markedly from the woven bamboo walls observed in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the orange blossoms are visible among the branches, there is no indication of them emitting a soft glow or aura. They appear as part of the tree without any luminescent effects, similar to their natural depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there long, trailing vines descending from the treehouse, giving it an organic, flowing appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed long, trailing vines hanging down from the structure of the house. These vines add to the organic, tree-like appearance of the house, enhancing the impression of it being an integrated part of a natural environment.",
