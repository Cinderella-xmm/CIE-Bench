        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of the sink structure from above, including the faucet and basin layout. This is recognized through the outline and position of elements that match a top-down perspective.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a clear representation of the sink structure viewed from the side but at an angle. This angled side view shows the vertical dimensions and provides a perspective on how the sink protrudes from the vanity piece.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents both the top-down and angled side views within one visual frame, separated but combined into the same image. Each view is distinctly arranged to provide different perspectives in one image.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout of the views is clear and well-organized. The top-down view is presented alongside the angled side view, allowing for easy comparison and understanding of the structure from different perspectives. The dimensions are marked clearly, providing a structured and organized presentation.",
