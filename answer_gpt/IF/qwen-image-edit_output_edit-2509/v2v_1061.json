        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge is surrounded by an ornate, colorful border, and a red tassel hangs from the bottom of the badge. A tassel typically refers to a decorative element made of threads or cords, which is common in designs that integrate textile components for embellishment. Based on the appearance of this hanging feature, it resembles a traditional tassel, which indicates that part of the badge is indeed made from tassel material.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the badge in Image B appears to be realistic rather than adopting the stylized features typical of anime, such as exaggerated expressions or stylized features. The badge's depiction of the cathedral and hot air balloon retains the original realistic artistic representation rather than deviating into a cartoonish or animated style commonly associated with anime.",
