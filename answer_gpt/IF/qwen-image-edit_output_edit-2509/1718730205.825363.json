      "question": "Is the entire image, including the cosmic vortex and forest landscape, rendered in the style of a stained glass window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts a scene that is rendered in the style of a stained glass window. The visual cues include the segmented appearance of the image, with each segment separated by thick dark lines that mimic the lead cames traditionally used in stained glass art. The coloration is vivid and the texture appears glass-like, both elements characteristic of stained glass artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spiral patterns of the cosmic vortex outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines resembling lead cames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral patterns are indeed outlined with thick, dark, continuous lines. These lines resemble the lead cames used in stained glass art to hold fragments of glass together. This reinforces the image's stained glass style as these lines are not present in Image A, which portrays a more natural sky.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sky and tree canopies depicted using deep, saturated colors such as deep blues, purples, reds, and greens characteristic of jewel tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses deep, saturated colors within its depictionâ€”these colors include rich blues, purples, and reds. Such deep and vibrant tones are often associated with jewel tones, which is a common artistic choice to evoke elegance and richness. Image A has softer and more natural colors, whereas Image B's colors are intensified and stylized, further supporting the stained glass effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the stained glass elements (including the spiral and trees) exhibit angular, multi-faceted textures that simulate light refraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the stained glass elements, such as the spiral and the trees, display angular and multi-faceted textures, which simulate the light refraction typical of stained glass windows. This is distinct from Image A, where the natural and smooth textures of the sky and trees are maintained, unlike the glass-like refraction in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image feature soft, glowing light effects, smooth color transitions, and balanced composition that evoke a sense of calm and serenity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, while vibrant and segmented due to its stained glass style, doesn't primarily evoke softness or smooth color transitions. Its segmented, bright, and high-contrast appearance creates more of a dynamic and visually stimulating effect rather than a sense of calm and serenity, which is more pronounced in Image A. Therefore, the characteristics do not align with soft, glowing effects and smooth transitions as described.",
