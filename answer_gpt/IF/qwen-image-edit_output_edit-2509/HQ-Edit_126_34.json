    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the cabin and surrounding landscape rendered with visible, dappled brushstrokes instead of smooth, photorealistic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin and surrounding landscape appear to have a painted quality, characterized by visible brushstrokes that suggest a more artistic interpretation rather than capturing the real-world texture and detail as seen in photorealistic images. This effect is typical in artworks where dappled brushstrokes are used to create a sense of texture and depth. The strokes are noticeable and intentional, aiming for a painterly effect instead of a photographic one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image softened and blended, with reduced contrast and no sharp edges between color areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a more blended approach to colors, where transitions between different hues are smooth, and there are no abrupt changes or high contrast. This technique is frequently employed in paintings to create harmony and fluidity in the depiction, suggesting a soft transition between elements like the sky, trees, and snow, giving a more gentle visual experience.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the surrounding fir trees depicted with loose, expressive brushstrokes and enhanced or non-naturalistic coloration compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the trees are rendered with more expressive and abstract brushstrokes, which give a sense of motion and character beyond natural depiction. The colors of the trees in Image B are somewhat exaggerated, with hues that differ from those typically found in nature, suggesting artistic interpretation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the chimney rendered as a soft, blurred plume with indistinct edges, suggesting motion and warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke plume is depicted with a more artistic flair, showing broad, soft, and blurred strokes. This makes the smoke appear in motion and gives the impression of warmth usually associated with such visual effects in art, where edges are less defined, suggesting a softening factor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ground covered in snow, and are there visible falling snowflakes, maintaining the serene winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ground remains covered in snow, maintaining the serene impression of a winter landscape. Additionally, the presence of snowflakes in the air continues the theme of a calm, snowy scene as observed in winter settings, which is consistent with how snow is typically depicted in winter-themed artworks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the cabin, chimney, surrounding trees, and snow-covered ground still clearly identifiable and present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the artistic interpretations and stylistic changes applied in Image B, the main elements such as the cabin, chimney, surrounding trees, and snow-covered ground remain distinguishable and intact. Their forms and placement within the composition ensure recognizability, adhering to the fundamental structure of the scene presented in Image A.",
