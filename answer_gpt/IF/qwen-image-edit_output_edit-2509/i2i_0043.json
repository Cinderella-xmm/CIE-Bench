        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete is illustrated in an anime style, characterized by the artistic rendering of features such as exaggerated expressions and stylized body proportions.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the athlete is positioned in a crouched stance, closely examining the pose, which includes the arm positioning on the ground and the legs bent. This indicates that the pose of the athlete has been maintained consistently between both images.",

        "No"
      ],

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "explanation": "A character card banner often includes a stylized depiction, background effects, and elements that highlight the character, which Image B does have with the anime-style and energy effects. However, there are no additional elements like text or borders typical of card formats, so it does not completely conform to a character card banner format.",
