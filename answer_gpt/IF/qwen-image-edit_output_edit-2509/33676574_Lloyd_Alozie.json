      "question": "Do the skyscrapers appear as integrated, articulated robotic limbs forming a larger guardian-like figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the most visually dominant feature is the giant robotic figure appearing at the center, with its limbs strategically aligned near the skyscrapers, suggesting it might be integrated with the buildings. The positioning and design of the robot's limbs give the impression of being part of the urban backdrop, contributing to the appearance of a guardian-like figure. Given this scenario, the intent of the image may be to represent a fusion between architecture and robotics, symbolizing a powerful presence over the city.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible neon circuitry patterns running along the facades of the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features neon-lit circuitry designs that are prominently visible on the robotic figure, rather than on the buildings themselves. These patterns are visually indicative of advanced technology, but are not observed running along the facades of the buildings. The neon circuitry is integrated with the robot's design, enhancing its sci-fi appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the building facades feature reflective, scale-like panels arranged in an overlapping or segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facades of the buildings in Image B do not exhibit reflective, scale-like panels. Instead, they maintain a typical skyscraper design with regular glass and metal facades as seen in urban architecture. The focus is more on the artistic representation of the robot than altering the conventional aesthetic of the buildings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the expressways depicted as glowing, curving, spine-like structures emitting light and winding through the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the expressways are portrayed with glowing light trails, resembling a spine-like structure that curves and winds through the city. This artistic rendering of expressways is notable for its fluidity and luminous glow, reminiscent of futuristic infrastructure, emphasizing movement and flow in contrast to the static nature of buildings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of the buildings feature enhanced, fin-like vertical structures that resemble mechanical protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the buildings with enhanced, fin-like vertical structures resembling mechanical protrusions. The architectural designs maintain conventional building tops without radical changes that would make them look mechanical.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there rotating holographic elements positioned across the skyline that resemble pulsing, eye-like forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the large robotic figure and the glowing expressways, but it does not show rotating holographic elements in the sky that resemble eye-like forms. The skyline is predominantly occupied by buildings and the robot itself, without additional futuristic holographic displays.",
