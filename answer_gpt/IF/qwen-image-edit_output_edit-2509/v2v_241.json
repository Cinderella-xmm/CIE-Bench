      "question": "Are the horse and elephant depicted as chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse and elephant are visually characterized by oversized heads, large round eyes, and simplified body shapes, which are typical features of chibi-style characters. This style is often used to create cute and exaggerated representations in 3D animations or models, aimed at creating a playful and endearing look. Therefore, based on the visual cues, they are depicted as chibi-style 3D models.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is visibly positioned standing upon the back of the elephant, similar to its position in Image A. This can be discerned from the visual placement of the horse's legs directly on the elephant's body, maintaining the composition and concept of the original setup.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a grassy field and a sky with clouds. These elements maintain a realistic representation, similar to those found in digital or real photography. The grassy field has defined texture and the sky is consistent with real-world appearance, indicating photorealism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits features typical of 3D modeling, where objects are depicted with dimension and perspective, enhancing the depth and volume perception. The horse and elephant have rounded edges, distinct highlights, and shadows, indicating they are 3D renderings rather than flat illustrations.",
