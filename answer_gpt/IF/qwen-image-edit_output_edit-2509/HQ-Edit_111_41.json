      "question": "Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the chair appears to be constructed entirely from LEGO-style bricks. The design features the distinct, recognizable block shapes and studs typical of LEGO bricks, indicating that every part of the chair, including the seat, backrest, armrests, and base, is constructed using these elements. This suggests a modular and geometric construction characteristic of LEGO creations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seat and backrest are depicted in black and have the smooth, glossy finish observed in high-quality LEGO bricks. This gives them a sleek appearance, closely resembling the texture and style of LEGO bricks, albeit in a realistic rendition that captures their intended material while still maintaining the iconic LEGO look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the armrests and the main structure of the base are in a light gray color rather than silver. The light gray color is a typical LEGO color used for structures and parts like these, suggesting that the armrests and base are not rendered in silver but a different shade.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are presented as clear, modular pieces with a translucent gray appearance. This translucency and color are consistent with certain LEGO pieces designed to mimic real-world transparent materials, such as glass or certain plastic parts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the seat and backrest as assembled from large, singular pieces rather than being composed of visibly layered bricks. There are no smooth gradients between layers or evident stacking typical of multiple LEGO layers; instead, they have solid, smooth surfaces typical of single brick panels.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armrests appear as straightforward constructions using basic LEGO pieces that are linear and flat, without any indication of padding or curved design. They likely consist of a few hinged components assembled in a linear fashion, in line with the modular nature of LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface underneath the chair in Image B is not solid white, but rather has a light tonal quality similar to a photographic studio floor with shadow gradients suggesting a neutral background setting rather than a plain white tabletop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B effectively emphasizes the geometric, modular construction of the chair, showcasing visible edges of the LEGO brick elements and clear lines throughout the design. This highlights the distinct character of LEGO constructions, characterized by the modular assembly of interlocking bricks and precise geometric alignment.",
