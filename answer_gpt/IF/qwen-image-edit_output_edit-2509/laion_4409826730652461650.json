      "question": "Is the plush horse depicted in a cartoon style with bold outlines and vibrant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show a horse drawn with bold outlines and vibrant colors typical of cartoon illustrations.

      "question": "Does Panel 1 include a dusty road and cacti in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the visual elements in Panel 1 of Image B reveals a background with cactus plants and a dusty road, which are indicative of a desert or western setting. These elements are missing from Image A, which has no background details.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the horse in Panel 1 looking into the distance with a determined facial expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 1 shows the horse with a determined facial expression and eyes focused forward, contributing to the depiction of intention and focus. This is a clear contrast to Image A, where the plush horse has a neutral and friendly expression typical of toys.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B depicts a human character rather than a horse. The human is smiling and twirling a lasso, conveying confidence in a western scene. Image A has no characters other than the plush horse itself, which further indicates the absence of these actions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 features a backdrop with wooden buildings typical of a western village setting, recognizable as saloon-style structures often seen in such contexts. This contrasts with Image A, which predominantly focuses on the plush horse without such environmental details.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently displays the text 'Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!' at the top, setting the theme of the cartoon strip with large, bold fonts. There is no comparable text or thematic content in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly is divided into two panels, indicative of a comic strip format, featuring sequential storytelling elements. Image A, in contrast, is a single image focusing solely on the plush horse, lacking panel separation.",
