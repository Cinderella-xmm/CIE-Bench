      "question": "Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings of the zebra are visually analyzed to determine the interaction between the zebra's stripes and the ground. The ground is represented in a black-and-white striped pattern that mimics the zebra's stripes, suggesting a seamless integration. The visual effect gives the impression that the zebra's stripes extend into the background, blending with the surroundings uniformly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the grassland rendered in a black-and-white striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the area where the grass would typically be is depicted with a black-and-white striped pattern, instead of natural green grass. This pattern is similar to the zebra's stripe pattern, replacing the natural ground texture with a designed one.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Surrealism often involves dreamlike scenarios that blend reality with imaginative elements. In Image B, the zebra stands on a ground that is depicted as a continuation of its stripe pattern, creating an unusual scene where the environment and animal are visually connected in a way that defies real-world logic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the grass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than transitions or breaks, the zebra's stripes appear to match the ground pattern seamlessly. The continuity of the black-and-white stripes from the zebra to the ground creates a smooth visual connection, with no evident abrupt transitions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the zebra's original body proportion been maintained despite the extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body appears consistent in terms of shape and size when compared to a typical zebra. Upon analyzing its physical form, the proportions seem intact as the stripes continue into the background without altering the body's appearance.",
