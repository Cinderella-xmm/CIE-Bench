        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's stickers seem to follow a typical sticker format which is usually closer to a 1:1 or square-like ratio. The chibi style typically does not align with a 9:16 ratio seen more commonly in portrait mode displays or telecommunication. Each sticker provides a distinct and standalone unit typically not confined to elongated dimensions.",
