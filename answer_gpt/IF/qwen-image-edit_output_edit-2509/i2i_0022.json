      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is shown in a curled-up posture, lying compactly on the hood of the car. The way the legs, tail, and head are positioned follows the natural posture a cat takes when resting. Visual cues from Image B depict the cat in a similar curled posture as commonly associated with comfort and relaxation in animals, especially cats.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually represents the cat's fur using flat illustration techniques characterized by simple gradient color blocks, typical in simplified or cartoon-style art.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the car as having a smooth and curved surface with minimal detailing, highlighting only the reflection lines on the windshield. This representation indicates a significant simplification from the complex detailing found in real-world imagery, focusing on stylistic elements rather than realistic attributes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's visual attributes highlight that the sticker has an irregular shape defined by a thick white outline. This is apparent in the illustration's edges distinctly separating it from a transparent background, mimicking common sticker design aesthetics where the sticker is cut following the silhouette of the primary image or design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by minimalist illustration techniques, evident in the simplified details of both the cat and the car elements. The use of simple color gradients, basic shapes, and reduced complexity aligns with artistic choices often seen in chibi stickers, intended for a visually appealing yet uncomplicated style, suited for sticker designs.",
