      "question": "Is the police car fully constructed from LEGO bricks, with no realistic or photographic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on image B, the police car appears entirely made from LEGO bricks. The characteristic LEGO studs are visible on the surface of the car, and it maintains uniformity in texture typical of LEGO construction, with no photographic elements like realistic textures or materials apparent. Thus, the conclusion is that the entire car is constructed from LEGO.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body panels of the car primarily composed of blue and black LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing image B, the car's body panels are predominantly blue, which is common for LEGO sets depicting police cars, with the bumpers and additional elements in black. These colors are typically used to represent police cars in LEGO form. Therefore, the body panels are primarily composed of blue and black LEGO bricks.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the emergency lights on top and the front headlights made from red and blue translucent LEGO pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the emergency lights on top of the car appear as red and blue, which is typical of police vehicles. They are constructed from LEGO pieces but there is no specific indication of translucency in the pieces used for the lights and headlights within the given image description. Upon conventional construction, these LEGO pieces typically are translucent. Given this common LEGO design, the conclusion is that they are made from translucent pieces.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the windows of the car constructed from beige LEGO bricks instead of transparent or clear pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the windows are constructed from beige LEGO bricks, which lack transparency. This design choice simplifies the window construction in LEGO models, deviating from transparent or clear pieces commonly used in more realistic models. Thus, the windows are indeed constructed from beige bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grille and wheels constructed from small LEGO blocks showing detailed brickwork and modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, both the grille and the wheels seem to be made from larger LEGO pieces rather than numerous smaller blocks typically showing detailed brickwork. This approach is frequently used to streamline construction and avoid intricate detailing in simpler LEGO models. Hence, the answer is that they do not showcase detailed brickwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the LEGO car positioned on a plain matte gray surface with no additional textures, patterns, or background details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the LEGO car on a simple matte gray surface with an unblemished and uniform appearance, lacking additional textures, patterns, or complex background details that would detract from the primary focus on the LEGO car itself. The lack of any distinguishing features in the surface supports this observation.",
