      "question": "Is the elephant enclosed within a visible glass display case with ornate framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is clearly visible inside a glass display case.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the elephant been scaled down to a miniature size relative to the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears smaller compared to typical life-sized proportions when considered alongside other objects like bonsai trees and the enclosed display case. This discrepancy suggests a deliberate downscaling to fit the theme of the display with other elements, indicating it is a miniature version.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant in Image B does not show visible golden inlays on its surface. The sculpture appears carved with traditional patterns but lacks distinct golden elements that typically highlight or accentuate features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are several small bonsai trees placed around the elephant, contributing to a garden-like scenery. These trees are distinctly visible inside the display case and positioned to complement the aesthetic of a landscaped environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a scene with bonsai trees and other vegetation that suggests a carefully curated garden rather than a dense jungle. The colors are earth-toned and complement each other; however, the layout lacks the density associated with a jungle setting.",

      "choices": [
