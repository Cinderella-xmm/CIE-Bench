      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the only remaining elements in the image the red-and-gray train and the \"STOP\" sign, presented with geometric color blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and the 'STOP' sign are stylized with a geometric and minimalist approach. The scene focuses on these elements without additional details or realistic surroundings that are present in Image A. This simplification points towards a limited presentation focusing on just the train and the sign.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is reduced to basic shapes and colors, including simple geometric outlines representing mountains and tracks. There is no presence of extra details like vegetation or other complexities that could be seen in a realistic image such as Image A. This aligns with a simplified, abstract depiction of features.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
