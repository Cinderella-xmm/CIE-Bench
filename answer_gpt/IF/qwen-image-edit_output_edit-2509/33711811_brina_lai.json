      "question": "Are the snowy mountain peaks visibly reshaped into jagged, wing-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks have been transformed visually into structures that resemble wings due to their sharp, jagged nature and the way they fan out, which is different from traditional mountain shapes. This appearance combined with symmetry suggests wing structures, which is a common depiction in mythical creature illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the foreground lake display a pattern of reflective, scale-like textures across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the lake in Image B features repeating patterns that are reflective and curved, resembling scales, commonly associated with fantasy imagery of dragons or sea serpents. This is distinct from the natural look of a lake, which typically has small waves or disruptions rather than an organized scale pattern.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the winding peninsula reshaped into a long, curving, sinewy tail structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what was originally a peninsula in Image A appears transformed into a part of a creature's body - specifically a tail. The resemblance comes from its continued curved form and the way it seems integrated into the rest of the creature’s body in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant houses reconfigured into a continuous, segmented metallic spine-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The distant structures in Image B do not appear to have been altered to form a contiguous, metallic spine-like formation. They remain in a similar setup to Image A and can still be identified as houses or small buildings, without notable modification to appear as a spine.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there distinct, swirling cloud formations in the sky that resemble eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds do not form eye-like shapes. The eyes perceived in the image are part of the creature's design and are integrated into the wing structure and not from the clouds themselves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the grassland area show directional, windswept textures resembling fur covering the creature’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassland in Image B is visually altered to have a textured, fur-like appearance. The pattern shown simulates fur or hair, which adds to the creature’s depiction by linking the ground textures with the body of a mythical beast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all modified elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, eyes, fur) integrate seamlessly into a single, coherent mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various elements including wings, scales, tail, and fur are modified to create a cohesive mythical beast depiction. However, not all elements mentioned, specifically metallic spine and clouds forming eyes, are present as suggested. Therefore, the integration is partial.",
