      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis player has been transformed into a 3D chibi-style figure. The proportions of the figure, such as the larger head compared to the body, simplified features, and cartoonish style, are typical characteristics of chibi-style depictions. Recognizing the visual cues indicative of chibi art, like exaggerated and stylized designs, confirms this portrayal.",
