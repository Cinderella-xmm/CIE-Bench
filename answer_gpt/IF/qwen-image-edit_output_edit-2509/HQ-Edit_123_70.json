      "question": "Is the image split into two distinct panels, one on the left and one on the right (or top and bottom), forming a comic layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is noticeably divided into two panels, with the left featuring a bear and the right showcasing the stages of a salmon's life. This layout is common in comics to separate different parts of a narrative.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear does not appear to be wearing spectacles nor conveying a thoughtful expression; rather, it stands with a neutral body posture. Spectacles would typically be small and resting on the bear's nose, which is not present here.",

      "is_correct": false
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 of Image B includes a speech bubble above the bear, and the text within it asks, ‘Ever wondered how a salmon ends up in a bear's mouth?’ This observation is confirmed by the content of the speech bubble itself.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 displays a salmon emerging from the water along with a diagram indicating several life stages. While the chart labels 'egg,' 'fry,' 'smolt,' and 'adult,' the labeling sequence is altered ('egg' to 'smolt' to 'adult'), lacking 'fry' in the linear order.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, a text box is present, reading, 'Journey’s end in the giver life to the forgest.' The text is somewhat different from the one specified, showing an error in the words 'giver' and 'forgest.'",
