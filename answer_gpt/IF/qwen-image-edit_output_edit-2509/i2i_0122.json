      "question": "Has the original desk been replaced with an outdoor café table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an outdoor setting with visible snow on the ground and a different table design than Image A. Image A has a wooden indoor table with a smoother surface, while Image B shows a table with visible frost or snow on it, indicative of an outdoor café table. This reasoning uses the visual cues of snow and outdoor furniture style.",

      "question": "Is there a snowy cabin visible in the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of a log cabin in a snowy setting, with snow visible on the roof and surrounding areas. This is an entirely different background compared to Image A, which appears to be an indoor setting without any cabin or snow.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image display elements contributing to a warm winter atmosphere, such as warm lighting or steam from the drinks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses visual elements like steam rising from the drinks and the warm, golden lighting of a sunset or sunrise in the snowy environment. These elements together create a typical warm winter atmosphere visually, contrasting with the cold surroundings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table is visibly placed in front of the cabin setting with appropriate shadows and perspective, implying a correctly positioned outdoor café table in relation to the cabin. This takes into account spatial awareness and perspective cues.",

      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The original indoor background from Image A, including any furniture or wall designs, is not present in Image B, which has been completely transformed into an outdoor snowy scene. The objects, like the cups, are present but not the background elements.",
