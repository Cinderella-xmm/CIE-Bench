      "question": "Have the vegetables and knife been broken down into geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the visual elements appear to be a collection of geometric shapes and patterns that are abstracted from their original forms. These geometric shapes have been used to stylize what was previously recognizable objects—such as vegetables and a knife—into an artistic rendering. By observing the edited image, it can be determined that the composition includes various angles, curves, and lines, typical of geometric abstraction.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes rearranged in an abstract manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a variety of geometric shapes arranged seemingly without regard to the conventional relationships between the represented objects. The elements are positioned in a way that does not adhere to realistic perspective or proportion. Based on the style and placement of the shapes, the answer is that the geometric shapes are indeed arranged abstractly, suggesting a deliberate disruption of spatial order for artistic effect.",

      "question": "Are the vegetables and knife still recognizable despite being abstracted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the knife is only somewhat recognizable due to its characteristic blade shape amidst the geometric patterns. However, the abstraction is significant, and the vegetables are hardly discernible within the artwork due to the extensive transformation into abstract shapes. Given the extent of abstraction and artistic distortion, the vegetables and knife are not clearly recognizable.",

      "question": "Has the color palette been simplified to align with Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a range of bold, primary colors and simplified hues akin to the Cubist style, which often employs such palettes to accentuate shapes and form relationships. The color palette appears less detailed and more uniform compared to multiple shades in realistic depictions, following Cubist tendencies of simplified and contrasting colors, thus reflecting the expected style.",

      "question": "Does the image show overlapping planes and multiple perspectives characteristic of Cubism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of geometric shapes indicates overlapping forms and uses multiple angles to suggest depth and dimensionality. This is a common element in Cubism, where objects are depicted from various viewpoints to create a cohesive yet fragmented visual experience. The usage of overlapping planes and diverse perspectives fits within this artistic movement, suggesting its influence on the edited image's composition.",
