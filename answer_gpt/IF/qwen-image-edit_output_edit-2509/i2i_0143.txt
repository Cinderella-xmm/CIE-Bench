The visual perspective and placement indicate that the meter remains in its original position relative to the viewer despite the change in background. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent foreground presence in both images, suggesting the meter's unchanged relative positioning.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the desert highway include sand and sparse vegetation in the background?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B features typical desert characteristics, namely sand and sparse vegetation along the highway. This visual information aligns with the description of a desert setting, where minimal plant life is spread across sandy terrain. The absence of dense vegetation further supports this conclusion.",
