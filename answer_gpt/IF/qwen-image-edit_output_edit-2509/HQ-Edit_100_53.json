      "question": "Does the edited image feature bold black outlines around figures and objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, there are prominent, bold black outlines surrounding the main subject and the objects. This type of outlining is characteristic of traditional Japanese woodblock prints, where strong lines are used to define shapes and figures. This explains the distinct separation of elements, which is typical in ukiyo-e art.",

      "question": "Are the colors on the kimono flat and uniform without gradients or realistic shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the colors on the kimono appear flat and lack the realistic shading and gradients present in modern illustrations or photographs. The coloring is consistent with traditional printmaking techniques, where solid blocks of color are used rather than nuanced shading. This is typical in ukiyo-e style, which often employs flat areas of color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms depicted with simplified shapes and muted pink hues rather than vibrant or detailed rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in the edited image are represented with simplified shapes and a more muted pink tone. They are not intricately detailed or vibrant, which is common in art styles that don't aim for photorealism. Ukiyo-e art often simplifies and stylizes elements rather than focusing on realistic representation, resulting in less detailed and more abstract depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the path stones and poles feature visible textured patterns resembling hand-carved or woodblock-style designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the path stones and poles are represented with minimal to no visible texture and are instead presented with simple shapes that do not mimic realistic textures. This aligns with the style of traditional Japanese woodblock prints, which often depict surfaces in a flat manner without visible hand-carved texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background include stylized distant rolling hills rendered in a manner consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape compositions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the edited image includes simplified and stylized representations of rolling hills. These are depicted in a manner consistent with traditional ukiyo-e compositions, where such elements are often idealized and rendered with clear lines and soft colors, enhancing the artistic flatness typical of the genre.",
