      "question": "Does the elephant’s skin feature a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's skin clearly exhibits a galaxy-patterned texture, which includes stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues where the skin has been digitally altered to feature celestial elements. The galaxy elements such as stars and swirls are visually distinct and reflective of common depictions of cosmic patterns.",

      "question": "Do the elephant’s tusks exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance with glowing, cloud-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant's tusks in Image B have been edited to appear as if they are composed of a nebula-like material. They have a glowing appearance and cloud-like textures, showcasing a blending of colors and light indicative of cosmic imagery. Such visual features are consistent with artistic representations of nebulae, leading to a conclusion that the tusks exhibit this nebula-like appearance.",

      "question": "Are the elephant’s ears replaced with vast, sail-like structures that reflect starry constellations and have a celestial appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's ears are transformed into large, sail-like structures covered with starry constellations, giving them a celestial appearance. The design mimics a cosmic canopy spread across the ears, suitable for portraying vastness and a starry night sky. This transformation is evident when considering the edited pattern and shape in contrast to typical elephant ears.",

      "question": "Does the elephant’s trunk emit a visible, swirling cosmic mist composed of glowing particles or nebula-like vapor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trunk of the elephant in Image B emits a visible, swirling cosmic mist. The illustration uses colors and patterns that mimic the appearance of nebulae, with glowing particles and vapor-like textures. This type of visual manipulation is intentional to evoke celestial imagery, which is apparent from the depiction of swirling clouds and luminous effects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the presence of glowing planetary rings encircling the elephant's legs. These rings are depicted with radiant colors and a bright appearance, creating an effect reminiscent of celestial bodies often seen with rings around them, like Saturn. The edited embellishments around the legs are conspicuous and visually aligned with the theme of space and planets.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet of the elephant display luminescent star patterns that are visibly glowing. The design includes bright star-like spots against the skin, enhancing the cosmic theme of the image. This artistic choice effectively utilizes contrasting colors to create a glowing effect that draws attention to the feet.",
