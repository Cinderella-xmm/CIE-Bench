      "question": "Is the entire body of the truck constructed from visible LEGO bricks in orange, black, and silver colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a truck that is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks, identifiable by the distinct blocky appearance and interlocking design typical of LEGO. The truck body features prominently visible colors in orange, black, and silver. Analyzing the LEGO model's representation of colors used for the bricks matches the description given in the question.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wheels composed entirely of circular gray LEGO pieces, replacing the original tire and rim design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the truck wheels display a clear LEGO construction, with the rims consisting of circular gray LEGO pieces incorporated in the overall design. The question indicates a replacement of the tire and rim design seen in regular truck models with LEGO elements. The distinct round shape and visible gray coloration confirm the accuracy of the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth black LEGO tiles, replacing the original textured surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed construction visibly showcases LEGO components characterized by their uniform smooth texture without additional detailing. The sleek, plain surface effect aligns with the idea of using smooth black LEGO tiles to fill in the truck bed area. The question accurately describes the absence of intricate texture, usually found on regular truck beds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck placed on a plain white shelf that elevates it above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the LEGO truck positioned atop what appears to be a white platform or shelf. This platform elevates the model slightly above the ground, creating a minimalistic presentation setting. Visually, the elevation brought by the white shelf can be clearly perceived, fitting the question's description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the LEGO model retain the correct shape and proportions of the original pickup truck, including the cab, bed, and wheelbase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the LEGO model in Image B maintains a recognizable representation of the pickup truck seen in Image A. Despite the limited detailing inherent to LEGO constructions, the overall shape, including the cab, bed, and wheelbase, closely follows the form and proportions of the original truck. The model captures essential design elements that convey the truck's recognizable silhouette and proportions.",
