      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures within the packaging box are full-sized with no evident exaggeration of features typical of chibi-style art, such as large heads and small bodies.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along with the main figures, there are accessories like helmets and tools visible outside the box in the lower foreground. These items are distinctly positioned outside the main packaging display, suggesting they could be part of the set but not within the box as it is shown.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures outside the box in Image B, while representing toys, have smooth surfaces and display patterns more typical of manufactured plastic items rather than realistic textures or lifelike appearances, which would involve more detail and nuanced texturing.",
