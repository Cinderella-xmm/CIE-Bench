        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog appears to be crafted in a simplified and blocky style characteristic of LEGO figures. The stop sign resembles a LEGO design with clear geometric shapes and bright coloring, commonly used in LEGO sets. This artistic shift from a real dog atop a real sign to LEGO pieces implies a deliberate style change.",
