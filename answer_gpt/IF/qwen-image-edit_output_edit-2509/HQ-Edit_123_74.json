      "question": "Has the snowboarder's helmet been enlarged proportionally compared to their head and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet on the snowboarder appears to be large and prominent, matching a stylized or cartoonish representation often used in illustrations to emphasize certain features. However, it does not appear disproportionately large compared to typical helmets worn for snowboarding, where safety features are a priority. By considering typical helmet designs and their functional needs, the helmet in the image seems appropriate for the scene presented.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's hands appear proportionate to their arms and body. There is no exaggerated size that would suggest disproportionate enlargement.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snowboarder's outfit in bright red, which is striking and stands out strongly against the background dominated by blue and white tones. This high contrast is a common technique in design to make the subject stand out, and it achieves that effect in this image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B, such as the snowdrifts and pine trees, do have a stylized representation that suggests a paper-cut style. The sharp, clean lines and apparent layering give an appearance similar to cut paper art, which is a recognizable artistic style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several variations of the snowboarding stance: the main large image features one pose, while smaller accompanying images display different stances or tricks. This suggests multiple actions or poses, similar to action presets or sequences in a collector’s display.",

Such design choices are common in collectors' albums showcasing a thematic or seasonal interest.",
