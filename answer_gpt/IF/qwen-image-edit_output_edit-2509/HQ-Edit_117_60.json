      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sailboat rendered entirely as a carved walnut wood sculpture, with no metallic, fabric, or realistic marine materials visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sailboat appears to be entirely made of wood, indicated by its uniform color and texture resembling walnut wood. The absence of any metallic sheen or fabric-like texture supports the conclusion that no realistic marine materials are visible. Based on these visual cues, the choice of materials seems to be all wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sails made of smooth, polished walnut wood featuring visible and intricate grain patterns, rather than fabric or translucent material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B show a distinctive wood grain pattern, common in polished walnut. They lack any fabric-like characteristics such as folds or translucency, which are typical for marine sails. The visible grain and smooth texture suggest they are indeed made from polished walnut wood.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hull of the sculpture feature deep, textured carvings that clearly mimic the appearance of wooden planks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the hull shows detailed carvings that resemble wooden crafting techniques, which are often used to replicate the appearance of wooden planks. This is evident in the detailed and textured patterns visible on the hull suggesting the intended mimicry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that elevates it above the water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the sailboat atop a pedestal which is color-matched as pale beige. The pedestal distinctly sets the sculpture away from any water surface as shown in Image A, visually 'elevating' it within the frame.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the natural wood tones and detailed craftsmanship of the walnut sculpture clearly stand out against the background, without being obscured by similar colors or excessive brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a clear distinction between the walnut sculpture and the background sunset. The dark tones and detailed craftsmanship remain visible and contrast well against the lighter background hues, avoiding any visual blending or excessive brightness interference.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water consistent with the wooden sculpture, showing the carved hull and walnut sails, rather than a realistic boat reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no reflection in the water, as the sculpture sits on a pedestal. Therefore, there cannot be a reflection that would show any carved hull or walnut sails, making the question of consistency with reflection moot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
