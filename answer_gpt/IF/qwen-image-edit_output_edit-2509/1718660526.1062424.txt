    "Question": "Q1: Is the animal composed of small, distinct ceramic tiles arranged to form its body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal is visually composed of numerous small and distinct pieces that are systematically arranged, resembling ceramic tiles. This observation is based on the shiny, smooth, and reflective properties typical of ceramic tiles, along with the visible seams between each piece, which is a characteristic of mosaics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stripes made from glossy ceramic tiles in vibrant orange and deep black?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the animal with alternating colored tiles that catch light, contributing to a glossy appearance. The colors of these tiles—orange and black—are vibrant and richly saturated, suggesting the use of glossy ceramic tiles. This is based on the reflective quality of the tiles observed in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes and snout formed from precisely cut ceramic tiles that maintain their expressive appearance?",
    "explanation": "The eyes and snout in Image B appear structured and dimensional, suggesting careful arrangement of precisely cut tiles to achieve their shapes. Despite being made from tiles, they retain the essential expressive features such as the bulging eyes and rounded snout seen in the original object, indicating precision in their construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Is the mosaic animal positioned on a surface with a visible sandy texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal is shown standing on a platform that visually resembles sand, with a rough texture and visible grains. This is deduced from the granular appearance and color typical of sand, contrasting with the smoothness of the ceramic tiles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a clear visual contrast between the smooth, glossy surface of the tiles and the rough, granular texture of the platform?",
    "explanation": "The contrast is evident in Image B, where the tiles on the animal's body are smooth and reflective, indicating glossiness, while the platform beneath appears to have a rough, sandy texture. This contrast in texture and appearance highlights the difference between the material of the animal and the surface it stands on.",
    "answer": "Yes"
