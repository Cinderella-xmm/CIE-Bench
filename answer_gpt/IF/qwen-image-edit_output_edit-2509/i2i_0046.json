    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image have a white border surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a distinct white border encasing the entire image, reminiscent of a Polaroid-style border. This matches the visual characteristics of photos that use a retro or instant film look. There is a clear distinction between the image and the border, making it easy to identify.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the caption “11:13 AM” visible at the bottom within the white border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of the white border of Image B, the caption '11:13 AM' is clearly visible. This placement is common for time stamps in Polaroid-style photography, where the date or time is occasionally printed within the white space for a nostalgic effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the faded effect been applied to the entire image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there does not appear to be a faded effect applied uniformly across the entire image. The colors remain vivid, especially the blue sky and the skater's clothing, which would be dulled in a faded or vintage effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image have a paper-like grain texture applied to it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to have a paper-like grain texture, which can be observed if the image's surface resembles an uneven or matte finish, similar to printed photographs on textured paper. This texture makes it resemble a classic Polaroid print.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original composition and elements of the image preserved, aside from the added white border, caption, faded effect, and grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, all original compositional elements such as the skater, skateboard, and background elements are preserved in Image B. The only changes are stylistic, such as the white border, caption, and texture. The primary visual subjects remain unchanged.",
