      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical or dome-shaped structure resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is clearly placed within a transparent sphere, which is characteristic of a snow globe. The spherical shape is visible and contains both the upper and lower parts of the scene inside it, combined with typical snow globe features like simulated snowfall and miniature scenic elements. This matches the traditional design of a snow globe.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The upper part of Image B shows a Paris skyline where the buildings, including the Eiffel Tower, have a metallic look, suggesting a crafted, polished metal finish common in miniature models or decorative items. This can be inferred from the reflective and shiny textures visible in the structures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower tier of the snow globe is depicted with dense and vibrant green vegetation such as trees and hedges, which are designed to mimic a garden or park-like setting. The intense green color suggests a lush and healthy appearance, typical of decorative miniatures which emphasize vibrant colors.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows numerous small white particles throughout the atmosphere within the snow globe, which simulate the appearance of snowflakes. This is a common characteristic of snow globes, where particles are used to mimic snowfall when the globe is shaken.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the snow globe displays a pattern resembling cobblestones, and classic street lamps are visible in the lower tier of the scene. These elements are typical in detailed miniatures, adding to the authenticity and aesthetic appeal of the model.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains only one Eiffel Tower centrally placed within the scene, unlike Image A which features two Eiffel Towers. The context of a snow globe typically captures a singular iconic monument to represent a city, in this case, the Eiffel Tower representing Paris.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
