      "question": "Has the surfboard been replaced with a giant manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a large manta ray can be seen beneath the surfer. The surfboard is not visible, suggesting the manta ray serves as its replacement. A regular surfboard is a long, narrow board, whereas the manta ray is a large animal with wings. The image shows the surfer positioned in such a way that he seems to be riding the manta ray, indicating that the surfboard has indeed been replaced by the sea creature.",

      "question": "Are the surfers' original poses maintained on the manta ray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer maintains a stance similar to the standard surfing position seen in Image A. Despite the different surface, the balance and posture required for surfing seem consistent between the two images. The surfer's stance remains visibly similar, indicating that the original surfing pose is adapted to the new context with the manta ray.",

      "question": "Does the image include dreamy atmosphere elements like soft lighting or misty effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a large manta ray and soft lighting with certain ethereal qualities. The light appears to have a gentle glow and the sky has an airy quality typical of a dreamy or mystical atmosphere. Elements like highlights, overexposed areas, and a soft focus effect around the manta ray contribute to this impression.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the manta ray depicted as a giant creature beneath the surfer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The manta ray in Image B is significantly larger in proportion to the surfer, creating the appearance of a colossal creature. This amplification in size indicates that the manta ray is depicted as giant compared to its real-life counterpart, given that surfers usually ride atop smaller, manageable surfaces. The size of the manta ray directly suggests that it is portrayed as a giant creature beneath the surfer.",

      "question": "Are the surfer and the manta ray still clearly visible and identifiable despite the dreamy atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even with the dreamy atmosphere, the surfer and the large manta ray retain enough distinct characteristics to be easily identifiable. The silhouette and shape of the manta ray are clear, as are the human figure and form of the surfer. This clarity amidst the soft lighting underscores the visibility and recognizability of both subjects.",
