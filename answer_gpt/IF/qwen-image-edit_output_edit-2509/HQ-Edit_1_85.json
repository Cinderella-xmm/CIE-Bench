      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a series of separate postcard-sized panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout suggests an arrangement typical of a postcard format, with sections for writing and a stamp area visible. These elements imply a design based on the concept of a postcard rather than separate panels, indicating a singular postcard format.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the blouse of the girl with lace details that appear sharp with defined edges, reminiscent of paper-cut designs. The ornamental nature and structure of the lace are visually consistent with the precision seen in cut paper art.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the violin appears proportionate to standard sizes in relation to the girl's body, similar to how children-sized violins look in reality. There is no noticeable enlargement beyond normal proportions, as the instrument remains in scale with her body.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's pose and hand positioning are carefully designed to convey a sense of playing the violin accurately. However, due to the stylized nature of the illustration and blurred face, the sense of refined posture and focus typical of musical expression is less pronounced.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits characteristics of a textured cream stock with a warm off-white tone visible in the background and overall composition. The illustration suggests a soft matte finish with the blend of colors and cream-like background indicative of textured paper.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of Image B, showing musical notes along with sections typically used for writing on postcards, implies the integration of music sheet motifs. These motifs, combined with the blank sections provided, make it suitable for note-taking and written communication.",
