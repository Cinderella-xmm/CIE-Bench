      "question": "Are there exactly six chibi-style stickers in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, we see multiple chibi-style characters. Counting each distinct character's distinct sticker, there are six separate chibi-style stickers present. Chibi-style art often involves small, cute characters, and this image aligns with that by illustrating numerous cute, stylized characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the realm of chibi art, characters are typically depicted with large, expressive eyes. Observing the edited image, all the chibi characters indeed possess large, noticeable eyes that amplify their expressive, cute appeal common in this art style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual composition of the edited image appears more square than rectangular. The aspect ratio 9:16 is typically a vertical rectangle used for portraits, and since this image does not fit that format due to its more balanced dimensions, it does not conform to a 9:16 aspect ratio.",

      "explanation": "Examining the chibi version of the rider, their attire is simplified yet retains notable elements from the original image. The shirt is depicted in a light beige color consistent with the original photo, maintaining visual continuity in the manga-style representation.",
