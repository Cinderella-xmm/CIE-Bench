      "question": "Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling an orange has been equipped with a metal ring and links, indicative of a keychain. Natural fruits do not possess such features. This conclusion is drawn from the presence of these man-made accessories typically found on keychains. Thus, combined with world knowledge about objects used as keychains, this image likely depicts a rubber keychain.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the object has a small, green-colored tip resembling a stem. However, considering this object is identified as a rubber keychain, this 'stem' is likely a part of the keychainâ€™s design rather than a natural component. Compared to Image A, which shows a natural stem, this one is likely artificial.",

      "question": "Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a surface with a similar shine and gloss to that of Image A. This can be attributed to the rubber material of the keychain designed to mimic the glossy exterior of a real orange. The visual texture appears consistent between both images, suggesting the keychain maintains the glossy texture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B has the characteristic round shape, color, and texture associated with an orange, hence making it visually recognizable as a citrus fruit. These attributes align with common knowledge of what defines the appearance of an orange.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a visible metal ring attached to the top of the orange-shaped object, indicative of a keychain feature designed for attaching keys. This attachment point is a standard feature of keychains, aligning with the purpose and design of such items, confirming its presence.",
