    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain the front view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image B, the car is mostly shown from the top view, looking directly downwards. The front of the car is visible but not prominently, as the main image focuses on the top of the car. Thus, the front view is not distinctly contained within the edited image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image contain the side view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image B, the side view is not visibly shown in the direct photograph of the car but is instead included in the form of annotations or design schematics. These schematics depict the car's side profile as line drawings, which offer an understanding of its design rather than a traditional photographically captured side view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image contain the top view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "The edited image B prominently displays the car from the top view in a photographic manner. This is clear from the direct downward angle showing the car's roof and hood, providing a comprehensive top angle of the vehicle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the front, side, and top views visibly combined into a single image?",
    "explanation": "The edited image B combines various views, including top and schematic representations of the side view, into a single collage. However, the front view is not expressly included as part of the image. The views are presented in a manner that collectively showcases different angles of the car's design without a traditional front view photograph.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the combined image clear, appropriately scaled, and presented professionally for the specified uses?",
    "explanation": "The edited image B presents the car's views in a well-organized collage format, combining the top view photograph with schematic illustrations. These are clearly rendered, appropriately scaled, and professionally displayed, suitable for presentations or design analysis that require multi-angle viewing of the car's design features.",
