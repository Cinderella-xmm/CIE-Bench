      "question": "Has the original desk and character structure remained unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition of the painting remains largely the same as the original painting (The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci). The table, characters, and their arrangement have not been modified from Image A to Image B, except for the addition of a modern man. By analyzing the arrangement of the figures and the table setup in both images, it's clear that the core elements have been preserved. Therefore, the desk and character structure is unchanged.",

      "question": "Has a modern man been added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an additional figure that is not part of the original depiction, notably dressed in a contemporary manner. This indicates the presence of new additions, as it's known that the original does not include modern attire or figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern man in Image B is wearing a suit and bow tie, which is typically classified as formal attire. By identifying the details of the man's clothing, which is distinct from the period clothing of the original painting, it confirms that he is dressed formally.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the modern man is holding a wine glass aloft in a manner characteristic of a toast. This action is contemporary and distinct from the positions and gestures of original characters, indicating an addition meant to show a celebratory or social action.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern man in Image B is positioned on the far right side where the original painting might not feature active characters or significant elements. The placement in an area typically not crowded by key original figures supports the observation that he occupies a previously empty space.",
