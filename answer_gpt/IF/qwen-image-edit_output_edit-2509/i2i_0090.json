      "question": "Does the edited image show the stapler from both the front and rear views side by side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are two views of the same stapler placed side by side. On the left, there is a view of the back part of the stapler, recognizable by the tapering shape and lack of visible stapling mechanism. On the right, the front part of the stapler is visible, indicated by the presence of the stapling mechanism under the hood of the same tapering structure. This arrangement confirms that the image captures both the front and rear views of the stapler side by side.",

      "question": "Are the stapler's front and rear views arranged next to each other in a horizontal alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two views of the stapler in the edited image are aligned horizontally. The rear view is positioned on the left, and the front view is placed on the right, showing a clear horizontal arrangement. This setup allows for a direct comparison between the two angles of the stapler, confirming the horizontal alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all parts of the stapler visible in both the front and rear views without any truncation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of both the front and rear views of the stapler in the edited image, it is evident that all parts of the stapler, including the base and the top, are fully visible. There are no indications of missing sections or truncation within the frame of each view, ensuring complete visibility of the stapler in both angles.",

      "question": "Do the front and rear views of the stapler in the edited image match in terms of color and design details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the front and rear views of the stapler feature the same blue color and exhibit identical design characteristics, such as the curved shape and smooth surface. The stapler's consistent color and design details in both views confirm that they match in terms of these attributes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background consistent between the front and rear views of the stapler without additional elements introduced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background for both views of the stapler is a solid green color with a similar gradient, and there are no additional elements present in either view. This consistency in background across the two views highlights uniformity and lack of extraneous elements introduced.",
