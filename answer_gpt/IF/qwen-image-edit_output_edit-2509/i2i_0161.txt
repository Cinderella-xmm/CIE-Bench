    "Question": "Q1: Is there a large title saying “Catch the Wave” placed above the horizon?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Catch the Wave' is prominently displayed at the top part of the image, in a large font size. The phrase is placed against the background sky, which appears above the sea's horizon line. By identifying the horizon as the line where the sea appears to meet the sky, it is clear that the text is positioned above this line. As the text directly appears on the sky above the ocean, it is indeed placed above the horizon.",
