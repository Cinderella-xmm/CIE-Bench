      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of decorative elements and text placed symmetrically and vertically gives the impression of a bookmark format, suggesting a resizing and framing adjustment. Although the image retains a similar size ratio as Image A, the added elements transform its appearance to resemble common bookmark designs.",
