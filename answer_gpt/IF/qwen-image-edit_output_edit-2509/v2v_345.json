      "question": "Has the mouse been converted into a 3D voxel-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse displays a distinctive grid-like structure with visible blocks and pixels, indicative of a voxel-based model. Voxel models use three-dimensional pixels, or 'voxels,' to create a blocky, pixelated style. The mouse in Image B appears to have this characteristic, suggesting it has been transformed into a voxel-style model.",

      "question": "Does the voxel-style mouse model resemble the icons shown on the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mouse model in Image B bears a voxel-type composition, similar to the black object on the left which can be interpreted as a generic representation of voxel art due to its solid, pixelated or block-like features. Although the object on the left doesn't directly appear as a mouse, it shares a pixel art appearance similar to voxel styling, reflecting a resemblance in the blocky texture rather than the form.",

      "question": "Was the scene rendered using Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no direct indication within Image B that confirms the use of Octane rendering specifically. Octane Render is known for realistic rendering capabilities and specific effects such as lighting and shadows; however, without technical metadata or specific visual indications typically associated with Octane, such a conclusion cannot be drawn purely from the image. Thus, the answer should rely purely on the visual evidence rather than assumed software inclusion.",

      "question": "Is the scene rendered in 8k resolution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Determining the exact resolution like 8k from visual inspection alone is not feasible. While Image B might display fine details, specific conclusions about resolution require technical details or metadata that are not ascertainable from the image itself. Hence, based on the visible evidence, this determination cannot be confidently made.",

      "question": "Is the rest of the scene, excluding the mouse, unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing visual elements of Image A and B, the table surface, smartphone, and other layout features such as the position of objects remain consistent between the two images. The primary alteration observed is the voxel-style of the mouse model. Since other elements in the scene remain visually the same as in Image A, the rest of the scene can be considered unchanged.",
