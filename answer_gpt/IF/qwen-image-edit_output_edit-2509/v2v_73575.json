      "question": "Is the bird on the left depicted as an animated origami figure with visible star chart patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the left is designed to resemble an origami paper sculpture, as suggested by the angular shapes and folding structure. The surface is patterned with star chart designs, which look like constellations and celestial patterns. These elements collectively convey the idea of an animated origami creation, distinguishing it from realistic depictions.",

      "question": "Does the bird on the right appear as a luminous crystalline structure with sharp edges and a glowing effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird on the right exhibits a design that resembles crystal formations, characterized by the sharp, geometric facets typical of crystalline structures. The bird is rendered in a transparent, glowing manner, suggesting luminescence akin to glass or ice with internal illumination. Such visual traits correspond to the depiction of a luminous crystalline structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows each bird standing atop large, detailed chess pieces, specifically styled as rooks. These chess pieces are portrayed in a rich ivory hue, with intricate carvings consistent with traditional chess sets but exaggerated in size, adding a grand, surreal quality to the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fantastical library setting where vast, curving bookshelves extend upwards, filled with books. The atmosphere is enhanced by floating books and sheets, creating a dream-like ambiance. The structure and elements suggest a surreal environment rather than an ordinary library, complementing the visual complexity and otherworldly mood of the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the birds are depicted in natural poses on rocks. Comparing with Image B, although the postures have changed to align with the artistic transformation into origami and crystalline forms, the birds maintain a similar upright position on their respective bases. However, since the structural nature of Image B's birds and their bases is entirely different, the postures differ from their natural stance in Image A.",
