      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged into a tidy pile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the calendar pages are stacked neatly into a uniform pile, indicating careful arrangement without any evident disorder. This conclusion comes from observing the alignment and lack of scattered pages that contribute to a tidy appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates still present and unchanged?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that there are handwritten notes and highlighted dates on the top calendar page. However, the style and content seem different from Image A, suggesting changes have been made. The presence of only a few visible notes prevents confirming their complete preservation without examining Image A.",

      "question": "Do the calendar pages and desk surface display convincing textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual quality of Image B shows clear texture details on both the calendar pages and the desk surface. The texture on the calendar pages exhibits a paper grain, while the desk shows a wood grain appearance, which combined with lighting effects, adds realism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes shading and lighting effects distributed around the stack of pages and the desk surface. There are shadows cast by the stacked pages, indicating a light source and depth in the scene, enhancing realism.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the preservation of color and style in text and highlights on the calendar pages is not consistent. The styles and colors were modified; they appear different in Image B from known examples in Image A.",
