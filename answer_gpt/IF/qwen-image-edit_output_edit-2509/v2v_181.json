      "question": "Is the sheep and clock scene enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock are clearly encased within a glass dome, characteristic of a snow globe. The transparency of the dome indicates that the scene is indeed inside a snow globe, allowing visibility of the objects within. This is supported by the traditional appearance of a snow globe, which consists of a clear spherical vessel often containing a scene.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest on a wooden tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the snow globe is placed on a surface that visually resembles a wooden texture. The grain and coloration are typical of wood, affirming that the snow globe is resting on what appears to be a wooden tabletop.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scene illuminated by gentle, ambient lighting, casting warm glows on the table and nearby areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays soft light illuminating the scene, with diffusion implying ambient lighting. The warm tones seen on the table where the light hits, and the overall glow surrounding the snow globe, suggest the presence of warm lighting typical of ambient light sources.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sheep and clock depicted as adorable chibi-style 3D models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock appear realistic and lifelike rather than exaggerated or stylized, which is characteristic of chibi-style. Chibi style often includes exaggerated features like large heads and small bodies for cuteness, which is not evident in the realistic proportions and design of the sheep and the traditional appearance of the clock.",

      "question": "Is the sheep casually leaning against the clock inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep stands beside the clock but does not show any visual cues indicating it is leaning against the clock. The sheep seems to be positioned independently without physical interaction with the clock, typical of scenes where objects are separately placed rather than physically interacting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there gently drifting snowflakes surrounding the sheep inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits small white particles floating within the globe, simulating snowflakes, which are a characteristic feature of a snow globe. The presence of these flakes around the sheep depicts the effect of snow falling, typical inside snow globes that can be shaken to create this visual.",
