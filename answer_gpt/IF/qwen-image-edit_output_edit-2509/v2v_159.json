      "question": "Have the shoes been increased in size while keeping their original design intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear to be larger relative to the legs than is typical in real-life proportions. This observation combined with the cartoon-like style suggests an increase in size. The shoes maintain their original design details, including the laces and color scheme, indicating that the design has been kept intact despite the resizing. In comparison with Image A, the shoes in Image B do look larger while maintaining their original design.",

      "question": "Do the legs appear more cartoon-like compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs have clear outlines and less shading and texture than is typical of realistic images, giving them a cartoon-like appearance. World knowledge of cartoon illustrations typically features simplified shapes and outlines with fewer textures. When compared to Image A, which is more detailed and resembles realistic shading, Image B's legs are more cartoon-like.",

      "question": "Are the feet placed on a shelf shaped like clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feet are positioned on a circular platform which has a flat, solid appearance and lacks any cloud-like features. Clouds are typically fluffy, with soft, broken outlines, and Image B shows a solid shape under the feet with no resemblance to clouds. When compared to Image A, where feet are literally stepping on clouds, Image B displays a distinct platform under the shoes, reinforcing a non-cloud shape.",

      "question": "Does the overall appearance of the legs and shoes reflect a bobblehead-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Bobblehead figures are characterized by oversized heads relative to the body size. Image B shows shoes larger relative to legs but does not feature oversized heads or elements typical of bobblehead toys. In comparison, an increase in shoe size alone doesn't constitute a bobblehead-style transformation as it typically involves disproportionate heads in toy figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shoes still maintain their original design details after being resized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes retain their original design elements, such as the lace style, color scheme, and general panel design seen before the resizing. The cartoon style emphasizes these details clearly. Comparing with Image A, although the shoes are larger in Image B, they maintain the same design, confirming that resizing did not alter the shoe details.",
