    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image divided into at least two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear division between the two sections, each with distinct border lines, separating them into panels. The top titles 'SPY MEETING ON SUNDAY' also indicate divided content. This format is commonly used in comic or storyboard layouts to differentiate scenes or show sequential events.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two men in the image transformed into cartoon-style anthropomorphic agents with visible agent-like characteristics (e.g., expressive faces, limbs, spy traits)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are drawn in a cartoon style, depicting fictional spy agents. One figure has a typical agent characteristic â€” holding a watch communicator, and the other has a camera-like head feature which represents spy equipment. These are common stereotypes for spies, emphasizing secretive or investigative traits.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the plaid-patterned tie have a visible watch communicator device, and is there a visual expression of urgency (such as motion lines or an alarmed facial expression)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure resembling a spy holds a watch communicator, indicating secret communication. The visual design does not incorporate urgency through expressive motion lines; instead, the static nature of the comic panels suggests a narrative without physical urgency effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a circular camera lens symbol embedded within the pattern of the tie with the emblem, and is there a visual indication of activation (e.g., glow, red dot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie on the right side shows a camera symbol as part of the emblem. This representation doesn't include visual effects like glow or red dots typically indicating activation; instead, it remains static and emblematic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there thought bubbles present above or near the heads of the anthropomorphized agents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes thought bubbles above each figure's head, illustrated within each panel showing their thoughts or dialogue. This is a common comic element used to express internal monologue or ideas of characters.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images depict a green field. In Image B, the background remains consistently stylized with a lush green field, matching the original setting in tone, indicating continuity in environment between the real and cartoon depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the text in the speech or thought bubbles use a crisp, minimalist, sans-serif font?",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the font utilized within speech and thought bubbles is stylistically clean but appears serif rather than explicitly sans-serif. It supports readability typically used in professional or comic settings.",
