      "question": "Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chicken wings appear to have a fabric-like texture, resembling plush toys rather than actual food. The color is consistent with golden-brown items, typically associated with cooked chicken wings. However, the presence of the fabric texture suggests they are replicas made to resemble food, combining the visual cues of texture and shape with common knowledge of plush toys.",

      "question": "Is the sauce replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where the sauce is expected, there is a distinctly bright orange object with a soft and textured appearance typical of a pillow. The size and shape also suggest it's a pillow significantly out of context for the setting, leading to the conclusion that the sauce has been replaced by a pillow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the entire scene set on a smooth, light-colored wooden surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the background of the scene is a uniform light color with a texture similar to wood grain. This indicates a wooden surface that is smooth and light-colored. Comparing with common surfaces like tables or countertops, this appearance fits the description of a light wooden surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the plush wings and the orange pillow arranged in the same spatial configuration as the original chicken wings and sauce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A with Image B, the placement of the orange pillow in Image B seems to overlap directly where the sauce was in Image A, suggesting a replacement rather than a changed configuration. The arrangement of other items, such as the chicken wings (or plush replicas), appears consistent between the images, retaining the spatial layout.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the plush wings and pillow clearly appear as fabric-based toys rather than real food items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture and appearance of the chicken wings and the bright orange pillow strongly suggest fabric-based items. The plush texture and unrealistically bright and clean appearance for food items indicate they are toys, combined with knowledge about toy replicas and their typical qualities.",
