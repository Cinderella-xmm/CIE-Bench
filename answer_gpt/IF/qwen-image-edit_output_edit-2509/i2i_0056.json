        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure depicted is a small, simplistic, and exaggerated version of a person, which is characteristic of chibi-style design. This style often features large heads and small bodies, emphasizing cuteness and simplicity, aligning with what is shown in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a character with a yellow hard hat, typical of construction workers for safety. The character also wears a bright yellow long-sleeve shirt and an orange vest with reflective elements, which are common safety attire in construction settings to ensure visibility.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chibi-style 3D character placed at the center of a low-poly construction scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the chibi character in a simple scene with minimalistic shapes like a small crane model and some geometric forms suggesting construction materials. This setup is typical of low-poly design where details are minimized, and the character is centrally placed relative to these elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed a flat, light gray plane providing a neutral and unobtrusive base, typical in low-poly or simplified scene setups. A small crane model, which signifies a construction environment, is included, adding contextual information to the environment.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "The dimensions of Image B are equal in height and width, forming a perfect square, which demonstrates a 1:1 aspect ratio. This uniformity is often used for balanced, focused compositions.",
