        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures standing on the beach are clearly identifiable as pandas due to their distinct black and white fur pattern, round ears, and stocky bodies, which are characteristic features of pandas. The visual cues strongly suggest that the original human surfers have been replaced with pandas. Without referring to Image A, the presence of pandas holding surfboards is evident. By comparing with Image A, where human figures were present, it is apparent that each surfer has been replaced with a panda.",

      "question": "Is the sunset and beach setting kept intact without any changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows a beach scene with a sunset over the ocean, creating a warm glow across the sand and water. The environmental elements like the sunset, ocean waves, and sandy beach are standard features associated with a typical beach scene. When comparing this to Image A, the setting appears consistent with no change in its natural elements or composition. The consistency in lighting, shadows, and color palette indicates the beach setting remains unchanged.",

      "question": "Are the pandas positioned similarly to the original surfers, facing the sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas are standing side by side on the beach, holding surfboards and facing towards the ocean where the sun is visibly setting. This positioning suggests they are facing away from the camera toward the sunset. In comparison to Image A, where the human surfers were also facing the sunset in a similar arrangement, the positioning of the pandas mimics that of the original surfers, confirming they are oriented in the same direction.",

      "question": "Are the pandas holding surfboards in their paws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B clearly show the pandas with their limbs extended, each holding a surfboard beside them. Given the world knowledge of panda anatomy, pandas use their strong paws to grasp objects. The surfboards appear to be held securely by the pandasâ€™ paws. Comparing this setup to Image A, where human hands were holding the surfboards, the substitution is logical and visually coherent, confirming pandas are indeed holding surfboards in their paws.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards retain their original colors and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two surfboards visible: one is yellow, and the other is multi-colored with red and turquoise stripes. These characteristics suggest a distinct design. Upon comparing with Image A, the surfboards held by the surfers are identical in color and pattern, indicating that their design has been preserved in Image B without alteration in style or hues.",
