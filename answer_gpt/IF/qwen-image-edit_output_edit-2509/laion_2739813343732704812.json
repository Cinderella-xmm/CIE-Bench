      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican exhibits characteristics typical of cartoon-style artwork, such as the simplified and rounded shapes of its body parts, and an overall whimsical presentation.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak of the pelican in Image B is designed with a cartoonish exaggeration in its size and shape compared to Image A, where it appears more realistic and proportionate. This exaggeration is typical in cartoon depictions to emphasize certain features for comedic effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican’s eyes are depicted as significantly enlarged and bulging, which is a common technique in cartoons to add humor and convey exaggerated expressions.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feather textures are not preserved as they are in Image A. The edited version simplifies feather details in favor of smooth, painted surfaces typical of cartoon styling, which does not retain the natural texture seen in Image A.",
