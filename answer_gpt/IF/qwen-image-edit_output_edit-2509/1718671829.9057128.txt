    "Question": "Q2: Is the moon depicted as a glowing, radiant circle with visible light rays or halo effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky features a large circle above the cabin, which could represent the sun rather than the moon. It is depicted with radiating straight lines emanating from the circle, which give a glowing effect. However, it does not resemble a traditional moon with a glowing halo effect but rather an illuminated sun with geometric rays typical of Art Deco designs. The style does not convey a moon with natural halo effects; instead, it uses structured radiant patterns.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the plants rendered in symmetrical, patterned arrangements instead of natural growth forms?",
    "explanation": "The plants in Image B are depicted in a stylized manner, arranged in geometric, symmetrical patterns alongside the cabin. This depiction shows a deliberate and repetitive arrangement, aligning with decorative art styles, rather than portraying natural, spontaneous growth forms. Such patterned arrangements are characteristic of graphic art and not representative of how plants grow naturally.",
