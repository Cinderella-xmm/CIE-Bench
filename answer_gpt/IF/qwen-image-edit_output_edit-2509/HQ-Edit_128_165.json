    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the ornate lantern been fully transformed into a jellyfish shape, with a bell-shaped body and flowing appendages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a bell shape with flowing appendages similar to a jellyfish. The soft, glowing design and the appendages suggest a transformation from a lantern to a jellyfish form. The analysis is based on common visual indicators of jellyfish characteristics such as the dome-like body and tentacle-like extensions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the metal framing elements been replaced with iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils extending from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appendages extending from the body resemble iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils, which are typical for jellyfish, contrasting the rigid metal frame seen in Image A. This transformation into softer tendrils suggests a shift towards jellyfish-like characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the glass panels been transformed into a translucent, bell-shaped body that appears soft and fluid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a body that is translucent and bell-shaped, which contrasts with the solid and structured glass panels of Image A. This transformation suggests a fluid, jellyfish-like structure as opposed to the rigid lantern design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original patterns replaced with glowing, swirling, organic bioluminescent designs within the jellyfish's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays swirling organic designs on the body that emit a glow, reminiscent of bioluminescent patterns found in jellyfish, differing from the static patterns seen on the lantern in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing, star-like nodules visible along the length of the iridescent tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the tendrils, glowing, star-like nodules are evident, contributing to the depiction of bioluminescence often seen in deep-sea jellyfish appendages, contrasting with the absence of such features in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the jellyfish depicted floating in an underwater environment with ambient lighting, soft diffusion, and visual elements suggesting water (e.g., particles, light rays, depth)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a floating jellyfish with elements such as particles, light rays, and depth that suggest an underwater environment. This impression of water contrasts with the setting of Image A, which lacks these aquatic elements and looks to be indoors.",
