      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog is illustrated with simplified features typical of a minimalist style, but it does not exhibit the exaggerated proportions or overly cutesy elements characteristic of a chibi-style. Chibi characters usually have large heads relative to their bodies and often express heightened emotions, which are not present here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B, including the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag, are illustrated with clean lines and simple shapes, indicative of a minimalist flat design. There are no gradients or 3D effects, suggesting the focus is on simplicity and two-dimensional representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black dog in Image B is simplified and part of a cohesive scene along with other elements like the bench, radio, and trash bag. It does not stand out as the most prominent element, as all components are given equal visual weight in a balanced composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the illustration incorporate a bold white outline around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, it is clear that a bold white outline surrounds the perimeter of the illustration, which helps separate it from potential backgrounds, emphasizing the contained elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog and bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame of the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular green backdrop acts as a partial frame for the scene. However, upon close examination, neither the dog nor the bench extends beyond this circular boundary. All elements are confined within the frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the illustration transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a composition with a circular green background and a checkerboard pattern indicating transparency surrounding it. This suggests that outside the circular green area, the image is indeed transparent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
