      "question": "Is the central body of the drone redesigned to resemble a robotic face with sharp, angular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the drone is depicted as part of a humanoid figure's head and torso, which has a robotic appearance. The angular features and streamlined design suggest a resemblance to a robotic face, a common aesthetic in futuristic mecha or robot designs. Thus, the drone's central part is incorporated into the humanoid's robotic design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rotor blades are part of a humanoid robot's arms, suggesting they are arm-like structures. The positioning implies dynamic movement, akin to being in motion, consistent with the aesthetic of flying or flapping. These blades are transformed into more anthropomorphic appendages, reinforcing the robot's design.",
