      "question": "Is the entire figure rendered with a dark wood texture resembling an ancient African sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be rendered with a dark wood texture. The surface has a smooth, finely finished look, which is characteristic of traditional African wooden sculptures. The texture is consistent across the figure, suggesting a transformation from a painted or photographed surface to one resembling wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing depicted as deeply incised carved reliefs rather than fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the clothing appear to be deeply carved into the wood, creating a relief effect. This transformation from fabric to carved wood is typical when aiming to convey a sculpture-like appearance. The patterns have depth and texture, suggesting they are carvings rather than fabric designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the beaded crown and earrings rendered in vivid, painted colors on the wooden surface, standing out from the surrounding carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beaded crown and earrings are depicted in vivid, painted colors that contrast with the wooden texture of the rest of the sculpture. This suggests that these elements have been rendered to visually stand out, simulating the appearance of color on a wooden surface, which is commonly done to highlight certain features in wooden sculptures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background transformed into low-relief carvings that depict the jungle scene with visible texture and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not seem to have transformed into low-relief carvings. The background features hieroglyphic-style figures and designs, typical of an Egyptian scene rather than a jungle with visible texture and depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there deeply incised, symmetrical, and symbolic motifs present throughout the sculpture consistent with traditional African art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motifs on the sculpture appear deeply incised and are symmetrical, which is consistent with the style of traditional African art where such patterns are used extensively. The design elements throughout the figure maintain this stylistic integrity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture appears to have a polished finish with subtle highlights and shadowing, giving depth to the wooden surface. This polished look is indicative of a refined sculpture made from quality wood, reflecting traditional craftsmanship.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Has the subjectâ€™s facial expression, posture, and overall proportion been preserved in the sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face is blurred, the facial expression cannot be evaluated. However, the posture and overall proportion of the figure in Image B appear to be preserved from the original, maintaining the same stance and silhouette, suggesting that the transition to a sculpture form did not alter these elements.",
