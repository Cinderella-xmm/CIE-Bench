    "Question": "Q1: Has the diffuse, smoky brown background been replaced with an expansive blackboard?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a blackboard covered with various equations and sketches, replacing the original smoky brown background from Image A. This indicates a significant change in the background, replacing the diffuse, smoky brown setting with an expansive blackboard.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the blackboard intricately covered with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blackboard features numerous chalk-written mathematical equations and diagrams, including swirling galactic sketches, suggesting a scientific setting likely related to physics and relativity. This indicates that the blackboard is indeed intricately covered with such content.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple remain consistent after the background change?",
    "explanation": "In both images, the lighting remains soft and warm, highlighting the same areas on Albert Einstein and the pineapple. The primary difference is the background; however, the foreground lighting appears to be consistent in tone and intensity across both images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the blackboard exhibit an aged appearance?",
    "explanation": "The blackboard in Image B does not exhibit significant signs of aging such as wear, chalk residue buildup, or faded areas. It appears to be a clean and relatively new blackboard, maintaining clear, crisp chalk writings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple remained unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In both images, the position and appearance of Albert Einstein and the pineapple seem consistent. They are in the same relative positions, and there are no noticeable changes in their appearances aside from the background change.",
    "answer": "Yes"
