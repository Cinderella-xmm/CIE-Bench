      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser has a pixelated texture characteristic of LEGO constructions, indicated by the visible lines of small interlocking pieces. The colors are predominantly brown with gold accents that mimic the decorative patterns, typical of LEGO's simplified color palette options. These visual cues, combined with the knowledge of LEGO design, confirm the dresser is built from such bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative patterns on the front of the dresser in Image B appear in slightly raised, blocky forms that suggest the use of multiple small interlocking pieces to shape them. Such detailing aligns with LEGO's functionality, where small bricks are used to create intricate designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the curved sides and legs of the dresser constructed using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the curved sides and legs of the dresser reveal visible step-like transitions rather than smooth curves, indicative of LEGO's limited curving capabilities with bricks. The curve illusion is created through gradual layering of standard bricks rather than smooth sloped pieces often seen in professional LEGO modeling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the marble top been replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the dresser has a uniform gray texture typical of LEGO flat tiles. This indicates that instead of a realistic marble texture, gray LEGO pieces have been used to mimic a flat, solid surface, common in simplified LEGO recreations of complex designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dresser placed on a neutral, plain background that does not distract from the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a muted, plain color that doesn't have any distracting features. This deliberate photographic choice highlights the dresser, focusing the viewer's attention on the detailed LEGO construction without visual distraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO dresser maintain the original two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs around each drawer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a fa√ßade that visually indicates two separate drawer components, echoed by the golden frames around these sections similar to those in Image A. The LEGO structure retains these visual cues to represent the drawers, albeit in a more abstract form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all surfaces of the dresser visibly composed of LEGO bricks, with no realistic wood or metal textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire dresser in Image B is composed of distinctly recognizable LEGO bricks without any realistic textural variations like wood grain or metal sheen that would be present on an actual dresser. This is characteristic of LEGO's uniform plastic surface.",
