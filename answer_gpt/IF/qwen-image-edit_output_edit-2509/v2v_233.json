      "question": "Is the leaf enclosed within a transparent spherical container resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is visibly enclosed within a transparent spherical object. This object has the classic appearance of a snow globe, characterized by its round, clear structure that encloses an object and typically contains decorative elements. Based on its design and common visual attributes, it indeed resembles a snow globe.",

      "question": "Is the snow globe placed on a surface resembling a tabletop near a window?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the spherical object placed on a flat, horizontal surface that resembles a tabletop. In the background, there is a window-like structure, indicated by the light source and the general shape associated with window frames. The positioning and perspective suggest it is near a window.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background softly blurred and contains warm tones such as orange or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is slightly out of focus, creating a soft, blurred effect. The colors visible in this out-of-focus area predominantly include warm tones like orange and yellow, suggesting a warm, ambient setting typical of sunlight filtering through windows or representing sunset light.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there golden sparkles scattered within the snow globe due to sunlight filtering through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, small reflective elements resembling sparkles or glitter are evident within the spherical container. These are typically associated with snow globes and can be viewed as golden due to sunlight reflections or similar lighting effects, contributing to a glittering appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf appears suspended in a medium inside the snow globe that could resemble liquid due to the presence of circular patterns on the base, which may give an impression of ripples. However, the depiction of snowflakes in a classic snow globe context fits the visual narrative more than the idea of water suspension and drifting snowflakes.",
