      "question": "Is the character depicted as a small, stylized chibi figure suitable for a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is rendered in a simplified, cartoon-like style typical of chibi figures, which are characterized by an enlarged head and a small body. This design is often used for cute and collectible items like keychains. The keychain form is confirmed by the presence of a metal keychain attachment. Given these characteristics, it aligns with the common design for keychain figures.",

      "question": "Does the armor feature glossy enamel-like colors with visible reflections and thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor of the character is painted with a glossy finish and bold colors that resemble enamel art. Thick black outlines are used to define the shapes and provide contrast, enhancing the cartoon-like appearance of the chibi keychain. These stylistic elements are typical for creating a high-contrast, eye-catching effect in such merchandise.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character's head significantly larger than the body, while still showing detailed curly hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi style, the head is purposefully drawn larger than the body to emphasize cuteness and expressiveness. Image B shows that the character's head is indeed large compared to its body, consistent with the chibi form, and features curly hair, although simplified, still visible in the artwork. This matches the description of detailed hair in the context of a simplified illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is a small silver chain visibly attached to the character, suggesting it is a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a silver chain is prominently attached to the top of the chibi figure, connecting it to a keychain clasp. This visual detail directly indicates its function as an accessory meant to be used as a keychain, as chains and clasps are standard features for such items.",

      "question": "Is the background a plain, dark, velvet-textured surface without any architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is a plain, dark surface that contrasts with the colorful figure in the foreground. There are no architectural elements visible, and the texture appears smooth, possibly resembling velvet, which is often used to present products elegantly. This plain background helps in emphasizing the chibi keychain by avoiding distractions.",
