      "question": "Are the two table tennis paddles illustrated as cartoon characters with distinct facial features and accessories (one with a red helmet, the other with a blue cap)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two cartoon characters can be spotted. The character with a red helmet doesn't correspond to any paddle but appears near the paddles. The paddles do not have distinct facial features or accessories like helmets or caps, contrary to characters around them. This indicates visual elements and characters are not related as paddles with facial features.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are placed within a box and are not in a posture suggesting movement or leaping from the box. The background does contain sketches resembling a map, yet the paddles are stationary, contradicting the notion of them springing.",
