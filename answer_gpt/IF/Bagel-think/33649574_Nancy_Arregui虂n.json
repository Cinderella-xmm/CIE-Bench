      "question": "Has the rooster been transformed into a mythical phoenix-like creature with an otherworldly appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster features dramatic visual alterations, including vibrant colors, flame-like details, and a mystical aura that are not present in Image A.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors on the rooster are enhanced with bright hues and gradients that mimic the appearance of flames with a shimmering effect. This visually conveys a sense of heat and flames typically associated with fire, differentiating it from the more subdued appearance in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, areas along the rooster's wings and head crest appear to have bright, gold-like accents which give the impression of molten metal. This effect wasn't present in Image A and contributes to the mythical and fantastical theme of Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's eyes have been altered to include bright, glowing colors that could resemble flickering flames. These artistic details create a sense of internal motion and vibrancy, enhancing the mythical transformation. This contrasts with the normal eyes observed in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On close inspection of Image B, there do not appear to be specific rune-like patterns placed on the rooster’s talons. The talons themselves remain in a natural state with no additional markings compared to those in Image A.",
