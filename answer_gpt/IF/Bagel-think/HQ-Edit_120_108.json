      "question": "Are cogs and gears visibly integrated into the armature of the brass lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp's armature is visibly adorned with cogs and gears, suggesting a steampunk design influence which is not present in the original Image A. This addition is evident upon examining the visible mechanical elements on the lamp's arm in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the book's pages display mechanical schematic designs with cog-like margins?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon close inspection, the pages of the book show mechanical schematic designs and are bordered by margins reminiscent of gears. This contrasts with Image A, where the pages appear to have regular text. The additional cog-like margins in Image B match the overall steampunk theme integrated into the edited photo.",

      "question": "Are rivet patterns present on the floral wallpaper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rivet patterns are observable on the floral wallpaper, adding a mechanical flair to the scene which harmonizes with the steampunk elements such as gears and cogs. This differs from Image A, where the wallpaper is purely floral without mechanical elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the overall colors of the image dominated by warm tones such as brass, brown, and amber, consistent with a vintage leather-and-brass palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs warm tones, including shades of brass, brown, and amber, fitting the thematic style of vintage leather-and-brass elements. This color scheme is consistent with the steampunk aesthetic, and when compared with Image A's more muted tones, it provides a more vibrant and stylized ambiance in the edited version.",

      "question": "Is the lamp still casting a focused beam of light directly onto the open book, maintaining the original lighting setup?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the added steampunk elements, the lamp maintains its original function by casting a focused beam of light onto the open book, similar to Image A. This ensures the lighting setup remains consistent with the original image, emphasizing the same area with light.",
