        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts chibi-style stickers which are typically characterized by exaggerated features such as oversized eyes and soft, rounded facial features. This style is meant to give characters a cute, youthful appearance. Based on the visual cues, the scientist in the stickers has large eyes and a stylized look, adhering to the chibi aesthetic. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the scientist in each of the six poses is wearing a consistent outfit of a white lab coat over a light blue shirt. The outfit remains the same across different poses to maintain a uniform appearance for the character. Given these observations, the answer is Yes.",

      "question": "Is the background bright green with hexagonal patterns or chemical formula motifs, leaving some blank white space around each sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a bright green background overlaid with a pattern of hexagonal tiles, mimicking cells or structural representations seen in scientific contexts. There is also deliberate use of blank spaces around the stickers, highlighting each as an individual graphic element. Based on these observations, the answer is Yes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes a pose where the scientist is depicted holding a beaker filled with a colorful, presumably bubbling liquid. This portrayal is in line with the common representation of scientists engaged in experiments, invoking curiosity and exploration. Given the visual evidence, the answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, each sticker is represented in a square-like format without extended height-to-width proportions indicative of a 9:16 aspect ratio. Chibi-style graphics typically follow proportions that suit their aesthetic, which are often wider rather than taller. Based on these observations, the answer is No.",
