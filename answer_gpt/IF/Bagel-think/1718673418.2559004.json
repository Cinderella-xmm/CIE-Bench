    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the island visibly floating above the water, disconnected from any land or water surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island is depicted as a floating landmass surrounded by clouds rather than water, suggesting that it is not connected to any terrestrial or aquatic surface. This is indicated by the complete absence of water and the presence of clouds beneath, suggesting it is elevated in the sky.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all building roofs replaced with mushroom-shaped canopies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although large mushroom structures are present around the island, the roofs of the individual buildings still retain their traditional gabled shapes. The mushrooms are separate entities and do not serve as canopies directly replacing the roofs of buildings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lake's reflection appear distorted, shimmering, or iridescent rather than a clear mirror image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no presence of a lake or water surface; instead, the reflection would be irrelevant as the environment is composed of clouds and sky. Therefore, there is no reflection to analyze or compare for distortion or shimmering effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mountains in the background morphed into structures resembling giant tree roots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a fantasy setting with floating islands, mushrooms, and skies, but there are no giant tree-root structures replacing the mountains. The background features seem more focused on mushrooms and floating land rather than any structure resembling tree roots.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible green vines connecting the buildings on the island?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage and vegetative elements appear mainly along the sides of the floating island and are not prominently connecting buildings. Therefore, there is no visible evidence of vines explicitly connecting the buildings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there colorful, translucent, or glowing bridges connecting the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does show a fantastical element of glowing paths and structures, possibly bridges, connecting the island's structures, indicated by the presence of luminous strands or beams connecting the floating island parts or airships, emphasizing a more whimsical connectivity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the boats replaced with leaf-shaped airships floating above pastel-colored clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no traditional boats visible. Instead, there are flying airships with a more modern or fantastical design above pastel-colored clouds, indicating a transformation from water-based to sky-based transportation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
