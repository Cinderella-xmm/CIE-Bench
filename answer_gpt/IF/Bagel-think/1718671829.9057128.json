      "question": "Are the structural lines of the cabin composed entirely of geometric shapes with no organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin's structural lines are stylized, featuring sharp, angular edges and geometric patterns. There is a dominance of straight lines and precise angles without soft curves, which aligns with geometric shapes without organic elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a glowing, radiant circle with visible light rays or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial body that might be a moon is shown as a bright disk with minimal surrounding glow. Unlike conventional depictions where a moon is usually surrounded by light rays or a halo, this structure lacks such effects, indicating a flat, graphic style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plants in Image B are stylized with repetitive and consistent patterns, lacking the variation typical of natural growth. This style shows symmetry and order indicative of patterned arrangements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows are represented through thick lines and bold, angular shapes. The design emphasizes dynamic geometric features characteristic of graphic style enhancements rather than subtle or delicate detailing.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a clear Art Deco influence through its use of flat, graphic qualities, symmetry, angular lines, and strong decorative elements. The design choices align with Art Deco's emphasis on geometric patterns and stylized representations.",
