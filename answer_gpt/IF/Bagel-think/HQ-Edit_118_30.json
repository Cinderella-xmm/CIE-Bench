      "question": "Are the train cars depicted as large, colorful, interlocking blocks rather than realistic carriages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train cars are visually represented using large, colorful blocks with visible puzzle-like interlocking sections instead of realistic train carriages. This can be identified from the bright colors and uniform blocky structure typical of puzzle pieces. Thus, rather than showing realistic features like windows and details typical of real train carriages, they resemble simplified and stylized puzzle blocks.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke is depicted as swirling forms composed of colored puzzle pieces, rather than representing a realistic cloud of steam. These swirling shapes are made with segmented, colored sections indicating their construction from puzzle pieces rather than the natural, free-form clouds of steam.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the countryside landscape is not present as it was transformed into a background composed of geometric patterns and vibrant puzzle pieces instead. The specific patterns manifest as organized blocks and shapes, typical of puzzles, replacing the realistic depiction of fields and hills with angular and grid-like patterns.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no detailed human figures depicted. Instead, small puzzle pieces appear which contain images and features that suggest human elements, transforming them into simplified representations of individuals in a puzzle format with features resembling vintage clothing styles but not as actual figures.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle scene is set against a backdrop that appears as a light-colored wooden surface. The edges of the puzzle and the wooden texture with visible grain serves as a clear background to the assembled puzzle, indicating that it sits on a light-colored wooden tabletop.",
