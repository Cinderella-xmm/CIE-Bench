    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the object now a tall, rectangular glass vessel instead of a soft-sided suitcase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an object that has the characteristics of a tall, rectangular glass vessel. The object appears transparent and has straight edges, typical of a glass container, unlike a fabric suitcase which is opaque and has soft, rounded edges. This change in appearance indicates that the object is now a glass vessel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the retractable handle been transformed into a metallic spray nozzle positioned at the top of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top part of the object features a distinct spray nozzle, which is characteristic of bottles or dispensers, rather than a suitcase handle. The spray nozzle is typically seen in containers designed for dispensing liquids, supporting that the handle has been transformed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the side and front panels now made of translucent purple-tinted material instead of fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is made of a translucent material with a purple tint. Glass is commonly used in bottles and vessels to allow visibility inside, and the purple tint adds a decorative feature. This contrasts with the fabric material of a suitcase, indicating a transformation in the material composition.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original seam lines preserved as embossed linear patterns on the surface of the vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any visible seam lines or embossed patterns that would suggest the preservation of original seam lines from a suitcase. Glass vessels typically have smooth surfaces without visible seam lines similar to those on fabric luggage.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a logo visible near the top of the vessel, which appears to be etched or printed onto the surface. Such branding is typical on glass vessels or bottles, distinguishing their identity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any wheels or components resembling wheels. Instead, the base appears flat, typical for bottles designed to stand upright. There are no visible decorative caps that replace wheel functionality.",
