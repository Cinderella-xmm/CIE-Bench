      "question": "Is the bow depicted as a folded origami paper design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow appears to have angular and geometric features, along with clear creases and folded patterns characteristic of origami paper designs. These visual cues align with common knowledge of origami, which consists of sharp angles and facet-like surfaces. Therefore, observing the distinct folded appearance of the bow supports the conclusion that it is crafted in an origami paper style.",

      "question": "Are the arrows in the quiver depicted as folded origami paper designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrows, along with the quiver, display angular, geometric shapes with visible creases that are typical of origami creations. This origami-like detailing, with clearly defined paper-like facets, leads to the conclusion that the arrows are designed with a folded origami paper look rather than traditional materials.",

      "question": "Does the woodland backdrop retain its natural appearance without any artificial alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woodland setting maintains a natural look with typical forest floor textures and lighting similar to a natural environment. There are no apparent origami-like features or artificial modifications in the backdrop itself, suggesting it retains its natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall composition and positioning of the bow and quiver remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, both images show the bow and quiver positioned similarly relative to each other and the backdrop. Despite the change in material appearance, the composition and arrangement of these objects have not been altered.",

      "question": "Do the bow and quiver show clear paper folds and lack realistic material textures such as wood or leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual evidence shows that the bow and quiver have distinct paper folds with visible edge lines, which are typical for origami. They lack the realistic textures of materials like wood or leather seen in Image A, reinforcing that the design has an origami aesthetic.",
