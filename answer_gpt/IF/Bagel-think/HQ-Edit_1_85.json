    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a series of separate postcard-sized panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual appearance of separate sections which resemble smaller panels divides the image. These sections are aligned side by side like pages, suggesting a postcard style arrangement. The presence of borders that frame the image further reinforce this impression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the girl’s blouse feature intricate lace details rendered in a paper-cut style with sharp, layered edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the blouse's lace details are stylized with distinct, angular lines and shaded patterns akin to paper-cut art. Such sharp delineation offers a layered look as if cut from paper.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the violin been enlarged in size relative to the girl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the violin compared to the girl's arm and torso appear to be standard for a typical violin relative to the player's size, consistent with a normal relationship seen in professional settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the girl’s pose show an enhanced sense of musical expression through refined hand placement, posture, or facial focus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture and hand placement of the girl appear rigid and schematic, reflecting a stylized illustration. While visually appealing, the expression does not convey an enhanced musical expression typically characterized by dynamic posture and engagement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image have a visual appearance consistent with being printed on textured cream stock (e.g., warm off-white tone, soft matte finish)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall tone and presentation of Image B, characterized by its warm sepia colors and muted features, mimic the aesthetic of a print on cream stock paper. The depiction has a tactile appearance appropriate for paper with such qualities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the back sides of the postcards illustrated with blank music sheet motifs suitable for writing notes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, part of the illustration presents musical sheet motifs typically found on music scores. While not explicitly blank for note-taking, the suggestion of music sheets fits the concept of enhancing the backside design for musical-themed postcards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
