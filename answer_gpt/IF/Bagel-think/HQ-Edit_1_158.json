        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear border lines and decorative corners present around the main figure, which give the image a card-like appearance. These elements help to contextualize the figure against a backdrop that mimics the look of a mounted card.
