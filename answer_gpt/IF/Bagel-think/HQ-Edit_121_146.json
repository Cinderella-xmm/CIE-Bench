      "question": "Is the central body of the object now a transparent glass chamber suitable for holding a candle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the main body of the object is clearly transparent and reveals a lit candle inside, which indicates the structure is now a glass chamber suitable for holding a candle. Combining common sense, it's evident that the shape and transparency of the central body facilitate this function.",

      "question": "Are the floral motifs now rendered in embossed gold detail around the glass chamber?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral motifs are visible around the glass chamber, and they appear to be embossed. However, they do not exhibit a gold finish; rather, they have a metallic or silver appearance. Common sense and visual cues suggest these motifs, while ornate, are not gold.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the glass chamber exhibit a rich camel red hue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass chamber is transparent with a candle visible inside, casting a warm, inviting glow. The hue appears more amber or orange, typical from the candle flame, rather than camel red as described. Observing the visual cue leads to the understanding that the hue is a product of light from the candle.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a polished wooden lid present that mimics the contour of the original teapotâ€™s handle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows a wooden lid with a spherical top resembling the traditional teapot lid, although it doesn't mimic the contour of the handle, which remains in a classic teapot shape. World knowledge of teapot designs supports understanding the function and similarity without mimicry.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B indicates that there is no visible brand logo prominently displayed on the base of the glass chamber candle holder. The base design is ornate but does not include any identifiable marking that would be presumed as a brand logo.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is vividly patterned with a fabric showcasing rich, ornate patterns that resemble luxury items often used in interior decorations. Comparing against typical visual characteristics associated with luxury, the fabric fulfills the criteria of appearing luxurious based on its intricate pattern and color.",
