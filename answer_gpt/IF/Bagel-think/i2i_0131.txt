    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image include the front, left side, and top views of both refrigerators?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we see one refrigerator facing forward. The side view and top view are not visible, as the refrigerator is built into cabinetry that obscures these views. Common sense tells us that viewing angles are limited when an object is recessed into a structure, especially for appliances like refrigerators. Given these observations, the image doesn't include left side or top views.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the refrigerators displayed in a way that allows viewers to see detailed features clearly, making the image appropriate for e-commerce or instructional purposes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator is placed in built-in cabinetry with only the front visible. Features like the door handles, water dispenser, and general finish are clearly visible, suggesting it is effectively displayed for viewers interested in its design and functionality. For e-commerce or instructional purposes, seeing the front is often sufficient to display such features. Hence, this presentation is appropriate for those purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the combined views maintained the original proportions and design details of the refrigerators without distortion?",
    "explanation": "Without needing to compare to Image A, we can assess Image B on its own. The refrigerator in Image B is displayed with a realistic perspective, matching common proportions and maintaining design details such as handle size, finish, and dispenser layout. The lack of distortion is apparent because household items like refrigerators usually match standardized visual portrayals, and no obvious visual disparities suggest distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the image free of irrelevant or distracting elements, focusing solely on the refrigerators and their features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is entirely on the refrigerator. The surrounding cabinetry and minor elements like a plant are standard in kitchen settings and don't distract from the primary subject, the appliance. Therefore, the image remains focused on its intended focal point - the refrigerator in the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image maintain sufficient resolution and clarity to serve as a professional product display for e-commerce or installation manuals?",
    "explanation": "Image B is sharp and the refrigerator's features are clearly visible, suggesting a high-resolution that would be suitable for professional purposes. For e-commerce or installation manuals, clarity in viewing the appliance's details is crucial, which Image B provides. This assumption is supported by the clean presentation and visible details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
