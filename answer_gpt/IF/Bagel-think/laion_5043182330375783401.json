      "question": "Is the overall composition stylized with strong geometric lines, symmetry, and decorative elements typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases strong geometric lines and symmetry typical of Art Deco design.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suitâ€™s contours replaced with bold, angular geometric shapes in metallic silver and blue colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit is represented with angular geometric shapes and uses metallic silver and blue colors. These shapes replace the traditional fabric contours with more stylized, bold shapes typical of a geometric and modern artistic rendition, signifying a shift from naturalism to a more abstract portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chair feature sleek, linear, or repeating decorative patterns consistent with Art Deco streamlining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is not visibly outlined which prevents the analysis of specific decorative patterns or elements' consistency with Art Deco streamlining. The focus is more on the figure and the background instead of specific furniture elements, making it challenging to attribute such design characteristics to the chair.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a gradient transitioning through warm sunset colors such as orange, red, and purple?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background prominently showcasing warm sunset colors, including a vivid gradient of orange and red. This creates an atmospheric, vibrant backdrop typical of sunset hues, adding depth and contrast to the rest of the stylized image. However, the presence of purple is less evident.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B maintains the original seated pose with arms crossed similar to Image A. However, the facial features such as mustache and closed eyes are not depicted, as the design style opts for a more abstract and stylized representation, concentrating on geometric and color elements rather than detailed facial characteristics.",
