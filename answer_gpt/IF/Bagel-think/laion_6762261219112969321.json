      "question": "Has the overall shape of the sofa been transformed into a fantastical cloud creature with plush, pillow-like formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a fantastical creature resembling clouds composed of multiple spherical formations, which gives a soft, plush appearance. These formations are characteristic of cloud-like creatures, contrasting with the structured and defined shape of a sofa. The edited image effectively alters the appearance of the sofa into this whimsical creature form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the leather texture been replaced with soft, swirling cloud-like textures throughout the cushioned areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture resembles soft clouds with spherical forms, which are characteristic of swirling cloud formations. This texture is distinctly different from leather, as leather typically appears smooth and defined. The edited image has successfully replaced the leather texture with cloud-like characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the wooden legs and armrests been transformed into branching, wind-like structures that resemble gusts of air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible wooden elements resembling legs or armrests. Instead, the creature’s structure is entirely cloud-like without any solid, defined components similar to wood. This indicates that the transformation focused on cloud formations, not attempting to mimic wind-like structures from previous solid wood elements.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there whimsical eyes visibly placed on the cushions of the cloud creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fantastical creature with clearly visible whimsical eyes that are placed among the cloud-like bubbles and formations. These eyes add character and personality to the creature, distinguishing it from the previous object’s non-descript functional nature as a sofa.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flowing mist trail extending from the back of the cloud creature, giving the impression of ethereal flight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows a mist trail extending from the back of the cloud creature, appearing as a sequence of smaller cloud-like formations. This addition creates an impression of movement and a sense of ethereal flight that was not present in the original static form of a sofa.",
