      "question": "Has the food been rearranged into a Michelin-style plating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a piece of steak and a small pile of what appears to be chopped carrots on a large white plate. Michelin-style plating often involves artistic presentation, including elements like saucing, garnishes, and creative arrangement. The presentation in Image B is simplistic and does not exhibit the complexity and creativity expected from Michelin-level presentations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the steak spiral-rolled?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steak is presented as a single, flat piece with a focus on its surface texture and cooked center. A spiral-rolled steak would appear rolled or coiled, which is not evident in this image. The steak's appearance suggests standard cooking and presentation methods rather than spiral rolling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the carrots cut into a fan-shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the carrots are shown as a small pile on the plate, appearing to be roughly chopped or diced rather than arranged or sliced into a fan shape. A fan shape would generally involve pieces cut and arranged in a deliberate, radiating pattern, which is not visible here.",

      "question": "Have sauce dots been added to each vegetable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible sauce dots on or around the vegetables (carrots) in Image B. Sauce dots typically appear as small, intentional placements of sauce around or on the food. There is no sign of any such addition in the image.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question": "Is the food served on a large white ceramic plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steak and carrots are clearly placed on a large, round, white plate. The plate is simple and ceramic in appearance, fitting the description of a large white ceramic plate.",
