      "question": "Does the image feature warm tones and soft lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed with multiple elements like skill bars and a nameplate, which are usually presented in a cohesive and polished style. The frame uses a vibrant purple background, which is not typically associated with warm tones, and the lighting does not suggest softness; instead, it has a more digital or gamified appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are programmer-related tools or icons, such as code fragments or keyboards, included in the artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design includes skill bars suggesting attributes or skills, but does not visually represent programmer-specific tools or icons such as code fragments or keyboards. The focus is more on character and attribute presentation rather than specific programming elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are stats like [Coding +10] and [Creativity +8] represented as skill bars in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features skill bars with ambiguous names like 'Aniork' and 'Rtetecte'. These do not explicitly correspond to stats like [Coding +10] and [Creativity +8], indicating that while skills are represented, they are not directly related to coding or creativity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a title banner at the top and a nameplate at the bottom, both framed with crisp, polished borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a nameplate at the bottom displaying 'Caareal Pisske', which indicates some form of identity or character description, framed with polished borders. Although there's not a title banner at the top, the structured presentation suggests an organized design typically seen in game profiles or character sheets.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background use shades that complement the purple and black color scheme of the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background is a deep blue, which complements the purple hair by providing contrast while remaining within a similar color family. This ensures that the character maintains a visually appealing and cohesive color scheme with the purple hair and black outfit.",
