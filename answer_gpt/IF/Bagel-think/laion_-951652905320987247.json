      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible glass terrarium structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible indication of a glass terrarium structure surrounding the scene. The boundaries of the image do not display any reflective surfaces, framing, or other elements typical of a glass terrarium. Without visual cues such as reflections or a glass border, it is reasonable to conclude that the scene is not enclosed within such a structure.",

      "question": "Are the snow-capped peaks made of visibly textured and glittering materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the snow-capped peaks with a heightened visual style that suggests texture and a shimmering quality. The surface of the peaks appears to have an artificial texture and a sparkle that could be interpreted as glittering. This stylized representation deviates from natural snow and indicates a textured and glittering material appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the landscape feature intricately detailed, fine-brushed foliage instead of natural-looking vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage appears more stylized and artificial, resembling fine-brushed art rather than natural vegetation. Each tree and bush seems to have distinct, exaggerated textures and colors, contributing to the perception of an intricately detailed, artistic representation rather than realistic foliage.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lake represented by a reflective, translucent resin-like surface with a synthetic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B reflects the surrounding elements with an exaggerated clarity and sheen, resembling how light plays off a smooth, synthetic surface like resin. The reflection is sharper and more defined than typical water reflections, suggesting a more manufactured appearance. This suggests a resin-like quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed chalet figurines placed along the shoreline of the lake?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the shoreline, there are small structures resembling chalet-like buildings. These appear to be well-defined and detailed, similar to figurines rather than actual buildings. The size and style are consistent with decorative miniatures.",
