      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the buildings in the skyline rendered with pixel-patterned or grid-like luminous facades resembling a digital display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings have facades that appear to have a pixel-patterned or grid-like luminous design. The visual effect of tiny, illuminated squares on the buildings resembles digital displays, which are often characterized by similar patterns. This suggests a cybernetic or digital aesthetic applied to the structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings exhibit a glowing or luminescent effect, such as bright edges, internal illumination, or radiant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows buildings with bright, glowing edges and internal illumination. The vibrant colors and luminescent outlines give the impression that the buildings are emitting light themselves, enhancing the overall futuristic feel of the scene. This glow persists across the structures, amplifying their visibility and evoking a cybernetic design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the trees been replaced with glowing, angular, circuit-like structures composed of lines and nodes resembling digital pathways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B displays alterations to the colors and vibes of the environment, the trees retain their organic shapes, showing a mix of vibrant lighting effects rather than circuit-like structures. Despite their enhanced and neon-infused appearance, they do not fully transform into angular, circuit-like entities, staying closer to natural tree forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bridge illuminated with vibrant neon lights along its structure, creating a glowing pathway effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridge in Image B displays a noticeable neon effect, suggesting vibrant lighting along its structure. This manipulation gives the impression of a glowing pathway, consistent with neon-lit designs that are common in futuristic and cybernetic aesthetics. The use of bright colors enhances this glowing visual effect.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene consistently feature futuristic technology aesthetics, such as digital patterns, glowing elements, and cybernetic design features across buildings, trees, and infrastructure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B overall showcases a futuristic aesthetic, especially noticeable across the buildings and bridge. Key elements such as digital patterns and glowing features are prominently applied. Although the trees sustain a partial transformation with vibrant colors, the encompassing glow across all major visual components sustains a cybernetic theme, presenting a scenario embellished with futuristic technology aesthetics.",
