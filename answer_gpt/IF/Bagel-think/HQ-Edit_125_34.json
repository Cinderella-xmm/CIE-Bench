      "question": "Are brass gears and levers visibly integrated into the desk surface or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk features visible elements that appear to be brass gears and levers. These are integrated into the structure and surface of the desk, which aligns with common elements of steampunk design, known for incorporating mechanical components and aged metallic aesthetics. The presence of these features suggests an enhancement over a traditional desk to give it a more industrial and mechanical appearance.",

      "question": "Do the books in the image emit a visible glow and contain mechanical bookmarks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, some of the books appear to have a faint, bluish glow. This visual cue suggests that they have been modified or enhanced beyond their traditional appearance, possibly incorporating some steampunk or mechanical elements. However, there is no clear indication of mechanical bookmarks sticking out, just the glow on some books.",

      "question": "Is the globe on the screen replaced with a floating, translucent 3D holographic model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a floating, translucent 3D holographic model of a globe is visible above the desk, indicating a shift from the 2D display seen in common screens to a more advanced, futuristic representation. This kind of holographic display is consistent with speculative steampunk technology, which often combines Victorian style with futuristic, science fiction elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window frames in Image B do not exhibit bold, intricate patterns that would typify a steampunk design, such as added brass detailing or visible mechanical motifs. The frames maintain a more traditional appearance without substantial embellishments or added mechanical features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no visible text or label present that names the image 'The Time Traveler's Study' in any font, let alone one that would be stylized for a steampunk aesthetic. If such a label is present, it is not visibly evident in the image.",
