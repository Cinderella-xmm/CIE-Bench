    "Question": "Q2: Does the right-side skier cast a shadow that suggests depth and closeness to the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right casts a distinct shadow on the snow. The sharpness of the shadow indicates the skier's proximity to the snow surface, suggesting a sense of depth and closeness to the viewer. The shadow's clarity and position relative to the skier often contribute to the perception of spatial depth.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there motion lines or blurring effects around the edges of the right-side skier to simulate movement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is evident blurring around the edges of the right-side skier. This technique simulates motion, commonly used to depict fast-paced action in images. The blur suggests that the skier is moving quickly downhill, contributing to the dynamic feeling of motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the right-side skier been repositioned to appear significantly closer to the viewer than any other objects in the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier is prominently positioned with blurring effects indicating movement, making them appear closer to the viewer. The skier's size relative to other elements, the angle, and motion blur suggest the skier's proximity to the viewer. Image B differs from Image A, where the skier is less prominent and lacks such effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the right-side skier positioned at an angle that simulates leaning forward or moving closer toward the viewer?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier appears to lean forward, indicated by their body orientation and the direction of motion blur. This positioning suggests the skier is moving quickly towards the viewer, enhanced by the tilt of the body and skis. This detail contributes to the perception of the skier coming closer to the observer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
