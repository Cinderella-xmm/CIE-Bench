      "question": "Is the cactus transformed into a creature-like form with distinct features such as a face, body, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a notable transformation is evident where the cactus is altered significantly to resemble a creature. The edited image in Image B features a character with large, gemstone-like eyes, a defined body with scales and distinct limbs, and a somber expression. The cactus shape in Image A is replaced with these anthropomorphic features that convey a creature-like quality.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the creature’s scales feature patterns and colors matching those on the sombrero’s brim, such as floral and geometric designs in vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature portrays a vibrant, scale-like texture on its body which is colorful and detailed. These scales are distinctly colored in shades of green and gold but lack the specific floral and geometric designs found on the sombrero’s brim, which includes colorful patterns typical of traditional Mexican embroidery. Therefore, the patterns on the scales do not pattern-match the brim designs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terracotta pot seen in Image A is replaced by a stone-like base upon which the creature stands. Instead of a regular pot, Image B shows a rocky structure that serves as the foundational support beneath the creature, assuming the stylistic form of the creature’s base.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals that the original spines of the cactus in Image A have been transformed into quill-like appendages on the creature. These quills have a metallic, reflective quality, illustrating a luminous effect with golden hues, contrary to the reddish spines of the original cactus.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no obvious sand-looking aura or particle-like texture surrounding the creature. The image features a stable and clear background amidst a desert view, without any sandy or dust-like motion visible around the creature itself.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted with large, round eyes that are gemstone-like in appearance and exhibit a bright, reflective quality. The coloration gives a topaz-like impression, displaying a watchful and serene expression, differentiating from the plain surface in Image A.",
