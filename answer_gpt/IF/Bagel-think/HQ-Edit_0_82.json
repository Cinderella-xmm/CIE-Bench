      "question": "Is the elderly man depicted using a subtle line-art style with visible outlines that define his form and tai chi posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is represented with a line-art style where his form and tai chi posture are defined by outlines. This style is characterized by using clear, continuous lines to depict figures and their motions. Unlike naturalistic depictions that rely on shading and color gradients, line-art focuses on the structure and contours of the subject. The man's pose in Image B is outlined in this way, emphasizing the posture without intricate details.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Do the individual cells in the date grid reflect or mirror the balanced posture of the tai chi stance in their shape or arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The date grid in Image B does not imitate or reflect the tai chi stance directly in its shape or arrangement. While both elements share a theme of balance and order, the grid itself uses a standard, consistent rectangular arrangement typical for calendars, which contrasts with the dynamic and balanced posture of the tai chi stance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B strongly conveys a Zen-like atmosphere. This is achieved through minimalistic design elements, such as the simple line-art depiction of the elderly man and the sparse arrangement of the date grid.
