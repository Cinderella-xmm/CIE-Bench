    "Question": "Q2: Are the kimono patterns composed of flowing, curvilinear organic designs such as vines or flowers, rendered in vivid jewel tones (e.g., deep reds, blues, greens)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono of the geisha does not feature flowing, organic designs typical of vines or flowers. Instead, the colors are separated into solid blocks due to the stained glass effect, and there are no intricate patterns like vines or flowers that one would expect to see in traditional kimono art rendered with jewel tones. Therefore, Image B lacks these curvilinear organic designs.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the background composed of curving, interwoven lines and shaded areas forming an abstract mosaic pattern consistent with Art Nouveau design?",
