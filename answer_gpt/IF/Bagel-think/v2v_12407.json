      "question": "Is the mango depicted with visible pixelation characteristic of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is rendered in a style that is reminiscent of 8-bit graphics. This is deduced from the distinct pixelation visible on the mango, where individual pixels can be clearly seen, creating a blocky appearance. 8-bit graphics are known for such a low-resolution style with visible pixels, commonly found in early video games. This graphic style doesn't provide smooth edges, leading to the choppy, pixelated lines that are evident in the depiction of the mango.",

      "question": "Are the table and napkin rendered with a simplified, low-resolution appearance consistent with 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table and napkin in Image B appear to have a pixelated, low-resolution look, typical of 8-bit graphics. In such graphics, colors and patterns are represented in stark, blocky pixels without fine details. The napkin is essentially a collection of larger squares, and the table has bold, blunt lines instead of gradients and textures. This appearance is due to the 8-bit graphic style's inherent limitations in resolution and detail rendering.",

      "question": "Does the image utilize a limited color palette typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are simple and distinct, without smooth transitions, which indicates the use of a limited color palette. 8-bit graphics are usually characterized by a restricted set of colors due to technical constraints, often leading to bright, vivid hues. In this image, the colors are flat and contrast sharply with one another, consistent with the reduced color depth typical of 8-bit graphics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are shadows and highlights on the mango and table simplified to match the flat shading typical of 8-bit graphics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and highlights in Image B are indeed simplified. On the mango and the table, shading is not continuous or gradient but rather composed of discrete, flat color regions. This is a hallmark of 8-bit graphics, where limited color palettes and resolution result in blocky and abrupt changes in shading, without the nuanced gradients seen in higher-resolution images.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image simplified, focusing on basic shapes and forms rather than detailed textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an overall composition that focuses on basic shapes and forms, characteristic of 8-bit graphics, which inherently lack detailed textures due to their resolution restrictions. The mango, napkin, and table are represented using simple geometric forms with flat colors and no intricate detailing, aligning with the simplified style aimed at capturing the essence of the subject with minimal complexity.",
