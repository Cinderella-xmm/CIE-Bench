    "Question": "Q5: Does the backdrop include a circular window offering a view of a cozy, tech-inspired room bathed in soft, warm lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the monitor screen itself features an image of a cozy room with soft, warm lighting and technological elements such as a computer setup, but there isn't a circular window in the box.
