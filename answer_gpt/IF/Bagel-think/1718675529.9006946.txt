    "Question": "Q1: Is the image rendered in a stylized, graphic manner consistent with Art Deco design principles, rather than a photorealistic style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the approach to rendering is characterized by the use of bold lines, geometric shapes, and a reduced color palette, which are hallmarks of the Art Deco style. Compared to a photorealistic image, which would depict scenes with natural colors, textures, and details, the edited image simplifies forms and uses abstract shapes to define elements like waves and landscapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the ocean waves represented using bold, simplified geometric curves instead of naturalistic wave forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean waves are depicted with bold, sweeping curves that divide the ocean into distinct layered sections. These lines are consistent with a stylized approach rather than the complex, irregular shapes seen in natural wave forms. Geometric simplification is a characteristic trait used to convey movement and forms in a stylized graphic manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the palm trees depicted as stylized vertical lines without detailed fronds or natural tree structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows palm trees as minimalistic, stylized forms. They appear as simple vertical lines with minimal indication of foliage. This abstraction removes the intricate details like fronds, aligning with a more graphic representation rather than a realistic one.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the clouds in the sky rendered as symmetrical, geometric shapes rather than natural cloud forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are represented by geometric shapes which are symmetrical and abstract. Unlike the irregular, soft-edged forms of real clouds, these shapes are highly stylized and help reinforce the graphic design style of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the image use a color palette dominated by muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, avoiding bright or highly saturated colors?",
    "explanation": "The color palette in Image B consists of muted tones of green, blue, and warm orange hues. This choice keeps the colors subdued rather than vibrant, contributing to the stylized effect while using contrasting yet harmonious tones typical of Art Deco inspiration rather than a natural or photorealistic color scheme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the essential elements of the beach scene—sand, ocean, horizon, and sky—still present and recognizable despite the stylization?",
    "explanation": "Even though Image B employs a stylized representation, it retains recognizable elements of a beach scene. The sand is indicated by flat areas separated by geometric curves for the ocean, while the horizon and sky are still discernible despite the abstract rendering. These elements remain identifiable regardless of the simplified graphic treatment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
