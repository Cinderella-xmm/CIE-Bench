    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Great Wall and surrounding mountains rendered as a miniature 3D model rather than a full-scale photograph?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Great Wall and surrounding mountains appear to be part of a small, detailed model. The texture and appearance suggest a crafted, miniature representation, not a real-life scene typical of a photograph. This is evident from the stylized design and distinct separation in components often seen in models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [

        "Yes",
        "No"
