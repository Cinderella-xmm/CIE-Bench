      "question": "Do the zebras appear as charming chibi-style 3D figures with oversized, adorable traits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are depicted as 3D figures with exaggerated features such as large eyes and proportionally larger heads and smaller bodies, which are typical traits of chibi-style representations. This gives them a cute and adorable look, often used in animated or toy-like artistic renditions.",

      "question": "Do the zebras retain their signature striped coats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the chibi-style depiction, the zebras have maintained their characteristic black and white striped patterns. This visual cue is critical for identifying them as zebras, even in a stylized form.",

      "question": "Are the zebras shown in realistic grazing stances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the zebras in a stylized manner, and although they are depicted bending down similar to a grazing posture, the style is more illustrative and not meant to be realistic. The focus is more on the cute and cartoonish representation rather than capturing realistic animal behavior.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background, including the field and fencing, is rendered in a more illustrative, cartoon-like manner rather than a photorealistic style. It complements the chibi-style zebras with simple shapes and bright colors.",
