      "question": "Has the text \"flyaway\" been added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of the word 'flyaway' in stylized text over the edited image (Image B) suggests this text was not part of the original decor. It seems additional and intentional, likely added during the editing process as it isn't a typical feature in a room design without specific thematic intent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text “flyaway” written in a handwritten font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'flyaway' in Image B appears to have a flowing, cursive style characteristic of handwriting. The smooth curves and connections between letters typical of handwritten fonts suggest it was styled in this way rather than using a standard printed font.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"flyaway\" located directly below the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'flyaway' is visually placed beneath the painting, above the wooden cabinet, and centered within the lower quadrant of the image. This strategic positioning ensures it draws attention without overlapping or being on top of other elements like the furniture or decor, which indicates its placement is directly below the painting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the text \"flyaway\" complement the scene and contribute to a romantic postcard-style appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten style of the text 'flyaway' along with the serene landscape painting and minimalist room setting in Image B create a visual harmony reminiscent of a curated or thematic visual, similar to a postcard. This design choice typically evokes a sense of romance or tranquility, characteristic of a postcard appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No\n```",
      "explanation": "Other than the text 'flyaway,' Image B does not display any other adjustments or changes when compared to what is implied by the original setting's decor and layout. The remaining elements such as furniture and decor retain their original portrayal.",
