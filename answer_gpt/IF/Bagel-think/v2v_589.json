      "question": "Are there exactly five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three chibi-style Russian nesting dolls. This is evident from the arrangement on the wooden platform where three distinct doll figures are clearly visible. By recognizing typical nesting doll sets, usually involving varied quantities, the observation of three dolls leads to the conclusion that there are not five dolls in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls exhibit a vibrant lime-green color and texture similar to the shoe and tennis ball in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in Image B indeed showcase a vibrant lime-green color that closely resembles the hue of the shoe and tennis ball in Image A. The texture attributes of the dolls also mirror those of a tennis ball, suggesting a shared design characteristic, identifiable by their surface detailing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls organized from largest to smallest in size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits an arrangement where the nesting dolls are lined up in descending order, from largest to smallest. This can be discerned based on visual observation of their relative sizes when aligned on the wooden platform.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls positioned on a sophisticated wooden table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the three nesting dolls placed on a simplistic wooden stand or platform rather than a sophisticated wooden table. The simplicity of the layout, without any sign of elaborate or polished design, leads to understanding it as a straightforward wooden platform.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is characterized by a plain, muted color, which does not draw attention away from the nesting dolls, hence it is considered subtle and non-distracting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the proportions visible in Image B, the photo appears to have more of a square format rather than a 3:2 aspect ratio. The width and height visual cues point towards equal dimensions rather than one being notably longer, indicative of a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio.",
