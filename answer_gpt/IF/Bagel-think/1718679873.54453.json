    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the robot now a miniature 3D articulated model instead of a full-sized giant robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is displayed on a stand that suggests it's a model rather than a full-sized machine. Details such as the diminutive scale compared to the tree models and the fact that it's part of an organized display setting strongly indicate a miniature model, unlike the vast landscape of Image A where the robot's scale dominates the environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robot enclosed within a circular display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot surrounded by a circular frame which appears to be part of the display setup. This implies that it is designed to look like a display case, although it may not be fully enclosed. The shape and positioning suggest a showcase style which contrasts with the open environment of Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible tiny gears under transparent panels on the robot’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot exhibits intricate details that suggest mechanical complexity but there are no transparent panels showing visible gears. The details are visually complex, resembling gears, but they are not shown under transparency indicating direct visibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display positioned on a hexagonal black base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts the robot model standing on a hexagonal black base. This contrasts with Image A, where there is no such base visible, only the natural environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the robot’s model number etched in a luminous silver font on the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B features the text 'EKCOCIF' in a luminous font. The use of glow suggests an etched style commonly used for model descriptions or branding, similar to the practice of highlighting key details on display bases.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a miniaturized landscape around the display that reflects the original scene’s elements (e.g., trees, terrain, distant city)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surrounding the model robot, there is a miniaturized landscape which includes trees and a terrain similar to those in Image A. This setup suggests an intention to replicate features of the original scene, albeit in a miniature form, while Image A features these elements as part of a real-world landscape.",
