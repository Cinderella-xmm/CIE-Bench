      "question": "Has the church been rendered in a semi-cartoon style with simplified shapes and stylized lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is depicted with bold and stylized lines, simplified shapes, and an absence of fine detail, typical characteristics of a semi-cartoon style. The exaggerated lines and vibrant colors also contribute to this aesthetic. This analysis is based solely on visual cues present in Image B, without comparing it to Image A.",

      "question": "Are the architectural elements of the church perfectly symmetrical on both sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church features symmetrical spires and arches on either side of the central section, which appear mirrored and balanced. Each side has a similar arrangement of windows and structural features, indicating symmetry. This analysis does not require a comparison with Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic gold accents applied specifically to the spires and upper parts of the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows golden hues applied to the tips of the spires and the upper sections of the church. The shimmering quality suggests a stylized metallic effect, which enhances the visual impact and emphasizes specific architectural features. This conclusion is drawn from the visual depiction in Image B, without needing to refer to Image A.",

      "question": "Has the proportion of the church been altered to enhance its sense of grandeur and scale?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is illustrated with exaggerated proportions, particularly in its height and spire length, which gives it an imposing and grand appearance. This stylized portrayal conveys a sense of larger-than-life scale. The assessment focuses on the visual impression in Image B, independently from Image A.",

      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a celestial-themed design featuring elements like stars, galaxies, or cosmic hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's background includes elements such as stars and moons set against a deep blue sky, creating a celestial theme. These design components suggest an otherworldly or cosmic atmosphere, consistent with a celestial motif. This evaluation does not involve comparison with Image A, relying solely on the visual cues in Image B.",

      "question": "Are there three separate architectural art prints displayed, each within a matte black frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a singular art print of the church framed in a matte black, resembling a book or album cover rather than multiple prints. There are no visual indications of three separate prints, only a single artwork contained within the frame. This conclusion derives from analyzing visual information evident in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the three prints arranged in a trifold album format, with a central fold and two outer panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a single framed artwork, which appears to be part of a book rather than a trifold album. There are no distinct panels or central folds visible that would suggest a trifold arrangement of three prints. The analysis is concentrated on the observed characteristics present in Image B.",
