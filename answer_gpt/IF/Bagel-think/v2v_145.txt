    "Question": "Q1: Has the mango been transformed into a whimsical figurine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango retains its shape and appears like sliced cubes. However, it exhibits a smoother, less natural texture, resembling a stylized or animated form commonly seen in digital art or whimsical representations. Therefore, combining this styling with world knowledge can make one perceive it as a whimsical interpretation rather than a regular mango.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Have the cut mango pieces been slightly increased in size?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango pieces visually appear larger compared to typical mango cube sizes. This observation comes from the relative size these pieces occupy on the fruit, coupled with their exaggerated blocky, almost cartoonish geometry, suggesting that the pieces have indeed been increased in size compared to what is natural.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the mango pieces have a shiny 3D effect?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the mango pieces with a high-gloss finish and defined edges, contributing to a shiny 3D appearance often used to give objects a more polished, digital art style. This visual cue closely aligns with graphic design trends which utilize bright reflections to create depth, signaling the presence of a 3D effect.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire setup positioned on a shelf?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the setup including the mango, lime, and chili powder, is displayed on a plate, which appears to rest on a flat, light-colored surface that lacks detailed context or background characteristic of a shelf visualization. Shelves typically show some structural elements in the background or sides, which are absent here, supporting the perception that it is not on a shelf.",
