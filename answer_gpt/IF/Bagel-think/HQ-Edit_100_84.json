      "question": "Is the text \"Mystic Arabian Dhow Journeys\" visible in the image as a title element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text that appears as a title element on the top of the image reads 'MOITIAL MINOCS.' There is no mention or appearance of the phrase 'Mystic Arabian Dhow Journeys.' Therefore, based on the visible text, the answer is that the required text is not present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible intricate Middle Eastern decorative patterns (such as arabesques, geometric designs, or calligraphy) on the dhow boat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the dhow boat decorated with complex patterns that resemble Middle Eastern designs. These include geometric shapes and potentially stylized elements resembling calligraphy, which are indicative of traditional Arabian artistic styles. Therefore, such intricate decorative patterns are visible.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there mythical sea creatures (e.g., mermaids, sea serpents, or winged fish) with delicate, detailed features visible around the dhow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are fish depicted around the dhow boat, but they resemble regular fish rather than mythical creatures like mermaids or sea serpents. These fish have simple designs without elaborate or mythical features. Hence, no mythical sea creatures with detailed features are visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are rich blue tones (in water and sky) and golden hues (in sails, light, and decorations) prominently used to create a strong visual contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a vivid utilization of blue tones for the water and sky, complemented by golden hues on the sails and decorations. This combination creates a vibrant and eye-catching contrast, indicating the intentional use of these colors for a visual impact. Therefore, the image prominently uses these colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the distant sailboats in the background rendered as simple, dark silhouettes without visible sails or structural detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sailboats visible in the background are portrayed as silhouettes. However, contrary to Image A where distant sailboats were rendered simply, the silhouettes in Image B are part of a more illustrated style, leading to a distinct rendering. Therefore, while silhouetting is present, simplicity without visible sails or structural detail is not consistent with the style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a faint, shimmering Arabian-style skyline mirage with geometric patterns visible along the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an indistinct skyline with shapes against the horizon line. Some of these include geometric forms, which resemble a style that might be inspired by Arabian architecture or mirage-like effects. However, they are not explicitly detailed or patterned. Nonetheless, there is an attempt to create such a visual, hence its presence is subtle.",
