    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a holographic projection screen added to the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an additional element on top of the sandwich, which resembles a digital overlay with distinctive grid lines common in animated depictions of holograms. This visual cue matches the common depiction of a holographic projection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection appear to emerge from the man's phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic projection in Image B seems to originate around the middle section of the sandwich, where no phone or hand is visible. Without a phone in the image, it cannot be concluded that the hologram is emerging from a phone.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen display a city map interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added holographic element in Image B contains grid patterns and lines that are structured in a manner akin to a city map, showing sections and possible routes, which strongly suggests it is meant to depict a map interface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the holographic projection screen designed in a futuristic and transparent style characteristic of sci-fi elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic element in Image B has a translucent design with grid lines that are consistent with futuristic and sci-fi representations of technology such as transparent screens, suggesting a sci-fi style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A (original) to Image B (edited), the primary alteration is the addition of the holographic screen. Besides this intentional edit, the rest of Image B, including the sandwich and the knife, remains unchanged, maintaining consistency with Image A.",
