      "question": "Has the image been transformed into a vintage detective movie poster style with a cinematic and dramatic presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style evokes the aesthetics of vintage detective films through the use of sepia tones, stylized text, and background elements typical of film noir genres.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gray cap and gray shirt visually emphasized, either through contrast, lighting, or positioning, making them stand out in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates the gray cap and shirt within the overall design that features muted, retro colors. However, they are not particularly highlighted through contrast or lighting but blend into the overall sepia tone of the poster, not standing out as primary elements.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are shadowy textures (e.g., grain, dark shadows, or textured overlays) and angular lines visibly present in the image to reflect a noir style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a composition rich in shadowy textures and angular silhouettes, which are indicative of noir style. The dark contrasting elements, combined with the cityscape and the large magnifying glass, reflect typical noir aesthetics with such textural and line elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Gray Mystery\" displayed in a bold, classic serif typeface and clearly visible on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title present is 'The Gray Arste' instead of 'The Gray Mystery.' The text is designed in a serif typeface, suggesting a classic look. However, it does not specifically state or appear as 'The Gray Mystery,' which is crucial for this question.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B prominently features abstract silhouettes of buildings and a magnifying glass, elements associated with detective and mystery themes. These elements are part of the background and contribute to the detective motif captured in the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is characterized by a distinct sepia tone overlay that imparts a warm, vintage feel consistent with retro film aesthetics. This effect is visible throughout the entire image and integrates all elements into a cohesive vintage-themed presentation.",
