      "question": "Are the knitting needles visibly larger than their original size in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles appear more stylized and simplified compared to Image A. They are part of a cartoon-style illustration where objects are often exaggerated for effect. By contrast, in Image A, the knitting needles are more detailed and show a realistic size. Thus, due to the stylistic change, the needles in Image B appear larger.",

      "question": "Does the cup on the side table have visible swirling lines above it representing steam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman holding a cup with visible steaming lines above it, indicating a hot beverage. This is a classic representation of steam in illustrations to convey warmth or heat. Image A's cup, on the other hand, does not have any visible steam lines. This difference highlights that Image B uses visual cues typically used in cartoons to signify activity or state.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the fabric draped over the woman's lap been transformed to show a visible yarn or knitted pattern texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric appears to have a more pronounced knitted pattern and texture that is visually clear and part of the cartoon depiction, emphasizing individual stitches through exaggerated lines. In Image A, the fabric has a realistic, intricate design that reflects a genuine knitted texture but is less exaggerated. The cartoon styling in Image B accentuates these patterns more prominently.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a rectangular writing panel present in the image that has a border made to look like knitted yarn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a visible rectangular panel that simulates the look of an open book with a textured border resembling yarn or lace in a cartoon style. This stylistic addition isn't found in Image A, which maintains a realistic scene without any such visual embellishment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the writing panel located inside the pages of an open book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawn elements include what looks like an open book beneath the woman with a plain page ready for writing, consistent with cartoon tropes for displaying text or focus areas. This element is absent in Image A. Image B adds whimsical and symbolic elements not present in the first image.",

      "question": "Is there a soft, glowing lamplight visible in the image, contributing to a warm ambient glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a lamp that adds to a stylized warm glow essential for creating cozy and warm impressions typical of cartoon illustrations. Image A also has a lamp, but it is part of a naturalistic depiction where the light emanation effect is achieved through more realistic rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly exhibits features of cartoon art with its simplified textures, exaggerated features, and the inclusion of expressive design elements like steam lines, bold contours on the knitting, and simplified facial elements, indicating a transition to a more animated style from the realistic presentation of Image A.",
