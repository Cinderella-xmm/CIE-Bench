      "question": "Has the Hagia Sophia been transformed into a creature-like figure with a distinct body, head, or limb-like structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Hagia Sophia exhibits an otherworldly appearance due to the addition of wing-like structures and a large jewel-like object in front. The wings flank the central dome, contributing to a sense of transformation into a creature-like figure. These visual additions lend an animated and fantastical aura to the structure, making it resemble a creature more than a building. Despite these fantasy elements, there are no explicit features like legs or a head typical of creature anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the smaller domes on the sides of the structure appear as large, metallic, wing-like appendages extending outward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two large appendages, which are reminiscent of metallic, wing-like structures, extend outward on both sides of the central dome. These wings are detailed with celestial patterns and lights that make them appear metallic and otherworldly. The comparison with Image A shows that these wing-like appendages are a new addition to the structure as the original smaller domes in Image A maintain their architectural nature without such alterations.",

      "question": "Have the four minarets been replaced with long, slender, leg-like structures that support the body of the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four minarets retain their original form and architectural style, appearing unchanged from their depiction in Image A. They are still vertical and closely resemble the classical minaret structure. They do not exhibit characteristics resembling long, slender, leg-like appendages, nor do they visually support a creature-like body.",

      "question": "Are there glowing, intricate patterns resembling Byzantine art covering parts of the structureâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing and intricate patterns are present on the large, wing-like structures added to the building. The details, like lights and complex design, can be associated with artistic elegance characteristic of Byzantine art. However, these patterns are on the additional elements rather than the original surface of the structure itself, which remains architecturally consistent with its appearance in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the central dome been replaced with a large, jewel-like object that displays cosmic imagery such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central dome retains its original architectural form and characteristics as seen in Image A. It has not been replaced or altered to include cosmic imagery. Instead, a large jewel-like object is positioned at the front of the building displaying a bright blue hue, but doesn't replace the central dome itself.",
