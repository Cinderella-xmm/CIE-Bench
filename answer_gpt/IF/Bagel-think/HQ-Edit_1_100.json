      "question": "Is there a visible calendar layout element (such as a date, month, or decorative border) indicating the image is formatted as an art calendar page?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a decorative border around the image is indicative of a calendar layout. This decorative border is ornate and could contribute to the sense that the image is formatted as an art calendar page. Such border elements are commonly used in calendar designs to set off the page's imagery with a visually pleasing frame. This provides the suggestion of a calendar or illustrative art style, even without explicit date or month markers visible.",
