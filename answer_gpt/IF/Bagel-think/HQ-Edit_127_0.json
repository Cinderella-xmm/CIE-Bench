      "question": "Is the title \"The Nocturnal Observer's Guide\" clearly displayed on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the text at the bottom starts with 'The No.' followed by text that appears to mimic language but does not form coherent English words such as 'Noclisches Nares' and 'MittrarFiseh Pangnoaaiar'. These do not match 'The Nocturnal Observer's Guide'. Common sense reasoning indicates that the title is not as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tree and surrounding foliage display lush, highly detailed botanical features consistent with a scientific illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage and tree bark are illustrated with a stylized look rather than a botanically accurate detailing. They are represented in an artistic manner, matching stylistic illustrations rather than scientific illustration features.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image dominated by earthy tones, particularly highlighting the owl’s brown and cream plumage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's plumage consists of brown and cream tones, and these earthy colors extend to the tree bark. Although the background has greens and other colors, the predominant palette is earthy to complement the owl's plumage. Common knowledge of earthy tones supports this conclusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible labels pointing to and identifying the owl’s talons and feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes various text labels on the owl and the tree branch, such as 'Rëbbuborn', 'Bobyenettola', and 'Paslell '†Ethteagr'. They point to different parts, indicating an attempt to identify them. Common illustration practices for educational labeling suggest these are identifiers.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a dotted diagram with labeled lunar phases (e.g., waxing gibbous, full moon)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the moon as a solid white circle without additional markings or labels indicating lunar phases. Therefore, it is not depicted as a diagram showing different phases.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a text box located at the bottom of the image containing a short, descriptive paragraph about owl nocturnal adaptations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a text box at the bottom containing paragraphs with similarly obscured language or non-English words. These lack coherent descriptive language associated with owl nocturnal adaptations, thus the box doesn’t provide a clear informative paragraph on that subject.",
