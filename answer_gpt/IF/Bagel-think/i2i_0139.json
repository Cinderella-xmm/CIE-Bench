      "question": "Is the carrot now growing inside a space greenhouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrot is surrounded by a sleek, enclosed structure with metallic elements and visible panels, resembling a controlled environment like a space greenhouse. The design of the structure, featuring modern, metallic, and glass components, suggests an advanced greenhouse setting typically associated with space or futuristic environments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image include a metallic climate-controlled cultivation chamber surrounding the carrot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the carrot enclosed within a structure with metallic walls and clear panels, indicative of a controlled environment chamber. The appearance of the chamber, with its modern design and metallic framework, aligns with the characteristics of a climate-controlled cultivation chamber, which typically uses such materials for managing environmental conditions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carrot now rooted in synthetic substrate instead of natural soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the substrate surrounding the carrot appears more uniform and granular, resembling synthetic or engineered growing media used in controlled environments. Compared to Image A, where the substrate is irregular and earthy, Image Bâ€™s uniform and fine texture suggests a synthetic substrate designed for such specialized growth environments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the carrot appear visibly rooted in the synthetic substrate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carrot in Image B is firmly embedded in the granular substrate, visibly consistent with how plants are rooted in growing media. The well-defined placement of the carrot within this substrate suggests that it is appropriately rooted. The substrate's texture and placement offer visual confirmation of the rooting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has all evidence of the original outdoor garden environment been removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings of the carrot have been altered from an outdoor garden setting to a controlled indoor environment. The presence of metallic and transparent structures and the absence of backgrounds typical of a natural garden imply that the original outdoor elements have been replaced by an indoor space greenhouse environment.",
