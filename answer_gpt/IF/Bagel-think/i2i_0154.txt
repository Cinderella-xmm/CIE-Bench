    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image contain the front view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sports car's positioning shows a clear view of its front, characterized by visible headlights, the grille with the logo, and the front bumper. These features collectively indicate that the front of the car is prominently displayed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the edited image contain the side view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sports car is angled in such a way that both the front and a partial side view are visible. However, the image does not provide a clear side profile, but rather a combination of front and partial side view.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image contain the top view of the sports car?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perspective of the car does not include an overhead or bird's-eye view. The image primarily shows the front and a very limited side angle, without any indication of a top view.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the front, side, and top views visibly combined into a single image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, neither the side nor the top views are visible in conjunction with the front view. The image consists of the front view with a slight angle but lacks the comprehensive combination of different views (front, side, top) merged into one frame.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the combined image clear, appropriately scaled, and presented professionally for the specified uses?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the display of the sports car is clear and visually attractive; however, the phrase 'combined image' implies a collage or assembly of various perspective views (front, side, top) in a single frame. Since Image B does not showcase such a combination, this refers to presenting one or more perspectives together in a professionally formatted manner, which isn't applicable here.",
    "answer": "No"
