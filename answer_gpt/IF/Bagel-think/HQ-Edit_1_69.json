      "question": "Does the edited image contain multiple distinct postcard-style panels depicting the woman in different dynamic poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one depiction of the woman, not multiple postcard-style panels. The image appears as a singular comic-style panel within a box, making it clear that there are not multiple distinct panels showing various poses. The design elements in the image suggest a singular enclosed scene. Given this layout, it does not reflect multiple dynamic postcard-style panels.",

      "question": "Are the red dress and black leather jacket outlined with bold, thick lines and rendered in highly saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the woman with a red dress and black leather jacket depicted in a comic book style, which often uses bold outlines and saturated colors for clear visual impact. The saturation in the dress and jacket is high, and the outlines are thicker than in a realistic depiction, which is typical for comic-style illustrations to emphasize character features. Thus, these visual characteristics are consistent with the description given in the question.",

      "question": "Are there at least three different dynamic poses shown—such as walking, looking at neon signs, and browsing shop windows—in the postcard series?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B only features one dynamic pose of the woman walking. The edited image doesn't present multiple postcards or diverse dynamic poses like looking at neon signs or browsing shop windows. Therefore, based solely on Image B's contents, which display one primary activity within a single illustrated frame, there are not multiple poses shown.",

      "question": "Is the entire set of postcards presented within a black slipcase that has a silver foil embossed cityscape design on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portrayal features an encasing design that resembles a box. However, there is no indication of multiple postcards nor is there visible silver foil embossing on a cityscape on the slipcase surface. The depiction is largely singular and focused on one panel or cover image, not a set of postcards within a slipcase.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there comic-style visual elements such as panel borders, speech bubbles, or motion lines present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a comic-style illustration where the woman's attire and setting mimic a comic book page, shown through bold outlines and stylized colors. However, it lacks typical comic visual elements such as speech bubbles or motion lines that accent comic narratives. The panel border is suggested by the outer frame of the box, but standard comic elements like speech bubbles are absent.",
