      "question": "Is the officer wearing a brown leather trench coat instead of the original naval uniform?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the officer is wearing a brown leather trench coat with details such as gears and mechanical components suggestive of steampunk aesthetics, which contrasts with the traditional naval uniform seen in Image A. The appearance of the jacket, combined with the knowledge of steampunk and historical clothing styles, confirms the change from a naval uniform to a steampunk trench coat.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, displays brass gears and mechanical components prominently on the officer's clothing, reflecting a steampunk influence. These additions are a notable deviation from Image A, where the clothing lacked such elements.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the officer is still holding a bell in his right hand, consistent with Image A. There is no indication of a change to a chronometer-like gadget. The object retains its bell shape and detail in both images.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a fantastical sky featuring airships and floating city elements. This is a notable change from Image A, which has a serene ocean background with the sky at sunset. The distinct designs of the airships indicate a steampunk influence, confirming the transformation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tricorne hat worn by the officer has goggles attached to it. This detail is absent in Image A, where the hat is a traditional naval design. Goggles are consistent with the steampunk aesthetic seen in Image B.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The officer's posture, holding an object in his right hand while standing with a confident demeanor, remains consistent between Image A and Image B. Given that the facial expression is not blur, the posture aspect entirely guides this answer.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
