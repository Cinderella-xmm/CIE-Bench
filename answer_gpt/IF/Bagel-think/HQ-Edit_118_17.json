      "question": "Is the stave church enclosed within a transparent glass display case with visible structural framing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stave church is inside a transparent case with visible edges and framing that are characteristic of a glass display case. This suggests that the structure is designed to hold the church model securely and display it similarly to a showcase or miniature preserve. This conclusion is based on the appearance of clear panels and the visible framework that outlines its boundaries.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there multiple layers of soft, wispy clouds visible in the background panel behind the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background behind the stave church inside the display case depicts layers of clouds that appear soft and wispy. This is inferred from their fluffy texture and placement, which gives them a layered look, akin to what is typically used in diorama settings to mimic natural skies.",

      "question": "Are small-scale coniferous trees positioned around the base of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple small-scale coniferous trees around the base within the display case. These trees are identifiable by their conical shape and needle-like foliage, typical of pine or spruce trees and contribute to the miniaturized diorama effect within the case.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains visible in the background behind the display case have a muted and desaturated color palette. This is characterized by the use of pale grays and blues that give a low-contrast look, commonly used in miniature displays to create an atmospheric depth without overpowering the main subject.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a sculpted rocky terrain is visible at the base of the display case, serving as a foundation for the stave church model. The terrain features small, carved rock formations that add topographical details to the display, suggesting a natural landscape bottom.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of a snowy path or footprint imprints leading to the entrance of the stave church within the display case. The base area around the church model appears mostly smooth without textural details such as snow or footprints.",
