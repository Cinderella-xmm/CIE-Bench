    "Question": "Q1: Has the diffuse, smoky brown background been replaced with an expansive blackboard?",
    "explanation": "In edited Image B, the background is black and features a blackboard format filled with white chalk-like writing. This is visibly different from Image A, where the background is a diffuse, smoky brown. The presence of a blackboard in Image B suggests a notable background change.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the blackboard intricately covered with chalk-written equations of relativity and swirling galactic sketches?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a blackboard covered with various white chalk-like writings and symbols. The pattern resembles complex equations and swirling sketches, consistent with elements one might associate with relativity and galactic imagery. This analysis relies on the visual details such as circles and curves while not meant for exact identification.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the soft, warm illumination on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple remain consistent after the background change?",
    "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the soft, warm illumination of the scene is consistent. The light source and quality appear similar, maintaining the warm glow and shadows on both Albert Einstein and the pineapple, irrespective of the different background in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the blackboard exhibit an aged appearance?",
    "explanation": "Blackboards generally have an aged appearance due to chalk residue, scratches, and a dull surface texture. In Image B, the blackboard displays these characteristics with visible marks and patterns indicating use, which suggests an aged appearance typical for frequently used blackboards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the positions and appearances of Albert Einstein and the pineapple remained unchanged?",
    "explanation": "The positions and proportions of Albert Einstein and the pineapple in Image B are identical to those in Image A. There are no notable alterations in terms of positioning or appearance, aside from the changed background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
