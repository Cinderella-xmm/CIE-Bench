    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the police car fully constructed from LEGO bricks, with no realistic or photographic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the police car is entirely constructed from LEGO bricks. The block-like structure, uniformity of brick texture, and iconic LEGO design indicate that the entire car is built with LEGO bricks. There are no elements that suggest realistic or photographic features; everything is consistent with constructed LEGO models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the body panels of the car primarily composed of blue and black LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body panels of the car in Image B are composed of distinctly recognizable blue and black LEGO bricks. This observation is made by identifying the consistent use of LEGO bricks' shape and the alternating color scheme typical of LEGO creations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the emergency lights on top and the front headlights made from red and blue translucent LEGO pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emergency lights on top of the LEGO car in Image B are made from red and blue translucent LEGO pieces, which are common elements used to simulate real lights on LEGO models. This is evident from the visual cues of the semi-transparent red and blue parts, which are characteristic of LEGO's design for light features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the windows of the car constructed from beige LEGO bricks instead of transparent or clear pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows of the car in Image B are not constructed from beige LEGO bricks. Instead, they are made from transparent or clear LEGO pieces, which are typically used to simulate glass in LEGO models, allowing visibility through them. Beige bricks would not offer this transparency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grille and wheels constructed from small LEGO blocks showing detailed brickwork and modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grille and wheels of the LEGO car in Image B clearly show detailed brickwork typical of LEGO construction. The grille particularly features small LEGO blocks arranged in a modular form, while the wheels also exhibit a distinct LEGO structure, showcasing the typical blockiness and connectivity of LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the LEGO car positioned on a plain matte gray surface with no additional textures, patterns, or background details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO car is positioned on a plain matte gray surface in Image B with no additional textures, patterns, or background details. This is apparent from the solid color and flat texture observed beneath the LEGO car, consistent with the setup typically used for photographing LEGO models to emphasize the model itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
