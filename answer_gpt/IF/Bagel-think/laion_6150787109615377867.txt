    "Question": "Q1: Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop is not replaced with a gear-shaped component, but it does have intricate engravings on the surface. The round tabletop features intricate patterns, but it lacks the gear-shaped teeth indicative of a gear. This intricate design is more decorative than functional in terms of gear mechanics. Image A shows a simple metallic pattern with no such intricate engravings or gear-like elements on the tabletop.",

    "Question": "Q5: Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
    "explanation": "The edited image B presents a table that integrates various mechanical components such as gears, valves, and ornate engravings, typical of steampunk aesthetics. These components do not transform the table into a creature but enhance the table with a mechanized, fantastical appearance. Image A lacks any such thematic elements, showcasing a basic metallic design. Thus, the transformation aligns more with steampunk style machinery rather than a creature.",
