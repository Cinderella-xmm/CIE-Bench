    "Question": "Q1: Is the map rendered as a partially unfurled scroll floating above a stylized ocean?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the map appears to be partially extended above what seems to be a turquoise-blue, stylized ocean with undulating curves, suggesting movement or water.

This rendering contrasts with the traditional flat representation in historical maps, combining the scroll with ocean imagery which is a creative alteration that is not present in traditional maps.",
