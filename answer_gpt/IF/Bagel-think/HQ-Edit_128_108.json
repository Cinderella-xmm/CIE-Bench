      "question": "Is the ornate lantern now presented as a candle brand packaging rather than a hanging light fixture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on a packaging box, prominently featuring the branding elements of a candle product. The ornate lantern from Image A, which functioned as a hanging light fixture, is not directly visible but instead, the concept has been translated into the design and branding of a box. This implies a transformation from a lantern to a candle brand packaging.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a color scheme that prominently features deep golds and ambers, giving the packaging a rich and warm appearance. This is a departure from the diverse and colorful scene in Image A, focusing instead on a uniform luxurious color palette for the packaging.",
