      "question": "Does the image have bright, clean lines and textures characteristic of Pixar animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phone and charger exhibit bright, clean, and exaggerated textures that are typical of animation and are reminiscent of Pixar’s style. The pink color of the phone and orange for the charger add vibrancy, and the rendering is smooth, resembling animated environments rather than realistic ones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the phone still positioned diagonally on the charger, and do the cables maintain their original placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the phone maintains its diagonal position relative to the charger. The cable is similarly positioned at the base of the phone, and its orientation extends outward in a curve. By comparing this with Image A, the orientation of these elements is consistent; both wires extend in similar manners across the green surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image vibrant and saturated, consistent with Pixar's animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows vibrant and highly saturated colors, such as the bright pink of the phone, orange of the charger, and the vivid green background. These color choices and their saturation are consistent with the Pixar animation style, which often uses bold, eye-catching palettes to convey a lively and engaging atmosphere.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting create smooth shadows that enhance the three-dimensional look of the phone and charger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting does create smooth shadows, enhancing the dimensionality of both the phone and the charger. The shadows are subtle but distinct, contributing to a definition that emphasizes depth perception, akin to techniques used in animation to provide a sense of roundness and solidity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any objects or elements been added or removed from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A reveals that there are no additional elements introduced nor has anything been removed — only the styles are altered. The phone is more animated-looking, the charger follows suit, and the cable colors are different, yet structurally and elementally, they remain intact.",
