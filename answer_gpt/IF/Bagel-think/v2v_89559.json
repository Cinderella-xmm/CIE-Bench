      "question": "Have the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos been transformed into stylized, gleaming golden award statuettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logos are in a shiny golden style which resembles award statuettes. The 'Search for a Star' logo is visibly rendered in a gold finish. In comparison with Image A, where the logo is in a more cartoonish, non-metallic style, Image B distinctly transforms these logos into a gleaming, golden appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been changed to a rich, dark velvet curtain, replacing the original green background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dark, velvet-like curtain as the background, which contrasts against the original Image A where the background is a flat, bright green. This distinction in background texture and color showcases the change from a solid to a textured, curtain-like aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 'Sumo Digital' logo rendered as an embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque beneath the 'Rising Star' logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Sumo Digital' logo appears as part of a wooden plaque that includes an embossed star, consistent with being an embossed seal. In Image A, it does not have this plaque or embossed appearance, making Image B distinct in this transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text presented in elegant, engraved silver lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text appears in a style that mimics engraved or embossed silver letters, providing a shiny and metallic appearance. Contrastingly, Image A presents the text in a simpler, bold white font. This gives Image B a more elegant and luxurious style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the structural integrity of the original image been maintained while applying the specified changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structural elements such as the position of logos and text remain consistent between Image A and Image B, with the primary differences being stylistic rather than structural. Thus, despite the aesthetic changes, the overall layout and structure are intact supporting the content while enhancing the presentation.",
