      "question": "Has the dog been converted into a chibi-style blind box figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object visible is of a smaller, more stylized form, often associated with chibi-style figures, which are characterized by their 'cute' and exaggerated features. Given this information, combined with knowledge that chibi figures typically have a cartoonish and simplified design, it is reasonable to conclude that the dog has indeed been transformed into a chibi-style figure in this version.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dog’s body still in the prone, ball-focused pose after the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible portion of the object lacks detailed features that resemble a dog in a prone pose, focused on a ball. Instead, it shows more of a stylized and simplified figure commonly seen in blind box figures. Comparing with Image A, where the dog is clearly shown in a prone position, it is clear that the pose is not retained post-edit.",

      "question": "Has the dog's head been enlarged slightly compared to its original size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Typically, chibi-style figures feature exaggerated proportions, such as enlarged heads. In Image B, the figure's head is prominently larger and stands out as a primary feature, contrasting with Image A, where the dog’s head is in natural proportion to the body. This indicates an enlargement of the head in the edited version.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball placed so that it touches the dog's nose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no tennis ball shown touching the nose of the figure. In contrast, Image A depicts the dog with a ball quite close to its nose. While Image A has the ball in close proximity to the dog, the edit lacks this detail entirely, indicating no direct interaction with a tennis ball.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base feature a relief tennis ball pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base has a visible design which hints at a textured pattern common in decorative bases for standing figures. However, without clear detail signifying a tennis ball pattern specifically, it is reasonable to conclude, based on the lack of specificity in the pattern matching a known tennis ball motif, that it does not feature a tennis ball pattern.",
