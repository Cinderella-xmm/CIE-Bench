      "question": "Have the clothing patterns been replaced with southwestern fabrics such as denim or woven textile designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements such as denim or woven textile patterns are not directly associated with clothing; instead, the theme is western-oriented, focusing on other design elements like boots and hats. Comparing it to Image A, which has specific attire patterns related to the individuals shown, the second image doesn't emphasize clothing details but rather a theme encapsulated in textual and decorative elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of cacti silhouettes and an artistic representation of the setting sun is clearly evident as they form integral parts of the design elements. The background of Image A is primarily wood, featuring branding and other background signage without such illustrative elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text style 'BLOTEDA CORADA' appears in a handmade, distressed font style characterized by an uneven, aged look, which contrasts with Image A where the 'FGL HOUSE' is presented in a more straightforward, solid typography without a distressed effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) incorporates several western-themed elements like cowboy boots, hats, and stars, providing a thematic layer aligning with a western narrative. Image A lacks these accessory elements, as it primarily focuses on individuals against the wooden background without such thematic decorations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents itself as a collage where diverse components such as boots, hats, cacti, and stylistic fonts create a layered effect. This differs from Image A, which maintains a traditional photograph with straightforward subject matter and minimal stylized narrative elements.",

      "explanation": "The visual arrangement in Image B, through the consistent use of western motifs, such as boots and hats, alongside vintage fonts and decorative imagery, cohesively delivers a western-themed design that is stylistically inviting, unlike Image A which sticks to a modern and straightforward aesthetic.",
