    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image showing a single, continuous serpent-shaped creature composed of the beads instead of loose or clustered beads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads are arranged in a way that resembles a continuous, serpent-like form. Unlike loose or randomly clustered beads, the editing creates a singular impression of a snake's body. It curves and winds in a manner that is characteristic of a serpent. This organized arrangement of beads into a coherent shape suggests intentional design to mimic a creature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and yellow patterns used to create a scaly texture along the body of the serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows beads with red and yellow colors that resemble scales. These colors are distributed across the serpent-shaped form in a way that mimics the natural pattern seen on reptilian scales. The alternating colors and positions give the impression of a textured surface similar to that of a reptile's skin.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the serpent have two blue circular features positioned as eyes at its head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are two prominent blue circular features on one end of the bead arrangement which can be interpreted as eyes. These features are symmetrically positioned, reinforcing the interpretation of this end of the arrangement as the head of the serpent-like creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black motifs arranged as detailed, tribal-style patterns along the serpent’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays black motifs distributed along the beads, which suggest the type of intricate, geometric designs often associated with tribal patterns. These motifs provide detail to the serpent-like body, enhancing the overall appearance with complex and decorative elements characteristic of tribal art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s tail extend into a long, thin, flowing form with small, dangling bead-like tips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the tail end of the serpent, the edited image shows a rope-like structure extending into a few thin strands, each ending with small beads. This creates the visual effect of a tail splitting into several flowing parts, with dangling bead-like tips that enhance the depiction of a creature's tail.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image predominantly features the original colors of red, yellow, blue, and black. There is no noticeable introduction of any additional colors that do not belong to the initial palette provided by the beads, maintaining consistency with the original color scheme.",
