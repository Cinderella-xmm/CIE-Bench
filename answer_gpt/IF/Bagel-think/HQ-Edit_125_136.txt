    "Question": "Q1: Is the title “Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics” present in the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title is 'CUUPARING MACRĒ CRIAS', which does not resemble or transform into the phrase 'Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics'. Therefore, the title mentioned in the question is not present in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the astronaut, Moon, and ISS depicted using simplified, vector-style shapes rather than photorealistic rendering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style of the astronaut, Moon, and ISS showcases simplified and flat shapes, typical of vector graphics. This contrasts with the photorealistic style in image A, where textures and lighting create realism. The depiction in Image B supports the idea of a vector style representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the spacesuit include visible textural details such as stitching or fabric patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the spacesuit without detailed textures such as stitching or fabric patterns, which are usually found in photorealistic images. The depiction is more illustrative and clean, fitting a vector-style design that lacks these small detailed textures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are gold accents used in the image to emphasize certain elements such as labels, borders, or arrows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, gold accents are visible on certain spots, like the labels and certain borders on the spacesuit, enhancing particular elements with this color contrast. This use of gold emphasizes specific parts of the design visually.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there three sequential stages illustrated with arrows showing the astronaut's movement toward or interaction with the space station?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows arrows pointing from labeled circles with simplified icons: a foot, a profile bust, and a numeral '3', along with directional arrows. However, these do not depict three sequential stages of movement or interaction distinctly as part of a narrative toward the space station.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the labels “Step 1: Prepare”, “Step 2: Navigate”, and “Step 3: Operate” displayed in sequence along the bottom of the image?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display these labels anywhere within the image. The image has different labels, but none of them are related to 'Prepare', 'Navigate', or 'Operate' as described in the question.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the entire infographic arranged in a vertical format with elements stacked from top to bottom?",
    "explanation": "Image B arranges elements horizontally more than vertically, with the astronaut centrally positioned and the labels and icons extending sideways rather than contributing to a stacked vertical layout.",
    "answer": "No"
