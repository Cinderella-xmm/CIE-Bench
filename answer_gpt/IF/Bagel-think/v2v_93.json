      "question": "Is the thermometer depicted in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer has a visual style that suggests a 3D element; its dial and casing appear slightly exaggerated with a comic-like presentation. The smooth gradients and bold colors associated with cartoon art are present. These features contribute to its depiction in a cartoon style, likely intended to give it a playful or vivid design often seen in animated or 3D rendered objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image use soft lighting to highlight the thermometer's metallic finish and clearly visible dial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears more direct with hard shadows, focusing on enhancing the 3D cartoon style rather than highlighting the metallic finish, which contrasts with typical soft lighting. The design seems less about realistic texture details and more about stylized representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] clearly incorporated into the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no explicit text elements conveying the stats of [Temperature Range +200] or [Accuracy +10°C]. The text areas don't contain such information, focusing instead on numeric values of the thermometer dial itself.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a title banner at the top labeled \"Precision Thermal Gauge\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not showcase a title banner labeled 'Precision Thermal Gauge'. The top of the image contains only the dial of the thermometer and no additional descriptive or titling information is present.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Is there a nameplate at the bottom identifying the item's designation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a nameplate at the bottom displaying the word 'TEMPERATURE'. While the nameplate does have text, it does not specifically identify the item's designation beyond the general label 'TEMPERATURE'.",

      "question": "Does the image have crisp borders surrounding the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is framed by a distinct border that surrounds the card. The border is sharp, paralleling the edges, which typically suggests a defined encapsulated design, common in card-like presentations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background in cool, professional tones that subtly convey scientific precision?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B uses tones of blue within the card area, which are cooler and generally convey a formal or professional atmosphere. The chosen shades tend to align with the notion of scientific or precision-oriented presentation where blue implies stability and trust.",
