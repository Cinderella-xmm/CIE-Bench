    "Question": "Q1: Are the chicken wings replaced with plush toy replicas made of golden-brown fabric that have a slightly crunchy texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows objects resembling chicken wings but are clearly fashioned from fabric, with stitched edges and a golden-brown color. Common knowledge indicates these are toy replicas, as real food would not have such textile characteristics. This indicates they are fabric-based plush toys, resembling chicken wings but not edible.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the sauce replaced with a soft, textured pillow in bright orange?",
    "explanation": "The sauce in Image B is represented as a round object sitting in a small dish that visually appears soft and plush-like, in a bright orange tone.

    "Question": "Q4: Are the plush wings and the orange pillow arranged in the same spatial configuration as the original chicken wings and sauce?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image A, the chicken wings and sauce are arranged on a plate with a specific layout. Image B replicates this spatial arrangement using plush toys and a pillow. The toys maintain the same positions relative to each other and to the sauce dish as the wings and sauce in Image A, indicating an identical configuration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the plush wings and pillow clearly appear as fabric-based toys rather than real food items?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows objects shaped like food but with clear textile characteristics such as stitching and fabric texture. This implies they are toy replicas made from textiles rather than actual food items. Visual cues such as plush texture, stitching, and consistent coloration typical of fabric toys, as opposed to food, support this conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
