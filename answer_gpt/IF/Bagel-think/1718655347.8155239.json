      "question": "Is the crimson moon replaced by a circular motif made of golden threads, resembling an embroidered pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon does not appear as a realistic celestial object but instead as a circular pattern with a golden thread-like texture surrounding it, which resembles an embroidered design. This is unlike a natural moon appearance, which typically has a smooth texture and monochromatic tones. The edited version emphasizes texture and design similar to embroidery patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-capped mountain peaks transformed into interlocking geometric shapes rather than natural mountain forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks do not maintain the organic shape normally associated with natural mountain ranges. Instead, they are depicted as geometric shapes interwoven together, which suggests an abstract or stylized representation rather than a realistic depiction of an alpine landscape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red trees replaced with stylized embroidery patterns that mimic stitched textile designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows red trees represented in a form that resembles embroidered patterns, where thread-like lines are used instead of realistic foliage. This suggests the editor aimed to mimic textile designs, which can be recognized by the consistent use of thread motifs throughout these elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface of the lake rendered as silvery-blue silk strands, giving it a textile-like appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the lake does not exhibit the natural reflections and fluid characteristics usually seen in water. Instead, it maintains a texture that appears similar to silk strands, which aligns with textile patterns giving it an embroidered or fabric-like appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a consistent tapestry-like quality with visible threadwork, stitched textures, and a fabric-based aesthetic across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirety of Image B utilizes a design that mimics tapestry and embroidery. The use of geometric shapes, thread-like patterns, and a texture consistent with fabric art confirms a coherent theme of apparent threadwork and stitched design throughout the scene, affirming a fabric-based aesthetic across all elements.",
