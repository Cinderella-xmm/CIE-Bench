      "question": "Has the desk and background been replaced with a forest floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a forest setting with blurred trees and a forest floor made of soil and scattered leaves. This contrasts with the solid color or marble-design surface typically associated with a desk, as seen in Image A. This suggests that the desk and background have indeed been replaced with a forest floor in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the broccoli appear camouflaged as a small real tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli's appearance resembles that of a small tree, with the broccoli head mimicking a tree canopy due to its texture and branching structure, and the stem resembling a trunk. The surrounding environment in Image B, which includes a forest floor and additional plant elements, helps the broccoli blend into the scene as if it were a small tree.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there sunlight filtering through the canopy in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a bright light source from above, suggesting sunlight filtering through the tree canopy. This is indicated by the presence of light rays and a halo effect coming through the upper part of the image, consistent with sunlight penetrating a forest tree canopy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the broccoli positioned naturally within the forest floor, as if it were growing there?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli is integrated into the forest floor context, with its base appearing to be seamlessly connected to the soil and surrounding debris. This placement gives the impression that the broccoli is growing from the ground, consistent with how a tree might naturally grow in a forest setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene convey a natural and believable camouflage effect of the broccoli as a tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B successfully transforms the broccoli into an element of a forest scene with convincing visual details. The broccoli's texture and shape closely mimic a tree, and its integration with the forest background enhances this illusion. The scene is crafted to appear natural, helping convey the camouflaged effect convincingly.",
