      "question": "Is the image vertically oriented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the height is greater than the width, which is a primary characteristic of a vertical orientation. The pear and platform are centrally placed, further affirming this orientation. Based on visual cues, the orientation aligns with a vertical layout.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary visual elements include a pear within a glass box on a platform.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object within the glass box in Image B is a pear with a bitten section. This bitten area maintains the realistic texture and appearance of a pear, which complements the pear's natural characteristics. The overall design and finish appear polished and seamless like a real fruit.",

      "question": "Are both figures enclosed within a transparent glass cube that reflects the natural wood grain look and color of the backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a singular pear positioned inside a transparent glass cube. No additional figure is observed within the enclosure. While the background matches a wood grain, the glass cube only contains the pear. Thus, only one figure is inside the cube.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B uses warm tones that blend with the natural wooden backdrop, similar to the original. The backdrop transitions from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone, delivering a cohesive and inviting visual presentation. Such lighting enhances the image's overall aesthetic quality.",
