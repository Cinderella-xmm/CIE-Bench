      "question": "Is the tiger figure rendered in a flat, cut-paper style with defined edges and no realistic shading?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a tiger figure with bold outlines and solid colors, indicative of the cut-paper style, which lacks the realistic shading and depth found in images attempting to depict realism.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's stripes are depicted with broad strokes and have a more pronounced, stylized look compared to the more intricate and narrower patterns seen on real tigers.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whiskers do not appear prominently elongated or thickened. The image adopts a stylized approach, but the whiskers maintain a size in line with typical depictions of tigers. They do not stand out as especially exaggerated in size.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B presents with a layered effect, characterized by distinct color blocks and defined edges indicative of paper layering. This visual cue suggests a planned assembly of paper layers, resembling the technique used in paper crafts.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the structured paper art style is present, there are no visible perforations, tabs, or explicit fold lines that suggest detachable sections. The presented elements appear to be part of a cohesive design rather than indicating interaction features like folding or detachment.",
