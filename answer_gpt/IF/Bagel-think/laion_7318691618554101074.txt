    "Question": "Q1: Are all makeup brushes replaced with sculpted crystal wands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects in the container are clearly different from typical makeup brushes. They resemble elongated, decorative structures and have ornate tips suggesting they are sculpted crystal wands. The presence of reflective surfaces and faceted tips is indicative of crystal wands, contrasting with makeup brushes which typically have soft bristles. Therefore, these are not makeup brushes, but sculpted crystal wands.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the container is clearly transparent and exhibits floral patterns that appear etched. The design is delicate and precise, often characteristic of crystal vases.

    "Question": "Q4: Has the lace band been replaced with a carved crystal ribbon?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows no lace band around the container. The visible patterns are part of the crystal vase itself rather than an external adornment, like a lace band. Given the detailed patterns embedded in the vase, a 'carved crystal ribbon' would imply a removable object like the lace band in Image A. Since Image B shows these patterns as part of the vase, it's not a replacement of the lace band.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire arrangement placed on a mirrored surface that reflects the crystal vase and wands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface underneath the vase does indeed look like a mirrored surface since there are reflections of the patterns from the bottom of the table. This suggests the arrangement sits on such a surface, commonly known for creating reflections of objects placed on it, thereby reflecting the crystal vase and wands.",
    "answer": "Yes"
