      "question": "Has the wooden surface been replaced with an elegant marble texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the teapot is a smooth, light-colored texture that resembles a marble surface, which is commonly associated with elegance and is often used in premium settings. In contrast, Image A features a wooden surface with visible grain and texture, suggesting that Image B indeed replaces the wooden surface with a marble texture. The identification of marble comes from its characteristic veining and polished finish.",

      "question": "Is there a transparent label overlaid on the teapot with visible text including \"Earl Grey Elegance\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent round label on the teapot, which includes text featuring phrases such as 'GH AD' and other decorative elements, but there is no text stating 'Earl Grey Elegance'. The text is embedded within the design of the label rather than being transparently overlaid. In Image A, there is no similar label present.",

      "question": "Is there a finely embossed gold monogram logo visible on the lid of the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a teapot lid featuring intricate engravings, and a monogram-like element is visible on the label presented in front of the teapot, but there is no gold monogram specifically embossed on the lid itself. Image A shows detailed engravings on the lid without any monogram logo.",

      "question": "Is there a box present in the image with engravings similar in style to those on the teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a packaging box that incorporates design elements similar to those on the teapot, such as ornate engravings and a consistent color scheme, reflecting a unified design style. This parallels the style of the teapot seen in Image A, which itself features intricate engravings indicative of a cohesive branding style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition reflect a luxury tea brand packaging design with cohesive branding elements such as elegant textures, consistent engravings, and premium presentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a luxury tea brand packaging design through various elements: the elegant marble-like texture on the surface, the consistent use of intricate engravings on both the teapot and the packaging box, and the high-quality presentation of the product, all contributing to a premium, cohesive branding. Image A features a traditional teapot setting but lacks the additional packaging elements seen in Image B, which amplifies the theme of luxury and branding.",
