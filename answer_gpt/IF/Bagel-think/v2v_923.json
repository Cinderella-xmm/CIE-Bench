      "question": "Does the illustration include a full-body depiction of the creature that incorporates elements like scissors, rulers, or pens?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted as a unique character that seems to be constructed from elements of a pattern piece, such as the 'Dart' label. However, there are no direct incorporations of the scissors, ruler, or pen visually forming parts of the creature's body. Instead, it appears to be a hybrid creature with wings and feet, and the design visually mimics the pattern piece without directly integrating the tools seen in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, near the creature's feet, there is a small orb resembling a globe with a grid pattern.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B includes the name 'Darter' displayed beneath the character. This is a creative play on the word 'dart,' which is part of the pattern piece in Image A and aligns with the themed design of the creature.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no explicit mention or labeling of an elemental type such as 'Craft,' 'Metal,' 'Precision,' or 'Pattern' in Image B. The focus is on the creature's design elements and the creative name, but there's no text indicating an elemental type.",
