      "question": "Has the entire cruise ship been replaced with translucent, iridescent crystal structures that resemble a palace?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cruise ship displays a distinct transformation; its structure is now comprised of translucent, iridescent panels that resemble the facets of a crystal. These contribute to a palace-like appearance. Combining world knowledge, this alteration is significant from the typical solid, metal ship designs, giving off a fantastical aesthetic akin to crystal palaces or ice castles often depicted in fictional settings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the hull been replaced with clear, angular, and faceted crystal structures rather than a smooth, solid form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the hull of the ship is characterized by a complex arrangement of clear, angular, and faceted crystal-like structures. This is in stark contrast to a conventional smooth and solid hull, indicating a transformation to a more faceted crystalline appearance typically associated with gems or cut glass.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have all windows been transformed into multifaceted gem-like elements with visible facets and reflective properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the overall structure of the ship appears crystalline, the individual windows are no longer distinct. Instead of clear panes of glass, they now blend into the multifaceted, gem-like surface of the ship, suggesting they too have been incorporated into this crystalline transformation, which includes visible facets and a reflective nature inherent to crystal structures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the decks been replaced with intricate, transparent crystal pathways featuring detailed patterns or latticework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decks in Image B, rather than having traditional solid surfaces typical of ships, seem to integrate into the overall crystal design, forming intricate pathways. The transparent qualities and pattern-like appearance are consistent with latticework found in decorative crystal structures, contributing to the ship's ethereal quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been simplified to a minimalist horizon with no visible islands or complex terrain, emphasizing the crystal ship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the background, including the sea and sky, still retains complexity with visible mountains and clouds, as in a natural landscape. Hence, it has not been simplified to a minimalist horizon. Instead, the focus remains on the transformed ship against a familiar natural backdrop.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there strong visual contrast between the shimmering, iridescent crystal ship and the minimalist background, enhancing the perception of brilliance and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is indeed a stark contrast between the ship and its surroundings. The ship's shimmering, iridescent appearance contrasts sharply with the natural tones of the sky and water, enhancing the perception of the ship's brilliance and transparency. While the background is not minimalist, the distinct nature of the ship ensures its standout presence.",
