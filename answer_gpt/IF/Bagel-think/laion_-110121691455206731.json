      "question": "Is the edited image a comic strip consisting of at least two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is divided into four distinct sections, each containing different visual content and speech bubbles, which are characteristics typical of a comic strip format. Therefore, it meets the criteria for having at least two distinct panels.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does Panel 1 show the watch with a face drawn on its dial, seated at a detective desk, and polishing its metal exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 1 shows a hand holding a watch, and there is no depiction of it seated at a desk or involved in an activity like polishing its metal exterior. The focus is on the watch and its interaction with the context provided in the speech bubble.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 1 features a dialogue that is not in a recognizable real language but appears to be a playful jumble of characters resembling words in a speech bubble. The specific phrase 'Time to solve this case, down to the last second! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è' is not present.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does Panel 2 show Chrono in a cluttered office with scattered clues, examining a magnifying glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 2 does not depict a scene with an office environment or any clutter or magnifying glass. It instead focuses on a watch shown close-up, with speech bubbles but without any additional contextual environment such as an office setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible onomatopoeic sound effects like 'tick' or 'tock' around the watch dial in any of the panels. The panels focus more on visual representation and text in speech bubbles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, though stylized as a black-and-white comic, mimics the reflective quality of the original watch's silver components through the use of various shades of grey and white to represent shine and metal texture, thereby reflecting its original appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the watch is stylized within a comic strip, there is no cartoonish facial expression depicted on the watch dial itself. The watch retains its realistic design without anthropomorphic features.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B features text in speech bubbles that resembles jumbled or mirrored phonetic representations but does not contain the specific phrase 'No detail too small for Detective Chrono! üíº', indicating a different context.",
