      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures appear to have a smooth and shiny surface, indicative of a high-gloss finish that is characteristic of fine porcelain.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nativity scene is set within an architectural structure with columns and what appears to be a smooth, polished texture, resembling marble.
