      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the table and its design are consistent with outdoor café furniture — it has a round-shaped table top, often found in café settings. In contrast, Image A depicts a wooden surface indoors which further confirms the table in Image B is a different one suited for an outdoor environment. This combined understanding of typical furniture design confirms the presence of a café table in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is there a snowy cabin visible in the background of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a structure resembling a cabin with a snow-covered roof and extra snow seen around it and in the surrounding environment. This understanding is based on recognizing structural elements typical of cabins and snow accumulation patterns in winter settings. In contrast, Image A shows a more indoor setting without any snowy or cabin features. Thus, the presence of a snowy cabin in Image B is confirmed.",

      "question": "Does the image display elements contributing to a warm winter atmosphere, such as warm lighting or steam from the drinks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam emanates from the drinks, indicating warmth in a cold environment. Additionally, the warm lighting around the cabin structure enhances the perception of warmth against the snowy background, which is characteristic of cozy winter atmospheres. These elements together convey a deliberate warm ambiance. Image A similarly features steaming drinks but lacks the winter context and warm lighting contrast. Therefore, Image B effectively portrays a warm winter atmosphere.",

      "question": "Is the outdoor café table correctly positioned in front of the snowy cabin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the perspective offered in Image B, the outdoor café table is logically placed in front of the cabin, maintaining spatial coherence within the image. This setup is typical for café settings where tables are situated outside such establishments. Therefore, the positioning in Image B aligns with common outdoor café arrangements.",

      "question": "Are there any elements from the original background still present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the background has been distinctly altered with the snowy cabin and winter scene, contrasting the original indoor setting without shared elements. Image A's background shows an indoor environment which has been completely replaced in Image B, confirming the absence of original background elements in the edited image.",
