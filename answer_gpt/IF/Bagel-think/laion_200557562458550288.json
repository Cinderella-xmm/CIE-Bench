      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the image been transformed from a flat jersey display into a full promotional poster layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a background and additional graphic elements, such as stylized motion lines, which are typical components of a promotional poster layout. In contrast, Image A is a simple presentation of the jersey with a plain background. The presence of these additional design elements in Image B suggests that the image has been converted into a promotional format.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the jersey as an anthropomorphic cyclist character with a body shape and posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit any characteristics that suggest a body shape or human-like posture. The jersey retains its original form without modifications to arms, legs, or a human-like pose. This indicates that Image B does not depict the jersey as an anthropomorphic character.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are facial features (such as eyes, nose, or mouth) present on the chest area where the star was originally located?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a cartoon-like face on the chest area featuring eyes and a mouth, partially replacing the original star emblem of Image A. The presence of these facial features is evident in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image limited to blue, white, red, and gray, matching the original jersey's color scheme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images feature the colors white, blue, red, and gray prominently. Image B maintains these colors consistently across the jersey and the background, staying true to the original color scheme found in Image A.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stylized motion lines or speed effects visible around the anthropomorphic cyclist character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are stylized graphic elements around the jersey that resemble motion lines or speed effects, suggesting movement or a dynamic environment. These elements are part of the promotional design strategy, unlike Image A, which lacks any such dynamic effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text \"Ride Like a Star!\" displayed in bold, diagonal font in the bottom left corner of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text at the bottom left does not say 'Ride Like a Star!' Instead, it is visually unclear and appears altered. Thus, Image B does not include this specific text format.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the overall layout combine structured composition (e.g., balanced elements) with energetic visual cues (e.g., motion lines, strong angles)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features both structured elements from the jersey design and additional energetic visual cues like motion lines, creating a dynamic and engaging composition. The layout uses the jersey's structured design elements and combines them with external graphic effects to convey dynamism, unlike the purely structured presentation in Image A.",
