      "question": "Does the cake feature bold, graphic icing patterns such as geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs instead of realistic frosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake is rendered with uniform, flat colors without any detailed icing patterns like geometric shapes, stripes, or repetitive motifs. The appearance is more like a simplified, stylized version without intricate design. This differs from realistic frosting which typically involves complex textures and variations. Thus, the cake in Image B does not feature the described bold, graphic icing patterns.",

      "question": "Are the balloons composed of vivid monochrome dots rather than solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons appear as large solid color blocks that differ significantly from the vivid monochrome dots. The edited image focuses on simplified, bold color usage typical of pop art styles which do not involve detailed dot work. Therefore, the balloons are not composed of vivid monochrome dots.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the table rendered as a flat, solid color block without texture or gradient?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the table is rendered in a single, flat color without any texture or gradient, aligning with the style of flat color usage seen in pop art. This lack of texture contrasts with Image A's more realistic representation and depicts a simplified version typical of pop art characteristics.",

      "question": "Is the vase depicted as a solid color block without visible texture or design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase is rendered in a single color without any intricate texture, design, or gradient that would be present in a realistic depiction. It appears as a flat, solid color block, which is a common feature in stylized, pop art-influenced images where detailed features are minimized.",

      "question": "Does the candle flame have exaggerated sharp lines and bright, saturated colors instead of a natural, soft glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candle flame is depicted with exaggerated bright and saturated colors, missing the gentle gradients and soft glow typically associated with realistic flames. The lack of natural features aligns with the pop art style's exaggerated and simplistic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit characteristics of pop art, including flat colors, bold outlines, and stylized forms across all elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays distinct characteristics of pop art which include the use of flat, bright colors and stylized forms. The image lacks realistic detail, featuring solid blocks of color and simplified elements, which are key identifiers of pop art style, emphasizing boldness and abstraction.",
