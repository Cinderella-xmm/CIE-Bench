      "question": "Has the jeans been transformed into a perfume bottle shape that maintains the flared leg silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a perfume bottle with a sleek design and a wider base, resembling an elongated form. From world knowledge, jeans have a distinctive flared leg silhouette which gives them a wide and gradual expansion from the knee to the hem. Although the perfume bottle maintains an elegant form with a wider base, it does not emulate the specific flared shape of jeans. The bottle does not exhibit a gradual widening similar to flared jeans. Thus, the bottle does not maintain the flared leg silhouette typical to jeans.",

      "question": "Is the bottle made of transparent glass tinted with denim blue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bottle that has a transparent quality with a blue tint, resembling the color of denim. Normally, denim blue is a medium shade of blue associated with jeans. From the visual cues in Image B, the bottle indeed seems to fit both criteria: it is made of transparent glass, and the color matches a typical denim blue shade.",

      "question": "Have the back pockets been replaced with embossed metallic branding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B does not show any visible features akin to the back pockets seen on a pair of jeans. There is a metallic emblem on the front of the bottle, which resembles branding found on fashion items. Based on common fashion concepts, embossed metallic branding on a product like a perfume bottle substitutes for logos typically found on denim products. Since the pockets are a defining part of jeans that have not been replicated on the bottle, it indicates a difference in design elements.",

      "question": "Is there a silver button-style cap at the top of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the bottle in Image B has a distinctly designed cap that appears to be made from a silver-like material. In fashion terminology for jeans, button-style could imply a metallic circular closure. While the bottle cap has intricate designs, it structurally resembles what could be considered a button-style cap due to its circular top which is characteristic of button styles.",

      "question": "Are lace-up details present along the side of the bottle, matching the position of the original jeans' laces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle with smooth sides without any lace-up details. Typically, jeans with lace-up features would have visible strings or lacing holes, adding decorative elements along the sides. The absence of such lace-like details in the structure of the bottle suggests they aren't present, indicating a lack of transition from the original jeans' design.",
