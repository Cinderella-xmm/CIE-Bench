      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi tech mascot in Image B features a color scheme consistent with the phone in Image A. Both utilize a similar shade of reddish-brown.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi tech mascot in Image B does not have elongated legs; rather, it follows the typical chibi style where proportions are exaggerated, such as having a notably large head and shorter legs. This style deliberately contrasts with natural proportions, making the legs appear short relative to the overall body size.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi tech mascot in Image B is seen wearing sleek glasses and minimalist sneakers. However, there is no indication that the mascot is holding a tablet or stylus. Instead, elements such as sneakers and glasses align with the modern tech image, but the absence of a tablet or stylus means that the full condition isn't met.",

      "explanation": "The chibi tech mascot in Image B has a pin on its shirt featuring what appears to be a logo or symbol.
