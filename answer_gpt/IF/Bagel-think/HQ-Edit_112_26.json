      "question": "Is the cat depicted as part of a collectible figurine box design labeled \"Majestic Window\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine box is labeled 'Muddy Monic', and there is no mention or indication of 'Majestic Window' on the box. This is determined by examining the text and decorative elements on the box itself. Thus, based on the label and design, the answer is No.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figurine box shown in an isometric view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the box from a slightly angled perspective, but not enough to qualify as an isometric view which generally involves a more distinct angular view showing the front and side equally. This perspective primarily presents the front of the box, indicating a non-isometric view. Thus, the answer is No.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual examination of Image B reveals floral-themed decorations around the edges of the figurine box. These are consistent with stylized flowers on the corners and sides, clearly visible on the box, which typically enhance the aesthetics of collectible item packaging. Hence, the answer is Yes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a chibi-style cat figure with features such as a large head and small body inside the box. The figure has a glossy appearance, indicative of polished surfaces often used in figurines for a shiny effect. Therefore, the combination of these visual elements leads to the conclusion of Yes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cat figure within the box has large blue eyes which appear to reflect light, giving them a sparkling quality. This effect is similar to glass or gemstones that catch and reflect light. Thus, the visual appearance of the eyes supports the answer Yes.",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a depiction of a realistic cat positioned next to the box. The only representation of a cat is the chibi-style figure inside the box. Comparing it with a real cat depiction requires Image A, and it's missing in Image B. Thus, the answer is No.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the chibi cat figure within a box. There is no depiction of a realistic cat with detailed fur texture. Additionally, the natural wood grain seen in Image A is not present surrounding the figurine box in Image B. Therefore, the answer is No.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features controlled lighting and shadows that highlight the figurine box. The hands gently hold the box in a style typical of product photography aiming for an appealing presentation, demonstrating potential professional showcase techniques. Thus, the answer is Yes.",
