    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there visible flames gently flickering from the wingtips and tail of the bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wingtips and tail of the bird appear to have flame-like decorations with bright orange and red hues, characteristic of flames. This suggests that there are visible flames flickering from these parts of the bird, as they resemble fire in both color and shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the bird's plumage been replaced with iridescent, shimmering scales instead of solid red feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, the bird's body features more texture and variation in color that resembles scales rather than the typical uniform plumage seen with feathers. This suggests an intentional edit to replace solid feathers with iridescent, shimmering scales.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there distinct fiery patterns (such as flame-like designs or glowing lines) visible across the bird's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the bird with multiple fiery patterns and glowing lines across its body, mimicking flames through bright reds and oranges. These patterns create a dynamic and glowing effect, distinctly differing from natural feather patterns.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bird's eyes with an intense orange glow that resembles embers, giving them a warm and luminous appearance. This alteration provides the eyes with a fiery and supernatural aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch appears darker and smoother, with a glossy texture that suggests a material change from wood to a substance resembling obsidian. This transformation highlights a deliberate edit to create a more dramatic, otherworldly environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blossoms in Image B have an evident fiery appearance, surrounded by glow and vibrant fiery tones. This edit gives the impression that they are burning or emitting flames, which accentuates the overall fiery theme of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the burning elements (flames, glowing parts) clearly visible in contrast to the falling snowflakes in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flaming elements, such as the bird's wings and blossoms, are vividly bright and sharply contrasted against the cold, muted backdrop of falling snowflakes. This high contrast makes the burning elements stand out clearly within the scene.",
