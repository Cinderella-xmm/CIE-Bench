    "Question": "Q1: Do the zebra's stripes extend outward and integrate seamlessly with the grass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes appear to extend beyond its body in a creative way, merging with the background, which features a similar striped pattern, creating an impression that the stripes are flowing into the terrain. This visually suggests a seamless integration with the grass-like pattern, indicating that the stripes extend outward and integrate with the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the grassland rendered in a black-and-white striped pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the area that would typically represent grass is instead rendered with a pattern consisting of undulating black-and-white stripes, creating an abstract and non-naturalistic effect. This decision to illustrate the grassland in such a manner clearly deviates from the realistic representation of a grassland, which would be green and textured, as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image exhibit a surrealistic style, creating an imaginative blend between the zebra and the environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a surrealistic style by blending the zebra with its environment through the continuation of its stripes into the background. This imaginative integration blurs the boundary between the animal and the terrain, typical of surrealistic art where familiar objects are combined in unusual ways to challenge perceptions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there any abrupt transitions or breaks where the zebra's stripes meet the grass?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design shows a thoughtful transition where the zebra's stripes and the background stripes create a fluid continuity, minimizing any abrupt transitions. The stripes elegantly blend into the background which is patterned similarly, further enhancing the illusion of continuity without visible breaks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the zebra's original body proportion been maintained despite the extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "Despite the stylistic transformation in Image B, the zebra retains its original form and proportions. The extension of the stripes outward onto the background does not alter the physical structure or dimensions of the zebra itself. When comparing with Image A, the zebra maintains the same anatomical correctness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
