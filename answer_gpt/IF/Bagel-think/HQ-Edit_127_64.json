      "question": "Is the title \"Parisian Park Etiquette\" visible and clearly displayed in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title that appears at the top is 'SKPFEMNNALINCE PERSHIUR ANIE & E', which does not resemble 'Parisian Park Etiquette'. The letters appear jumbled and not coherent as the mentioned title. The visual cues alone suggest that the title is not correct as per the question, and world knowledge confirms it requires specific spelling of 'Parisian Park Etiquette' for clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the infographic layout split vertically, with the pathway acting as a central dividing line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout is flat without any indication of a physical pathway acting as a dividing line. Instead, the design is oriented with icons and text flowing from top to bottom and left to right without any division by a pathway, indicating that the central dividing line is not present visually or conceptually.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there stylized seating icons present alongside figures who are depicted as sitting in the \"Relax\" section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be a section labeled 'SONE', depicting a silhouette of a person sitting. However, no stylized seating icons are visibly present next to them. The image composition uses simple silhouettes without such additional graphic elements. Common infographic design knowledge typically includes these icons, but they are not seen here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there speech bubble graphics connected by lines to walking figures in the \"Engage\" section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has sections with silhouettes representing different activities, but there is no visible 'Engage' section nor are there speech bubble graphics connected by lines to walking figures. The visual content consists of icons and text without these mentioned elements. Infographics usually contain such linkages for clarity, but this image lacks those.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a camera icon in the \"Capture\" section that includes a depiction of the Eiffel Tower within its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icons are simplistic silhouettes. There is no mentioned 'Capture' section with a camera icon that integrates the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower image is prominently in the background as part of the general design rather than as part of a section-specific icon.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the infographic cool greens, and are the human figures represented as stylized silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a palette of cool greens as the background color, and human figures are indeed represented as stylized silhouettes. These elements are consistent with common infographic design principles, where color schemes and silhouette usage are often employed for visual clarity and thematic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text in the infographic presented in clean, elegant typography without cluttered or ornate styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text appears jumbled and cluttered with inconsistent typography, particularly in the title. The typography style is not clean or elegant, as required for clear communication in infographics. World knowledge on typography would suggest that typical infographics aim for clarity and simplicity, which this image does not adhere to.",
