      "question": "Has the body of the car been transformed into a sleek, silver glass bottle that reflects the original car's curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the car has indeed been transformed. It appears to have a highly polished, smooth surface with a design that resembles a bottle. This effect captures the original shape and curves of the car but in a minimalist and stylized manner that resembles glass. The transformation gives it a streamlined appearance, much like a sleek bottle.",

      "question": "Have the original headlights been replaced with faceted glass stoppers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the areas where the headlights would be situated seem smooth and continuous, with no indication of faceted glass stoppers. Instead, it maintains a sleek and undisturbed finish. In comparison, the original car's headlights were prominent, but in Image B, the space is not occupied by faceted objects, indicating no such stoppers have been added.",

      "question": "Is there a chrome-finish, gear-shaped lid on top of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the top of the decanter-like shape does feature a lid characterized by its chrome finish and gear-like design. This element is distinctly different from anything present in Image A and serves as a focal point in the edited image, contributing to the perception of the car being a bottle or decanter.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Datsun 1600 emblem embossed on the front of the decanter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area that would correspond to the front of the car, where an emblem might be placed, does not prominently display the Datsun 1600 emblem as embossed branding. The surface appears smooth and lacks the detailed texture or raised typography that would signify an embossed emblem. Thus, the emblem seems absent in the edited image.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the decanter design combine vintage styling (such as classic curves or script) with modern branding elements (such as clean lines or minimalist text)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design in Image B features an interesting fusion of elements. The overall shape maintains the classic curves indicative of a vintage car, while the edited form is sleek and minimalistic, representative of modern design sensibilities. However, there is no visible minimalist text or modern branding that is separate from the car's original design cues. Therefore, while the shape might suggest a blend, explicit modern branding elements do not appear independently.",
