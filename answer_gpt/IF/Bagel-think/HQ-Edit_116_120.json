    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle now presented as a scaled-down, highly detailed miniature 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is depicted as a highly detailed miniature model, indicated by its placement under a glass dome and the intricate features visible despite its reduced scale. Common sense tells us that such presentation points towards a miniature model rather than a full-sized sandcastle which we usually see on beaches.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sandcastle enclosed within a transparent spherical glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a transparent glass dome covering the sandcastle. Glass domes are typically used to protect and showcase miniature models or sophisticated items, suggesting that this is indeed the setting being depicted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome placed on a sculpted base made of mahogany wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a base that appears to be made of wood beneath the glass dome. Its dark brown coloration and smooth, polished finish are characteristic of mahogany, a common choice for crafted bases of display objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are fine, glittering grains visibly applied to the surface of the sandcastle to simulate a sandy texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the surface of the sandcastle does not show any glittering grains or a particularly sandy texture. The depiction is more of a smooth finish, making it resemble a sculpted model rather than a sandcastle with sandy grains.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are tiny, ornately detailed seashells placed around the base of the sandcastle model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a variety of small seashells placed decoratively around the base of the sandcastle model within the dome. The presence of seashells, given their ornate detailing, aligns with decorative elements typically seen in beach-themed display models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire model and surrounding elements have a soft, matte pearl-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B, including the dome and base, display a certain level of detail and finish that can be interpreted as matte. The sheen and detailing suggest a refined, polished appearance rather than a specific pearl-like finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a ceramic plaque with the words “Empire of the Shores” elegantly inscribed and visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plaque on the base reads 'Drhover Crstaions' and not 'Empire of the Shores'. This establishes the discrepancy between the actual inscription and the one mentioned in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
