    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the lion rendered as a high-contrast silhouette with minimal internal detail and strong edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is depicted as a silhouette against a sunset-like gradient background. The internal details of the lion are mostly obscured, and the emphasis is on the high contrast between the lion's dark form and the bright background. This creates a pronounced outline, typical of silhouettes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been replaced with an abstract gradient composed of smooth color transitions rather than a realistic savannah landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that consists of smooth color transitions ranging from blue to yellow, indicating an abstract gradient. Contrary to a realistic depiction of a savannah landscape, this use of gradient emphasizes abstraction and artistic expression.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are detailed grass textures clearly visible in the foreground of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass in the foreground appears more stylized and lacks the detailed textures seen in realistic representations. The focus on high contrast and silhouette style affects the level of detail, making the grass appear less distinct.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the acacia trees depicted as angular, stylized silhouettes with sharp edges and geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the acacia trees as stylized silhouettes. They appear angular with sharp edges, which gives them geometric forms, aligning with the artistic style of the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"King of the Wild\" displayed in a dramatic, bold typeface across the upper section of the image without overpowering the lion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text reads 'KIGN SF L' the BLADY in a bold typeface at the upper section of the image. The typeface is dramatic and bold but given the sheer size and centrality of the lion, the text does not overshadow the lion's presence in the composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the lion positioned centrally and visually dominant in the composition, ensuring it remains the primary focus despite other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the lion in Image B is indeed centrally positioned, taking up a significant portion of the frame. Despite the text and color gradient background, its position and size ensure that it remains the primary focal point of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
