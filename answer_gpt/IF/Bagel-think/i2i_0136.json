      "question": "Is the orange depicted as a rubber keychain rather than a natural fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an object that closely resembles an orange in color and general shape. However, it is distinctly different due to the presence of a metal keychain attached to it, indicating its function as a keychain rather than a real fruit. The texture appears smooth and plastic-like, unlike the natural texture of fruit peel, leading to the conclusion that it is a representation of a fruit rather than an actual fruit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the keychain still retain the original stem of the orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a green protrusion resembling a stem, which is a representation rather than the actual stem seen in natural fruits. Upon comparing with Image A, where the real orange features a natural stem, the keychain presents an artificial version, which retains the idea or image of the stem, not the original one.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain the glossy texture seen in the original orange?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth, plastic-like surface that differs from the natural glossy texture found in Image A, which shows the orange under good lighting to accentuate its glossy peel. The keychain has an even smoother finish typical of manufactured plastic products, losing the natural texture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the keychain visually recognizable as a citrus fruit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B is designed to mimic the appearance of an orange with its round shape, vibrant orange color, and simulated stem-like top. These elements contribute to its recognition as a citrus fruit, aligning with common designs for novelty items like fruit-themed keychains.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the keychain include a visible attachment point like a ring or clip for keys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the presence of a metal ring and part of a chain, indicating a functional design for attachment of keys, which is a typical feature of keychains but not present in natural fruits. This element is entirely functional and indicative of the object's usage as a keychain.",
