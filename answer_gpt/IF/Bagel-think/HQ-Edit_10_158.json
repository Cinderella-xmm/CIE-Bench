    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the hiking boot replaced with a finely carved wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a boot but is visually distinct from a typical leather or fabric hiking boot. It has the appearance of a wooden material, indicated by the grain patterns and consistent color associated with wood. This suggests it is not a functional boot but a sculptural representation, likely carved from wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the detailed panels and lacing of the original boot preserved in the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden sculpture in Image B replicates the structure and design elements of a typical hiking boot, including panels and lacing. These details are carved into the wood, mimicking the features usually seen in functional boots.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are light and dark wood tones used to replicate the original leather texture and sole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden sculpture in Image B uses variations in wood tones to simulate the different surfaces and textures found in a boot, such as the upper leather and the sole. This use of lighter and darker shades helps to create a contrast similar to that in a real boot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden sculpture positioned on a minimalist wooden shelf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is shown placed on a flat, simple surface that resembles a wooden shelf, indicating a minimalist design. The lack of additional decor or complexity in the shelf suggests an intentional minimalist approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are subtle grain patterns visible on the surface of the wooden sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the object in Image B shows visible grain patterns characteristic of wood, distinguishing it from the smoother surfaces of materials like leather or synthetic fabric used in boots.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the wooden sculpture maintain the robust form of the original hiking boot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B retains the solid, sturdy shape expected of a hiking boot, encompassing features like thick soles and a supportive structure. These attributes help in recognizing the form as a boot, despite being made from wood.",
