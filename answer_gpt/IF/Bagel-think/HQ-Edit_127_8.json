    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the entire castle scene enclosed within a transparent glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a glass orb encasing the castle scene. The orb is transparent, revealing the castle and knight inside, suggesting it is a miniature depiction encapsulated within a spherical glass structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stone textures on the castle walls visibly smaller and more detailed, consistent with a minified appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone textures and overall wall details appear finer and more intricate, aligning with a miniature or model-like representation, consistent with the scene being inside a glass orb. This suggests an intentional effort to create a detailed, reduced-scale appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knight’s armor and the gate structure rendered in an antique bronze color with visible aging effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight’s armor and the gate structure are not rendered in antique bronze. Instead, they appear in shades of silver and grey typical of metal armor, with no visible aging effects, indicating a polished or newer appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small, fluttering heraldic flags visible on the battlements of the castle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does display a small heraldic flag atop the castle battlement, visible in the scene within the glass orb. This flag is part of the detailed elements that convey the miniature castle scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small turrets and crenellated walls arranged in a circular pattern around the base of the glass orb?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any small turrets or crenellated walls arranged in a circular pattern around the base of the glass orb. The base below the glass orb is plain without such features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are golden light rays visibly sculpted into the glass of the orb, emanating from behind the castle to simulate a rising sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have golden light rays sculpted into the glass of the orb. The light behind the castle, visible through the transparent orb, seems natural rather than sculpted into the orb’s glass.",
