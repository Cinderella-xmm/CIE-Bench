      "question": "Is the entire dresser constructed from LEGO bricks, primarily in brown and gold colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks, as indicated by the visible interlocking plastic bricks typical of LEGO construction. The predominant colors are brown and gold, matching the traditional appearance of wood and ornate embellishments, respectively. This stylistic choice reflects a recognizable attempt to emulate the appearance of a classic wooden dresser using LEGO materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the decorative patterns on the front of the dresser recreated using small interlocking LEGO pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows decorative patterns on the front of the dresser that have been recreated using small, interlocking LEGO pieces. These patterns mimic ornate framing styles seen in traditional furniture, achieved by combining different shapes and colors of LEGO to simulate complexity and detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the curved sides and legs of the dresser constructed using smoothly joined sloped LEGO bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dresser in Image B employs a construction style typical of curved forms in LEGO builds, using smoothly joined pieces that simulate sloped surfaces. LEGO bricks are designed to achieve various angles, and here they create a curved appearance by incremental changes in piece alignment, despite LEGO's inherently angular geometry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the marble top been replaced with gray flat LEGO tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the dresser in Image B shows gray flat tiles that replace the original marble top seen in traditional dresser construction. These flat LEGO tiles recreate the appearance of a solid and consistent surface in a color that visually suggests stone, consistent with LEGO's standard flat, smooth brick design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dresser placed on a neutral, plain background that does not distract from the LEGO structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a plain, neutral white that effectively highlights the LEGO structure without competing visually for attention. This is a typical choice for collectible LEGO builds or artistic displays aimed at focusing viewer attention on the object rather than the surrounding environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the LEGO dresser maintain the original two-drawer layout with ornate frame designs around each drawer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO dresser that captures the essence and structure of the original furniture style depicted in Image A, which includes a two-drawer layout with ornate framing. The design employs LEGO bricks to simulate the arrangement and aesthetic features generally found in traditional pieces of furniture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all surfaces of the dresser visibly composed of LEGO bricks, with no realistic wood or metal textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consists solely of components visually identifiable as LEGO bricks, particularly through their plastic sheen and interlocking edges. This includes the absence of authentic wood grain or metal textures, which is consistent with LEGO's manufacturing materials and design philosophy, emphasizing versatility in aesthetic approximation rather than material realism.",
