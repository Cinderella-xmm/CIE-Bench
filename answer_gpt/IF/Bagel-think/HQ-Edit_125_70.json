        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle of the hammer appears to be smooth without any visible logo or branding.

Thus, based on visual cues and common practices, there is no logo present.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a pegboard with a grayscale appearance, and many tools or hardware items hanging on it feature copper-colored accents. Combining this observation with world knowledge, copper accents bring visual contrast against grayscale backgrounds, adding aesthetic appeal. Therefore, the depiction fits the description given.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, none of the visible objects behind the tools resemble a business card in terms of size or placement. Typically, business cards are small, rectangular, and would likely be obscured in a busy workshop setting. No objects in the background fit this description.",

While Image B shows color modification, the overall tool arrangement remains consistent, aligning with the initial layout. Using world knowledge, typically tools are organized in specific spots for functionality, and any changes would involve repositioning.",
