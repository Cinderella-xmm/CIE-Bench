      "question": "Is the entire canal scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is contained within a dome-shaped transparent boundary, resembling a snow globe or a decorative miniaturized display. This visual cue, along with the shape and shine of the boundary, indicates that the scene is indeed enclosed within a spherical boundary.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the timber-framed houses rendered with enhanced texture detail and colored in muted autumnal tones (e.g., browns, oranges, soft reds)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the timber-framed houses showcase fine texture detailing, although they are colored with vibrant rather than muted tones. The analysis of the color scheme based on common decorative miniature designs does not emphasize autumnal or muted tones, contradicting the description.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the canal water appear glossy and reflective, resembling a polished resin surface rather than natural water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The canal water in Image B appears highly glossy and reflective, which suggests the use of materials like polished resin often seen in miniaturized model displays. The mirrored surface effect is more consistent with artistic resin representations than natural water.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there scaled-down, detailed mini bridges and additional greenery (such as small plants or moss) integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, scaled-down elements such as miniature bridges and detailed greenery like small trees are evident, reflecting typical features of a scaled model or miniature village scene. These elements contribute to the realistic complexity and are indicative of detailed miniaturization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features small human figures in bright clothing, positioned strategically across the scene. These figures resemble crafted models typically found in decorative snow globes or miniature dioramas, emphasizing stylized representation.",
