    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the mountain range as a mythical beast with identifiable features such as a head, body, or limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain range has been heavily edited to present elements that resemble the features of a beast. Such elements include root-like structures that mimic limbs and a textured appearance that can be interpreted as the hide of a creature. The editing distorts the natural mountain shape to create a semblance of a mythical beast, with recognizable features that can be associated with a living organism, such as tendrils appearing like appendages.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the two highest peaks appear as large, curved, horn-like structures emerging from the top of the mythical beast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the peaks have been edited to introduce structures that resemble horns. These changes are evidenced by the root-like extensions sprouting from the summit, giving an impression of horn-like formations typically associated with mythical creatures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky surfaces of the mountains visibly altered to resemble a textured hide, such as scaly or rugged skin-like patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases significantly altered rocky surfaces that resemble the skin or hide of a creature. The texture has been modified to appear less like natural rock and more like the rugged skin of an animal, suggesting an intended transformation to give the terrain the appearance of a beast's body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible mossy patterns and root-like structures along the mountain slopes that resemble tangled fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly depicts mossy patterns and root-like structures on the mountain slopes. These elements add a fur-like effect to the mountain, enhancing the mythical beast aesthetic by simulating tangled fur along its surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the valleys been transformed into sinewy, muscular structures that follow the natural contours of the land but resemble biological musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B has edited features resembling a mythical beast, the valley contours do not have strong alterations mimicking sinewy or muscular structures. The focus of edits is primarily on the peaks and upper slopes, not on transforming valleys to resemble muscles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a visible earthy aura surrounding or emanating from the mythical beast, such as warm tones, glowing mist, or ambient light suggesting an organic, natural presence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although Image B introduces fantasy elements, there is no distinct earthy aura depicted, like glowing mist or ambient light, outside of the color and transformation edits to the mountain shapes and textures. The image's color palette does not emphasize an organic aura surrounding the beast.",
