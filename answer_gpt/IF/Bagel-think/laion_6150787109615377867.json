      "question": "Has the tabletop been replaced with a gear-shaped component featuring visible teeth and intricate engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop is not replaced with a gear-shaped component, but it does have intricate engravings on the surface. The round tabletop features intricate patterns, but it lacks the gear-shaped teeth indicative of a gear. This intricate design is more decorative than functional in terms of gear mechanics. Image A shows a simple metallic pattern with no such intricate engravings or gear-like elements on the tabletop.",

      "question": "Have the table legs been morphed into articulated, piston-driven limbs with visible joints and brass or copper-colored accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a table with legs that are metallic and sturdy but are not articulated or piston-driven. Each leg is a part of a fixed base with no visible joints or moving parts. The legs do have brass or copper-colored accents, but they do not constitute articulated or mechanically complex limbs. Image A has a simple, functional base with no such mechanical articulation or color accents.",

      "question": "Are there visible steam vents placed along the central column of the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central column of the table has features reminiscent of industrial design, including some resembling valves and gauges, but there are no elements that specifically serve the function of steam vents. These features have a complex, mechanical appearance but do not include visible openings or vents that would indicate a steam release function. Image A's central column is a straightforward metallic post with no such features.",

      "question": "Does the base feature intricate cog patterns and at least one rotating dial or gauge element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a base that includes mechanical elements, such as cog-like structures and what appear to be gauge elements, indicating the presence of intricate mechanical patterns and components. These features align with the depiction of equipment often seen in steampunk designs. Image A has a simple four-legged base with no such mechanical elements or details.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the metal table been transformed into a coherent, steampunk-style mechanized creature with integrated mechanical features resembling a living machine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B presents a table that integrates various mechanical components such as gears, valves, and ornate engravings, typical of steampunk aesthetics. These components do not transform the table into a creature but enhance the table with a mechanized, fantastical appearance. Image A lacks any such thematic elements, showcasing a basic metallic design. Thus, the transformation aligns more with steampunk style machinery rather than a creature.",
