      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible rectangular box that resembles a jewelry packaging box.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the interior of the box lined with a dark, textured material resembling velvet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the interior of the box appears to be lined with a deep, dark blue material that visually resembles velvet. Velvet is commonly used in jewelry boxes due to its soft texture and luxurious appearance, which are visible characteristics in this image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid of the box does not feature visible gold scrollwork. The box's design focuses on classic elegance with gold trim but lacks intricate designs that would match the ornamental style seen on the key's head.",

      "question": "Is the key resting in a compartment made of satin fabric inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the key placed on a plush surface inside the box, which seems to be made of a fabric similar to velvet rather than satin. Satin typically appears smoother and shinier, while the fabric visible is more matte and textured, resembling velvet.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible text inside the box reads 'Erale-Tlanet Elopese' in gold lettering, not 'Eternal Elegance.' The positioning and style suggest it's meant to be seen when the box is opened, indicating branding or special marking rather than being on the exterior's surface.",

      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key is indeed placed in the central part of the box's interior, making it the clear focal point of the image. This centralized positioning is visually effective for drawing attention to the key, emphasizing it as the main object of interest.",
