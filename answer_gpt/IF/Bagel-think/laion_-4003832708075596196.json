    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the tree trunk been reshaped into distinct arm and leg forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunk's form has been altered significantly. Visual analysis reveals that it now includes anthropomorphic features like arms and legs, suggesting a transformation into cartoon characters. Trees typically do not have limbs resembling human arms and legs, and the addition of these features indicates a reshaping for creative purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there leaf-shaped elements positioned as heads with cartoonish facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters positioned among the leaves appear to have cartoonish facial features, such as eyes and mouths. Common sense tells us that leaves do not naturally possess these features, indicating that these leaf elements are designed to represent cartoon heads.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leaf faces display visible cartoonish facial expressions (e.g., eyes, mouth, eyebrows)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the characters among the leaves clearly have facial expressions featuring eyes and mouths, which are characteristic of cartoonish designs. Eyebrows typically enhance expressiveness in cartoons, further supporting this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are hats and scarves present on the anthropomorphic tree characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual cues show cartoon characters crafted from the tree trunk and branches wearing seasonal apparel like hats and scarves. These items are commonly used to depict dressed characters, suggesting a playful, anthropomorphized tree instead of a natural one.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B analysis reveals speech bubbles near the characters, with text inside. While the text does not appear to be clear Thanksgiving greetings, the presence of speech bubbles indicates a communicative feature was intended, suggesting an interactive element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire illustration, including characters and text bubbles, contained within the original border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has incorporated new elements like characters and speech bubbles, but these additions are positioned within the boundary of the previous leaves and tree illustration. The border from Image A is still intact and encompasses these elements, confirming that all additions remain within the existing framework.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all colors used in the illustration consistent with the autumn palette (orange, yellow, red, brown)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B maintains an overall autumnal theme with the colors of the leaves matching the original orange, yellow, and red palette, the additional elements like clothes introduce colors like purple and blue. These new colors are outside the conventional autumn palette, indicating a deviation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the added elements, Image B retains the 'Happy Thanksgiving' text below the altered illustration, just as seen in Image A. This placement maintains its visibility and thematic relevance to the Thanksgiving context.",
