    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot exhibit a brushed metal and matte finish across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot model is depicted as having a smooth, metallic surface, which, along with the lighting in the image, gives an impression of a polished or metallic finish. However, there are no distinct visual indicators that explicitly suggest a brushed metal or matte finish. Since the design of model figures like this often aims for a clean and sleek look, it's challenging to definitively determine the finish type without specific textual or more apparent texture cues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robot displayed inside a hexagonal box labeled \"MECHA VANGUARD\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is shown against a backdrop that is part of the product's display packaging, showcasing a futuristic cityscape. There is no indication of a hexagonal box or a label that says 'MECHA VANGUARD'. The packaging layout does not present itself as hexagonal nor contain the specific labeling mentioned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are multiple weapons visible, indicating they are replaceable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the robot holding a weapon, and there seem to be slots or mounts on its body that could potentially hold different weapons. However, there are no multiple weapons presented within the image to suggest interchangeability directly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible detailed engravings on the robot's armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor plates on the robot in Image B are depicted with various lines and segments that could be interpreted as part of the design or assembly aesthetics typical of mechanized models. However, there are no clearly identified engravings that resemble detailed artistry or text, which would be distinguishable as engravings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are visible joint articulations present at key limb connections (e.g., shoulders, elbows, hips)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's design includes visible joints at the shoulders, elbows, and hips. These joints appear to be designed to allow for movement, consistent with articulated models that can be posed in different positions, which implies the presence of articulations at those connections.",

      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides a background that features a cityscape with futuristic elements behind the robot. This backdrop complements the model, likely as part of its display packaging, and serves as a dramatic setting, enhancing the appearance of the robot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the background cityscape include high-tech elements such as neon lights, flying vehicles, or digital interfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape backdrop is designed to appear futuristic, which suggests high-tech themes. However, the image does not explicitly show elements like neon lights, flying vehicles, or digital interfaces that are often associated with a high-tech environment. The visual cues of a futuristic city are inferred rather than detailed with those specific elements.",
