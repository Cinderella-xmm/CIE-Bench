      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate textures resembling decadent chocolate and shiny sauce in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sneaker features textures that appear to mimic those found in a chocolate cake. The main shoe body has the texture of a rich, chocolatey surface, and the shiny parts on the shoe resemble the glossy appearance of a chocolate sauce. These visual cues, combined with the world knowledge of how chocolate desserts look, lead to the conclusion that the sneaker incorporates such textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sneaker's contours in the edited image inspired by the fluid, natural shapes of lettuce?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker in Image B does not exhibit any prominent curves or shapes that suggest an inspiration from the fluid, leafy shapes of lettuce. The design focuses on a sleek, modern silhouette typical of sneakers, which lacks the organic randomness and wave-like patterns of lettuce leaves.",

      "question": "Does the edited image prioritize a visually imaginative concept over practicality in the sneaker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the sneaker in Image B exhibits a striking resemblance to a chocolate dessert, which is not a common practical approach for footwear design. This suggests an emphasis on creativity and imagination, prioritizing visual concept inspired by a chocolate cake over conventional practical elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the sneaker design in Image B, the chocolate cake is represented through the texture and color of the shoe. However, there is no visual representation of lettuce, since the sneaker lacks any green or leaf-like elements. The focus remains primarily on the chocolate theme.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sneaker design in Image B takes clear inspiration from the original dish, particularly the chocolate cake, but does so by transforming typical dessert features into a footwear design. This approach is innovative and unique, as it applies culinary aesthetics to fashion, demonstrating a creative interpretation.",
