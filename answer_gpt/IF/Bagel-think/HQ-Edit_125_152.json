      "question": "Does the butterfly have its antennae positioned or depicted in a way that suggests motion resembling a conductor's baton?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's antennae are extended and curved in a way that suggests dynamic movement, resembling a conductor's baton, which is often represented with elongated and flowing shapes. This inference comes from the visual depiction of antennae motion combined with knowledge of how conductor's batons are typically visualized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there faint sheet music patterns, such as musical notes or staff lines, visible within the orange areas of the butterfly’s wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the wings of the butterfly feature sheet music patterns, including lines and notations faintly visible in the orange sections. These elements combine visual cues with the understanding that musical notes and staff lines can be used creatively to suggest music-related themes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flowers around the butterfly have petals shaped like musical notes or arranged in a way that suggests rhythmic swaying?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals of the surrounding flowers do not take the form of musical notes nor do they seem to be arranged in a rhythm-like pattern. The flowers appear in a natural form without any explicit musical inclination, suggesting a more typical floral arrangement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the flowers rendered in soft, pastel color tones rather than vivid or saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the flowers in gentle pastel tones, such as soft pinks and yellows, contributing to this analysis. Pastel colors are lighter and less saturated, providing a soft visual effect, which aligns with the description of these tones.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text depicted above the butterfly is shown in a flowing, elegant script font that suggests sophistication and classical style, but it appears to say 'Bonie SicumoDecrid' instead of 'Monarch’s Garden Symphony'. Given the presence of script font but inaccurate title rendering based on available visual information, the primary mention of the specific title is not correct.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, it is evident that the butterfly and flowers are arranged in a circular or semi-circular manner, giving a balanced and cohesive composition. This arrangement is visually apparent based on the placement of the flowers forming a circular shape around the butterfly.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the proportions suggest it is in a rectangular format rather than square. This observation is based on the apparent dimensions and proportions visible within the image itself.",
