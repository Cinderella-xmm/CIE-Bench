    "Question": "Q1: Is the sock fully constructed from visible interlocking LEGO-style bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a texture and appearance on the sock that resembles the surface of LEGO-style interlocking bricks, characterized by a pixelated pattern that suggests a block-like design. However, the sock itself is not actually constructed from individual LEGO bricks, but rather simulates the look and aesthetic of such a construction through a visual design on a sock. This choice reflects a stylistic representation rather than an actual physical assembly.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the original black, gray, and white patterns of the sock retained using blocky LEGO brick shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the black, gray, and white patterns on the sock maintain a resemblance to their original design. They are preserved using a digitally created blocky or pixelated style which mimics the look of LEGO bricks. The shapes and colors are retained to a large extent, applying geometric, brick-like forms to create a similar visual representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the sculpture exhibit layered, three-dimensional construction with varying brick heights to create depth?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits a surface design that mimics the appearance of being constructed with bricks, however, it lacks evidence of actual physical layers or varying heights that real LEGO bricks would provide. The image suggests a flat or minimally varied texture rather than the pronounced step-like, raised elements among bricks that would contribute to significant depth. This visual effect is more about surface texture than three-dimensional structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tag at the top of the sculpture an orange LEGO brick piece?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tag at the top of the sock looks digitally modeled to present a similar aesthetic to a LEGO piece, using blocky, geometric designs. However, the tag remains a pictorial or stylistic representation rather than being an actual orange LEGO brick piece that would visibly interconnect or form a tangible structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sculpture displayed upright in a clean, minimalist gallery-like environment with no clutter or distracting elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the sock standing upright against a simple and neutral background. The environment is intentionally minimalist with a neutral color scheme and lacks any clutter or distracting elements. This deliberate setting promotes focus on the sock and aligns with a gallery-style display approach, where the object is showcased as a piece of art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the sculpture display clear architectural detail such as aligned brick rows, defined edges, and intentional structural form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design simulates the appearance of bricks with details that suggest alignment and structure, but it lacks the physical presence of actual architectural features like precise brick rows, distinctly defined edges, or a perceptible structural form beyond the texture. The representation remains in the domain of visual mimicry rather than real architectural construction.",
    "answer": "No"
