      "question": "Is there a top view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom right frame appears to show a top view of the glove, as it's visually presenting the open palm area from directly above. The bottom left frame shows the baseball, which appears to be a top view or an angled view from above, presenting its rounded surface prominently. This understanding comes from the visual information indicating the angle and perspective of the images, common in top-down portrayals.",

      "question": "Is there a side view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top left frame in Image B shows a close-up of the baseball and glove laying on the grass. The angle at which the baseball is shown appears to be slightly from the side, allowing the stitching to be visible and providing a profile of the glove's opening. The reasoning is based on how objects are typically shown from the side, emphasizing their profiles.",

      "question": "Is there a sectional view of the baseball and glove included in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, both the top right and bottom right frames showcase a sectional view. The top right frame shows the inside of the glove with what looks like exposed inner padding, and the bottom right frame shows the glove with a round section that's likely supposed to be the inside, as if cut through. Such sectional views provide insight into the internal structure, a technique often used in engineering and product design illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the views of the baseball and glove clear and detailed enough for product catalogs or sports equipment manuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B contains multiple views that clearly highlight different aspects of the baseball and glove, including external surfaces, stitching, and internal structure (sectional view). These views provide detailed information about the product's appearance and structure, which are essential for catalogs or manuals aiming to inform the viewer about the features and quality of the products.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors and textures of the baseball and glove accurately preserved in all views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the recognizable colors and textures of both the baseball and glove are effectively maintained across the different views, emphasizing the natural leather tones of the glove and the red stitching along with the creamy white color of the baseball. Accurate color and texture representation are crucial for visual consistency in product representation, which appears to be well-executed here.",
