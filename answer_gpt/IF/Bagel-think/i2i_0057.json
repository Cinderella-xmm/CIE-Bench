      "question": "Is the central figure in the edited image now a robot horse rather than a biological horse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure has numerous features suggesting it's a robot horse rather than a biological horse. Its body exhibits metallic and mechanical characteristics typically associated with robots, such as a shiny, reflective surface and structural elements that resemble robotics rather than organic tissue. This analysis is based on visual cues like metallic sheen and exposed mechanical parts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image maintain the same posture as the original horse, with its head lowered as if grazing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the biomechanical horse is noted. While the biological horse in Image A shows a straight lateral gait akin to walking, not grazing, Image B's biomechanical horse retains a very similar walking posture with its head aligned forward and slightly elevated, not lowered as if grazing. The visual cues suggest the posture is for ambulation rather than grazing.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have a silver-white metallic shell?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible surface of the biomechanical horse is noted to have a silver-white metallic sheen, indicating it has a metallic shell. This determination is made from the bright reflections and typical metallic appearance visible on the surface, which aligns with world knowledge regarding metallic robotic designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are exposed joint mechanisms visible on the biomechanical horse in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On examining Image B, there are clear indications of exposed mechanical joint structures on the biomechanical horse. The articulation points and interconnecting components are visually suggestive of mechanical construction, revealing joints typical of robotics rather than covered or fleshed biological joints.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse in the edited image have glowing red sensor eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head region of the biomechanical horse is examined for eye features. The current image shows red sensor-like features where eyes would typically be found, suggesting advanced visual sensors that glow, aligned with common depictions of robotic organisms in media.",
