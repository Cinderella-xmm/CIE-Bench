      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower and surrounding elements are depicted with bold, distinct outlines that are characteristic of a cartoon drawing. The edges are clear and prominent, making the tower and the surrounding elements well-defined. This style of using strong outlines is commonly associated with comic or cartoon illustrations, which emphasizes shapes and forms distinctly.",

      "question": "Have vivid and bright colors been used throughout the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a vivid and bright color palette. The sky is a bright cyan blue, the clock tower is rendered in shades of red and orange, and the greenery is a bright yellow-green. These colors are saturated and eye-catching, typical of a cartoon or animated style where exaggeration in color is often used to create a lively and engaging appearance.",

      "question": "Are the textures in the image simplified yet sufficient to identify the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, textures are highly simplified; the focus is on smooth color blocks and clear lines. There are no intricate details or surface textures on the clock tower or the trees. Despite this simplification, the clock tower is easily identifiable due to its distinct structure and shape, and the surrounding elements like cars and trees are recognizable. This simplification of texture while maintaining recognizability is a common practice in cartoon designs to achieve a playful, simplified aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the essential details of the clock tower, such as its structure and clock faces, been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the essential details necessary to identify the clock tower are intact. The basic structure, including its shape and the arched base, is well-defined. The faces of the clock are also present, showing necessary details such as the clock hands and numbers. This preservation of essential details is crucial in ensuring that the simplified version of the tower is still recognizable.",

      "question": "Does the overall image exhibit a lively cartoon style with the combination of strong outlines, vivid hues, and minimalist textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits features typical of a lively cartoon style: bold outlines define the forms, vivid colors bring the scene to life, and minimalist textures simplify the rendering of surfaces. The combination of these elements - strong outlines, bright colors, and simplified representation of forms - contributes to an engaging cartoon-like appearance. This style is effective in creating an imaginative and visually stimulating interpretation of the scene.",
