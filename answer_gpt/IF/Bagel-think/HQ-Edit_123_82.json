      "question": "Is the woman's figure stylized in a cartoon-like manner with exaggerated proportions or simplified features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman has been rendered in a manner that emphasizes stylization over realism. Her features and figure are simplified, with smooth, flowing lines and minimal detail, typical of cartoon or illustration art. This is different from realistic portrayal, which would include detailed rendering of textures and proportions. Therefore, the style can be categorized as cartoon-like.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, the wings in Image B do not appear significantly larger; instead, their size seems consistent in proportion to the woman's figure. The stylization may make them appear more prominent, but their size remains largely unchanged.",
