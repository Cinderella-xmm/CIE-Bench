      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object depicted is clearly a stylized 3D chibi character. The body's shape resembles a hot dog due to the bun-like structure surrounding it, along with elements resembling coleslaw on top, which align with the typical toppings found on a hot dog. The compact body and exaggerated features fit the chibi style, a style often characterized by small, cute statures.",
