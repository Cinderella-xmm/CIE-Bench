    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the dragonfly visually transformed into a non-realistic, ethereal water spirit rather than a regular insect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragonfly exhibits an ethereal appearance with its vibrant blue color and shimmering textures, which diverges from the natural, earthy tones and textures of real-life dragonflies. The transformation into a more mystical or supernatural entity is evident through these design choices, which suggest a non-realistic, ethereal nature, much like a water spirit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wings appear translucent with shimmering, waterfall-like patterns that suggest flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B display a clear, luminescent quality with a blue tint, resembling translucent materials. The way light interacts with these wings, creating a shimmering effect, suggests patterns like flowing water, lending them an ethereal, cascading appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dragonfly's body display iridescent, scale-like textures with visible swirling blue patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the dragonfly in Image B shows a bright blue coloration with reflective qualities. This iridescence, combined with the textural details that resemble scales and visible swirling patterns, contributes to a fantastical, aquatic-inspired aesthetic rather than the smooth exoskeleton typically seen in real insects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing, plant-like vines visibly wrapped around the dragonfly’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any glowing, plant-like vines wrapping around the dragonfly's legs. The legs are distinct and clear, lacking any additional elements or adornments that could be interpreted as vines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dragonfly’s eyes appear dark and deep, resembling the abyssal depths of the ocean with subtle inner glows or reflective qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the dragonfly in Image B are of a bright blue color that doesn’t suggest depth akin to oceanic depths. They appear more reflective and uniformly colored, lacking the particular depth or glow that would evoke an abyssal or oceanic quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a faint, misty halo or vapor effect surrounding the dragonfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall atmosphere in Image B has a glowing light effect and a soft visual ambiance, but there isn't a distinct misty halo or vapor effect explicitly enveloping the dragonfly. The background light and focus provide a soft aura, but not a specific misty effect.",
