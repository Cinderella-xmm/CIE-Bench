    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the body of each elephant been transformed into an elegant, curved bottle shape with a defined neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each elephant's body now includes a defined neck topped with what appears to be a cylindrical cap, suggesting the transformation into a bottle shape. In comparison to Image A where the elephants are purely ornamental statues, Image B exhibits a structure consistent with a bottle design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the elephant's ears now shaped like gold-trimmed caps positioned at the top of the bottle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephantâ€™s ears retain their shape but the presence of caps at the top of the structure indicated by the cylindrical closures suggests the caps serve a different purpose without integrating with the ear design directly. The ears appear natural and not as part of the bottle cap.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants been replaced with a glass mosaic pattern composed of small reflective tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back section of each elephant is shown with a distinct pattern composed of small reflective tiles, resembling a glass mosaic design. This differs significantly from the glitter-covered backs in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a clearly visible brand logo placed along the trunk of each elephant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no brand logo is visible on the trunk of each elephant. The trunks appear unobscured with preserved original textures. There is only a label present in the midsection area.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a clear, minimalist label present on the side of the body of each elephant. This label suggests branding and fragrance name placement, contrasting the purely decorative Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the edited image present a cohesive, high-end luxury aesthetic consistent with premium fragrance packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents elements such as a mosaic texture, cylindrical caps, and branded labels that align with luxury fragrance packaging design. The transformation of the elephants into bottles enhances the high-end aesthetic compared to the decorative nature of Image A.",
