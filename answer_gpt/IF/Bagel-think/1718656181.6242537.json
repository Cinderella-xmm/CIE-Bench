    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the explosion depicted as a mural painted on a beach wall, rather than occurring naturally in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion is depicted using bright, flat colors and a stylized, outlined form characteristic of art rather than natural imagery. These elements give it the appearance of a mural or an artistic interpretation rather than a realistic explosion in the sky.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the explosion and surrounding elements bright and neon-like, consistent with pop art aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are very bright, with vivid neon-like hues typical of pop art, such as bright pinks, yellows, and blues. These colors are more artificial and exaggerated compared to natural tones, aligning with pop art aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all major elements (explosion, clouds, palm trees, landforms) have thick black outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, every major element, including the explosion, clouds, palm trees, and landforms, is outlined in thick black lines. This is a common technique in pop art to make elements stand out by emphasizing their form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the palm trees stylized with exaggerated forms and bold outlines, consistent with pop art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees have exaggerated forms with simplistic shapes and thick black outlines, which are consistent with the stylized appearance typically found in pop art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are geometric patterns (e.g., stripes, grids, polygons) visibly embedded within the cloud formations of the explosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explosion and cloud formations consist of flat, solid colors without visible geometric patterns like stripes or grids. The design elements mainly focus on bold outlines and color fields rather than incorporating detailed geometric patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the island landscape been transformed into simplified abstract shapes, lacking realistic terrain details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape, including landforms and palm trees, is depicted using simplified, abstract shapes with bold outlines, lacking the intricate textures and details seen in realistic depictions. This abstraction aligns with a simplified aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
