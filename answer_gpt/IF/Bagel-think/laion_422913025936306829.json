      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the edited shirt design use vibrant, saturated colors typical of pop art rather than subdued or earthy tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are extremely vibrant and saturated, featuring bright colors such as electric blue, hot pink, and yellow. These colors are often associated with the pop art style, which is known for its bold color palette. This is in contrast to any subdued or earthy tones, which would be characterized by more muted colors. Therefore, the use of these specific colors in Image B signifies a design typical of pop art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are large, solid-colored sections used to define the muscular figureâ€™s anatomy, such as chest, arms, and legs, replacing fine shading or gradient effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muscular anatomy of the figure is delineated using large, solid colors. The chest, arms, and legs are highlighted in a bright electric blue with no subtle gradient or shading. This approach is typical in pop art where solid blocks of color are used to define forms rather than detailed shading or gradients.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the edges of the figure and surrounding elements consist of crisp, angular, or straight lines rather than flowing or organic curves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the figure and the surrounding elements in Image B are predominantly outlined with crisp and clear lines. While some curves are still present, the use of bold outlines gives a more angular and structured appearance compared to softer, flowing lines that would indicate an organic style. This contributes to the pop art feel of the design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the previously subtle or gold-toned patterns now rendered in bright, glowing neon colors such as electric blue, hot pink, or lime green?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the gold-toned patterns from Image A have indeed been transformed into bright neon colors like electric blue, hot pink, and yellow in Image B. This color transformation aligns with a move towards a vivid, neon-style aesthetic that contrasts with the subtlety of the original design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there recurring, stylized patterns (such as stars, waves, or dots) repeated across the shirt in a consistent and energetic manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are consistent and recurring patterns such as the intricate background designs encircling the central figure. The chaotic and energetic flow of these patterns, now rendered in vibrant colors, provides a sense of motion and visual interest, consistent with pop art's energetic aesthetics.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the central figure still clearly identifiable as a muscular male figure in a dynamic pose, with arms raised and body angled, even after the stylistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the bold color changes and stylistic adjustments in Image B, the central figure remains identifiable as a muscular male. The dynamic pose with raised arms and angled body is still clearly articulated in the design, maintaining the initial form and positioning from Image A albeit in pop art style.",
