        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene has taken on a painted appearance with smooth, blended colors and a painterly texture.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a painterly treatment typical of oil paintings, with thick brush strokes that give the impression of texture. However, there is no indication of any parts resembling horse hair or sand. The scene focuses on a tennis court with players, so the texture appears more abstract and blended with a focus on representing grass and the general surface.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings and other background elements exhibit a soft, blurred look that is characteristic of a painting. The oil painting style often utilizes a soft-focus effect to create a dreamy or impressionistic environment, making the background less detailed to emphasize the foreground.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features warm, earthy tones and a dramatic play of light and shadow, reminiscent of 19th-century naturalist oil paintings. These paintings often used such colors to convey the beauty of nature and lifeâ€™s scenes with a realistic yet artistically enriched perspective.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition retains its balance and harmony despite the stylistic change to an oil painting. The central focus on the handshake, with its symmetrical composition and clear interaction between the figures, remains intact, maintaining visual interest and flow within the frame.",
