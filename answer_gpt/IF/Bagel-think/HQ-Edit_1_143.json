    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the laboratory scientist depicted in a semi-cartoon style with stylized features such as simplified lines or exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist is illustrated with simplified lines and more vibrant colors, indicative of a semi-cartoon or stylized format. The colors are brighter, and the features, while recognizable, are not as detailed as in a realistic depiction. This is consistent with cartoon stylization, where proportions might be slightly exaggerated, and lines are less detailed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the laboratory apparatus (such as test tubes, microscope, and monitors) rendered with high detail and clarity to emphasize refinement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laboratory apparatus is depicted with less realism and detail compared to how they might appear in an accurate, high-definition representation; they maintain a simpler aesthetic, aligning with the overall semi-cartoon style of the image. This less detailed and more abstract representation is in contrast to high-detail refinement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors in the image teal and white, consistent with a sleek scientific aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme prominently features teal and white, which are colors often associated with modern and sleek scientific aesthetics. Teal is used in backgrounds and scientific displays, while white is prominently on the lab coat, contributing to a clean, futuristic look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image include multiple monthly sections, each featuring a different scientific motif such as molecular structures or data patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a structured layout divided into monthly sections like a calendar. Instead, it appears to be one continuous image without explicit divisions or sections marked by dates or month-specific motifs. The scientific motifs are present but not organized into calendar months.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there bold, tech-inspired headers (e.g., futuristic font, glowing or metallic effect) present above each monthly section?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bold text does appear, but it isn't necessarily associated with monthly sections. The text is tech-inspired, but without apparent monthly divisions, the association with headers also distinguishing calendar months is absent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are data visualization patterns (e.g., circular diagrams, grid layouts, or flowcharts) visibly integrated into the calendar design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows circular diagrams and other scientific data visualization patterns integrated into the overall scene. However, these are not specifically part of a calendar design but rather elements of the laboratory environment depicted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image display a polished, reflective appearance consistent with high-quality gloss paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit a polished, reflective appearance typical of high-quality gloss paper. It has a flatter, more matte finish characteristic of digital or semi-cartoon illustrations, lacking the shine or gloss typically associated with printed materials like high-quality photos.",
