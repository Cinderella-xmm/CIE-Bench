        "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area corresponding to the bread slices in Image A is covered with non-naturalistic colors like red and bold patterns, with exaggerated outlines.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muffin liners are portrayed with bright yellow tops and circular, black bases but are not explicitly shown with distinct geometric patterns like triangles or squares.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are depicted using abstract circular shapes with blue and white colors, which are used to create a more simplified and stylized representation rather than a detailed and realistic one. These forms align with abstract, non-representational style changes.",
