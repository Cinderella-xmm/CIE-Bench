      "question": "Is the bridge transformed into a creature resembling an ancient forest guardian, with organic features replacing mechanical ones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge has been altered to resemble a creature with features that could be associated with an ancient forest guardian. The central part of the bridge now has organic textures and forms, such as limbs covered in foliage and glowing eyes, which suggest a living entity rather than a mechanical structure. This transformation aligns with a common fantasy trope of forest guardians having a blend of natural and mystical characteristics.",

      "question": "Are the bridge towers transformed into wooden limbs covered in foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure that initially resembles vertical towers has been altered to look like long, limb-like formations covered with foliage. These resemble the limbs of the creature indicated in the image, diverging from the mechanical towers in Image A. With the presence of these changes, it suggests they have been transformed into features resembling wooden limbs, enhancing the creature-like transformation.",

      "question": "Are the bridge arches reshaped into a ribcage-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bridge areas do not appear to include arches reshaped into a ribcage-like structure. The transformation focuses more on creating a creature-like figure with limbs and a head rather than altering the arches around the bridge structure itself. Therefore, the primary structural component has not been changed to mimic a ribcage.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bridge cables replaced with vine-like tendrils that support the creatureâ€™s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suspension cables, originally visible in Image A, have been replaced with vine-like textures that align with the organic themes of the creature. This transformation suggests a fantasy adaptation where the cables take the form of vines, fitting the overall theme of a forest guardian's creature-like features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the stone bases replaced with moss-covered roots extending into the flowing stream?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the bridge which should rest against the streambed has not been significantly transformed to appear as moss-covered roots. The base structures appear largely unchanged in the context of supporting the creature's form, meaning that this aspect remains consistent with the stone aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the creature have a head made of bark texture with glowing emerald eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable head-like feature that appears to have a bark-like texture, consistent with fairytale representations of forest creatures or guardians. Additionally, this head has striking glowing emerald eyes, adding a mystical and magical element to the creature. Such features are common in fantasy depictions where creatures have elements that are part of the forest ecosystem.",
