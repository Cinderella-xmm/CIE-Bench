      "question": "Is the edited image presented as a two-page comic spread with distinct left and right panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows two distinct panels that have the appearance of comic pages, with a noticeable separation between the left and right scenes. This setup typically represents a two-page comic spread.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the swirling energy blast contain visible eyes and a mischievous grin, indicating it has been anthropomorphized into a sentient spirit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not show any visible eyes or a mischievous grin within the swirling energy blast. The energy appears more like a non-anthropomorphized, powerful force rather than a sentient spirit.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no visible anthropomorphized spirit with eyes and a grin in the first panel, it cannot be considered the central focus. The panel shows a character associated with swirling energy.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second panel depicts a character channeling energy, but there is no clear portrayal of a spirit merging with an opposing force. The visual focus is more on the character and energy emanating.",
