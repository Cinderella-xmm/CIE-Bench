    "Question": "Q1: Is the wall clock still visible after the edit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is a castle hall with stone walls and a wooden door. A large wall clock would usually be positioned on an interior wall in a modern setting, not typically found in a castle hall. Examining Image B reveals no presence of a wall clock, as the image focuses primarily on architectural details like stone arches and a door. Thus, based on the visual cues of Image B, the wall clock is not visible.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the wooden cabinet still visible in the edited image?",
