      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bird that is clearly stylized and illustrated, lacking the realistic details that characterize photorealistic images.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typographic element is located at the lower portion of the design rather than the top. This kind of placement can often be found in commercial illustrations and packaging designs, leading to the conclusion that the logo is not at the top.",
