      "question": "Is the mirror still present in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no reflection shown, which typically indicates the absence of a mirror. Instead, we observe a piece of artwork occupying the space where the mirror was located in Image A. Therefore, the visual cues such as the absence of a reflective surface and presence of artwork lead to the conclusion that the mirror is not present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the area previously occupied by the mirror been replaced with a minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows artwork with varying colors, depicting what appears to be mountains or hills, taking the place of where the mirror was in Image A. This suggests that the area once occupied by the mirror now features a piece of wall art. The visual replacement with art suggests this kind of change.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the minimalist landscape wall art appear to have a fabric canvas material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork in Image B has a texture that is visible upon close inspection, resembling that of a fabric material, such as a canvas. This is indicated by the presence of weave patterns commonly associated with fabric canvases used in paintings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon visual comparison of Image B with Image A, all bathroom elements aside from the wall area where the mirror once was appear unchanged. The sink, vase, lights, and tiles have consistent design and color indicating there have been no alterations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, aside from the main change of replacing the mirror with artwork, all other elements such as fixtures and decorations remain consistent with Image A, suggesting no additional changes have been made.",
