      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the core visual elements of Image A in the form of a glow-in-the-dark wall sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the core visual elements from Image A are displayed as a large wall sticker above the bed. The recognizable swirling sky, stars, and other elements from Van Gogh's 'The Starry Night' confirm that the essential features are maintained. Therefore, the sticker reflects the original painting. By combining the recognizable features of 'The Starry Night' with the context of it being a wall decoration, one can conclude that the core elements are indeed present.",

      "question": "Is the glow-in-the-dark effect visible on the wall sticker depiction, indicating that it would illuminate in dark conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visually indicate a glow-in-the-dark effect, as such an effect would typically be highlighted by showing the sticker in darker conditions or by explicit mention in the context. The image shows a well-lit room with the sticker clearly visible, but without any indication of it glowing or lighting up. World knowledge about common advertising of glow-in-the-dark items suggests they usually exhibit the glowing feature or state that explicitly.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall sticker is clearly applied above the bed on a prominent wall in a bedroom. The image shows a typical feature wall setup in interior design, where a significant or artistic piece is placed above a main furniture item, which is a bed in this context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bedroom in Image B has a large bed with matching pillows and blankets, placed in a way thatâ€™s visually pleasing and typical for interior decor. The sticker is placed on a focal wall, appearing aesthetically appropriate and logically consistent with typical interior design principles, which often involve making feature walls a centerpiece.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall sticker retains the swirling, vivid paint style characteristic of Van Gogh's 'The Starry Night,' indicating the preservation of the artistic style and aesthetics. The brushstroke technique, color palette, and overall composition appear consistent with Image A, showcasing the original's stylistic elements.",
