      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are not varied, and shades of gray, black, and white are prominent. This suggests that the image is rendered in monochrome or grayscale as typically colored elements like the horse, trailer, and clothing lack vibrant colors.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows large, fragmented words such as 'RIDES & COIVS,' which don't match the specified event name. There's also no clear indication of location or date/time specifics that coincide with the given details, alluding to different content.",
