      "question": "Has the Brooklyn Bridge been transformed into a colossal, humanoid stone golem?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the columns of the Brooklyn Bridge seem to have been edited to resemble humanoid features with a textured surface that is typical of stone, hinting at a transformation into a golem-like figure. The bridge's towers are visually altered to appear more rounded and anthropomorphic compared to typical bridge architecture. Based on these observations, it's reasonable to conclude that there has been an intention to transform the bridge into something resembling a stone golem.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the twin spires of the Brooklyn Bridge been reshaped into arms extending from the golem's shoulders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the bridge’s towers do not visually resemble arms extending from shoulders; they remain connected at the top without depicting any articulated form suggesting arms. The towers maintain their vertical alignment typical of bridge architecture, thus, they are not reshaped into arms.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bridge's cables depicted as sinewy tendons wrapped around the golem’s broad chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the cables are observed maintaining their original alignment as bridge suspensions and do not appear to be edited to resemble sinewy tendons wrapping around a chest. Their position and linear arrangement are consistent with serving structural purposes rather than ornamental or anatomical roles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the Freedom Tower been transformed into a tall, crystalline crown positioned on the golem's head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Freedom Tower is seen prominently in the background and retains its architectural shape and structure without resembling any form of a crown positioned on an anthropomorphic figure. It maintains its identity as a skyscraper rather than being transformed into a crown.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the surrounding skyscrapers been transformed into intricate armor plating covering parts of the golem’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the surrounding skyscrapers maintain their typical architectural forms and structures without appearing as armor plating on the bridge or the golem-like figure. They are positioned as background elements of the urban skyline and do not contribute to any visible transformation into armor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the golem stand in a majestic, upright, and firmly anchored stance, dominating the cityscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the bridge's towers appear transformed into a more anthropomorphic form resembling a golem, it does not exhibit an upright stance as would be expected of a humanoid figure. The bridge maintains its structural position typical of an inanimate object anchored in place, not dominantly standing over the city. The overall composition doesn't support the golem's stance as dominating.",
