      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows visible snow accumulation on the roof and railing of the clock tower, with patches of snow on the top and edges, suggesting a winter landscape. The clouds in the sky above are fluffy, typical in paintings of snowy scenery, enhancing the winter effect. Therefore, the added snow is clear. ",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flags have changed from two-tone green-yellow stripes to a pale blue and white-striped appearance. These colors can be associated with ice and snow, implying that they were altered to include icy patterns compared to Image A, which had green and yellow contrasting stripes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of snow on the clock tower's surface and the color shift of the flags to icy tones signifies a winter theme in the scene depicted in Image B. Snow-covered landscape and cooler colors suggest the environment has been transformed to reflect winter conditions.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, snow is visibly accumulating on the top part of the clock tower, the edges, and the railing, which is consistent with a snowy setting. Snow accumulation is a common feature in winter environments, indicating the changed season in the image.",
