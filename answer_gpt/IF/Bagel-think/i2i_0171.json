      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the skier's exact pose from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B depicts a skier in a similar stance to Image A, but there are differences in the position and angle of the body and limbs. In Image B, the figurine appears to be in a more forward-leaning and less dynamic position compared to the action-packed pose in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the skis designed to be detachable from the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible mechanism or indication that suggests the skis can be removed or detached from the figurine. Typically, if the skis were detachable, there would be visible joints or connectors showing separation capability, which are not present.",

      "question": "Is there a magnetic snow powder base attached to the figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine inside a box with a background that resembles snow. However, there is no indication of a separate base that has a magnetic snow powder effect. Such effects would usually be explicitly displayed or stated, which is not apparent here.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box features illustrations and text around the figurine display area, including printed graphics and design elements on the packaging itself, thereby enhancing the visual appeal and branding of the product.",

      "question": "Does the figurine include details like ski poles and a backpack if they were part of the skier's original pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine includes ski poles and a backpack, which are consistent with the details seen in the skier's original pose in Image A. This suggests attention to detail in replicating elements from the original image.",
