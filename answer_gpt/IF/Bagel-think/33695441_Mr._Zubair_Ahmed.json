      "question": "Does the edited image depict the spiral staircase as a serpent creature rather than a standard architectural structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the edited railing of the spiral staircase resembles the scales and curves characteristic of a serpent, with textures and patterns that deviate from typical architectural design. These modifications, combined with the natural spiral of the staircase, create the impression of a serpent-like creature, influenced by its sinuous forms and textures. Thus, the staircase resembles a serpent rather than just a standard architectural element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steps of the staircase appear as segmented scales, forming a pattern consistent with reptilian skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the steps maintain their original architectural appearance without any modifications or textures indicating segmented scales or reptilian patterns. They do not visually match with any reptilian skin textures; instead, they retain the typical look of stone steps found in a staircase.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the railing been transformed into a spine-like structure with vertebrae or bone-like segments that follow the spiral path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the railing has been edited to include patterns and shapes that are reminiscent of scales but not vertebrae or bone-like segments. The patterns more closely resemble those found on the skin or surface of a snake rather than any skeletal structure or spine.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible wooden patterns or textures resembling a skeletal framework integrated into the serpent's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals modified patterns in the edited railing, which resemble reptilian scales rather than wooden or skeletal frameworks. The edited patterns evoke the appearance of an organic surface akin to scales, which are characteristic of serpent skin, further enhancing the serpentine imagery in the edited scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there stone-like ridges or raised, rocky textures running along the body of the serpent creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the serpentine revisions focus primarily on the railing with scale-like textures, lacking any stone-like ridges or rocky textures that typically signify a rugged terrain or geological formation. The absence of such rocky patterns indicates that there are no stone-like features in the depiction of the serpent.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the spirals of the staircase rendered as graceful, continuous coils resembling those of a serpent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B truly highlights the spiral staircase as akin to a serpent through its graceful, flowing coils. These edits contribute to a visual representation of fluid movements and curvature characteristic of serpents, as demonstrated by the seamlessly edited layers of the spiral in the staircase structure, enhancing the sinuous and serpentine form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent creature exhibit visual traits suggesting antiquity and natural grandeur (such as weathered textures, earthy colors, or organic forms)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the editing enhances the railing with textures and colors that give off a natural and organic appearance seen in serpentine forms. These traits, including the earthy tones and scale-like textures, combined with the elegant, aged stone look of the steps, suggest both antiquity and natural grandeur, supporting the imagery of a timeless serpent creature.",
