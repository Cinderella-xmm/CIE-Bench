      "question": "Is the room visually transformed into a thematic infographic with Victorian literature elements, including layout and design consistent with an educational or narrative display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various elements suggest a transformation targeting an educational or narrative theme. There is a scroll of text inside the clock case, a different painting with what seems to be historical or thematic imagery, and papers or documents placed on the floor with scripts, resembling an infographic presentation. These changes incorporate typical Victorian literature aesthetics and present the room with an educational narrative theme.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face does not look like a traditional clock face. Instead, it shows various written texts and a black triangle, resembling a thematic transformation in line with literary or educational themes. However, there is no explicit indication of a book representation or animations like page-turning.",

        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork above the fireplace has indeed changed from a landscape painting to a different image that resembles a diagram or illustration. Although it does not depict a clear sundial, it shows a circular design that could be interpreted as iconography related to time, aligning with the theme of Victorian literature or narratives regarding timekeeping.",
