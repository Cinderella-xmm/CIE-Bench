    "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme remains unchanged with a red sport motorcycle and a blue vintage truck, as seen in the original image. The rider is dressed in black gear.

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a thick white outline around the sticker design?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly demonstrates a thick white outline encircling the cartoon objects and figures, a stylistic choice often used to define and separate sticker designs visually from any surface they are applied to. This bold outlining enhances the image's contrast and visibility.",
