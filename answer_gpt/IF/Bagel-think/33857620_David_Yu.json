      "question": "Does the edited image depict the entire alpine scene transformed into a unified, creature-like form rather than separate landscape elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a creature-like form is noticeable in the center, featuring a large entity with a translucent and glowing appearance that occupies the stream area. The landscape is partially transformed by incorporating this mythical figure, but the alpine scene still retains separate landscape elements like the snow patches and chalet. Therefore, it has not been entirely transformed into a singular form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chalet's roof visibly transformed into a shell-like structure with intricate, icy etching patterns covering its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalet's roof retains its original form, appearing as a typical A-frame structure with no transformation into a shell-like structure nor any patterns resembling icy etchings. Visual inspection confirms its unchanged appearance from Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the former snow patches now shaped like wings and rendered with a shimmering, translucent appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow patches are still visible as part of the landscape and have not been transformed into wings. The creature introduced in the foreground displays wing-like structures, but these don't correlate with the snow patches directly. This indicates that the snow patches haven't been altered with a shimmering, translucent appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rocky areas at the base of the scene appear as thick, leg-like structures covered in mossy textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocky areas at the stream base have not visibly transformed into leg-like structures. While the creature itself has some leg-like appendages, these are more associated with the creature than with any transformation of the rocky landscape. Thus, the rocky areas remain unchanged.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the stream depicted as glowing, luminous lines resembling veins embedded within the creatureâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stream flows through the landscape and is distinct from the creature's body. No glowing, luminous veins are evident within the stream or suggestive of integration into the creature, retaining its original form rather than transforming into luminous lines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the overall atmosphere of the image misty, hazy, and dreamlike, with soft lighting and a sense of otherworldliness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a similar misty and foggy atmosphere as in Image A, contributing to a dreamlike setting. The introduction of a glowing and mythical creature enhances the sense of otherworldliness, supported by the soft lighting and blending within the misty setting. These elements together indeed create a misty, hazy, and dreamlike atmosphere.",
