      "question": "Does the character display exaggerated chibi proportions with a larger head and smaller body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits the characteristics of a chibi art style, which typically involves a larger head compared to the body to give a cute and exaggerated appearance. This is a common artistic style for miniature figures and keychains. Based on the proportions visible where the head is noticeably larger than the body, the character clearly shows chibi proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the character standing on a shell-shaped base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character positioned above a base that resembles a shell, with the scalloped edges and curvature suggesting the typical form of a shell. This type of base is often used in figurines for additional decoration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi version retain the character's straw hat, red jacket, and cheerful expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character maintains the original character’s signature straw hat and red jacket, as seen in Image A. The cheerful expression is slightly harder to confirm due to the face being blurred, but the presence of the hat and jacket is evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the character’s features (like buttons on the jacket and belt) simplified but still recognizable in the chibi design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi version shown in Image B, details such as the buttons on the jacket and the yellow belt are simplified to match the style but remain recognizable as part of the character's familiar outfit. This simplification is a standard practice in chibi design to maintain key identifying features while adapting to a cuter aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base clearly visible under the character's feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shell-shaped base in Image B is prominently displayed underneath the character, supporting the figure. Its visibility is clear, as it forms a distinct part of the keychain’s overall design, distinguishing it from simply being part of the character.",
