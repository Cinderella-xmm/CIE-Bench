      "question": "Have the individuals waiting at the train station been converted into 3D chibi-style characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To answer this, observe Image B, which clearly shows stylized, cartoonish 3D figures—commonly known as chibi-style characters—standing at the train station. This transformation indicates a distinct stylistic alteration from the original human figures, based on their large heads, small bodies, and simplified features, aligning with the known characteristics of chibi characters. Therefore, the individuals have been converted into this style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style characters in the same positions as the original individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the 3D chibi characters are positioned at the station platform similarly to Image A’s original individuals, with relatively corresponding placements. However, without an exact overlay or direct comparison, slight changes in position are noticeable in Image B’s perspective. Thus, their placement is similar, but not identical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style characters retain the original outfits and postures of the individuals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B shows that while the chibi-style characters adopt similar color palettes and general themes of attire corresponding to the original outfits, their stylized nature requires significant simplification. The postures also differ, reflecting the exaggerated, static chibi style compared to the more realistic stances in Image A. Thus, they do not fully retain the original outfits and postures.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the train and station backdrop remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited Image B, the train and station appear highly consistent with their representation in Image A in terms of architecture, design, and the essential background elements. The train retains its historical steam engine look, and the station building’s structure remains unchanged in styling, although the overall image takes on a more animated tone, fitting the edited style. Thus, fundamental components remain unchanged despite stylistic adjustments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters display 3D qualities like depth and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters clearly exhibit 3D modeling characteristics. Their appearance shows distinct depth, volume, and shadowing, giving them a solid 3D feel. Unlike flat 2D illustrations, these animated figures possess rounded features with visual cues of light interaction and realistic depth, aligning with common 3D render styles.",
