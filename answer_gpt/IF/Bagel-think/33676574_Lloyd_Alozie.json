      "question": "Do the skyscrapers appear as integrated, articulated robotic limbs forming a larger guardian-like figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers do not resemble articulated robotic limbs forming a larger figure; instead, the image still depicts standard skyscrapers, with the addition of three robotic figures that appear suspended above the city. These figures are distinct entities and do not integrate with the buildings to form any larger structure.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible neon circuitry patterns running along the facades of the buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings do not exhibit neon circuitry patterns on their facades. The facades retain their typical building designs without such enhancements. The added robotic figures have some neon-like elements, but these are separate from the building facades.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the building facades feature reflective, scale-like panels arranged in an overlapping or segmented pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the facade structure of typical city skyscrapers, which do not exhibit reflective, scale-like panels. The facades are consistent with standard architectural features and do not have additional overlapping or segmented patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the expressways depicted as glowing, curving, spine-like structures emitting light and winding through the city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the expressways appear standard and do not give off a glowing or spine-like impression. They are depicted in a typical architectural manner without extra glowing effects or spine-like appearances.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tops of the buildings feature enhanced, fin-like vertical structures that resemble mechanical protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tops of the buildings maintain standard architectural elements, such as antennas or spires, typical of urban skyscrapers. They do not resemble mechanical protrusions or fin-like structures beyond their usual design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there rotating holographic elements positioned across the skyline that resemble pulsing, eye-like forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit rotating holographic elements resembling pulsing, eye-like forms across the skyline. The skyline retains its standard appearance without such added holographic features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
