      "question": "Is the bowl made of a transparent glass-like material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bowl that appears to have a glass-like quality due to a subtle gradient effect and refractions visible around its rim, giving the impression of translucency often associated with glass. The visual cues of translucency and a gradient suggest glass material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vegetables have a fresh and slightly damp surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cauliflower and carrots exhibit a surface texture that appears smooth and slightly shiny, which can be interpreted as a fresh and damp surface. The smooth texture combined with light reflections suggest moisture typical of freshly prepared vegetables.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image show angled lighting from above with soft ambient fill, creating highlights and soft shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays lighting that seems to come from above, evident by the soft shadows beneath the vegetables and subtle highlights on their upper surfaces. The lighting effect suggests angled lighting along with ambient fill, creating balanced illumination with highlights on the rim of the bowl and the vegetables.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a neutral gray with a subtle vignette gradient and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears neutral with a smooth, consistent texture, but it lacks a vignette gradient. The background seems uniform without any visible gradient effect, suggesting consistency in its color and texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the vegetables naturally vibrant with a soft glow effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the vegetables, particularly the carrots, are intensely vibrant and appear to have a soft glow effect. The overall vividness and similarity in tone to luminous materials suggest this effect, which enhances the natural vibrancy of the vegetables.",
