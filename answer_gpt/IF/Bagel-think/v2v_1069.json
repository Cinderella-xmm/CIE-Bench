      "question": "Is the ceiling fan enclosed within a transparent snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements clearly show a decorative object resembling a ceiling fan enclosed within what appears to be a glass dome, commonly recognized as a snow globe. The curvature of the glass, the refracted reflections, and the presence of thematic elements inside, such as snowflakes, support the identification of a snow globe. Common understanding of snow globes involves these characteristics, confirming the object is indeed inside a snow globe.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe rest atop a tabletop under soft lighting with a warm and minimalist background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the snow globe is depicted sitting on a flat surface that resembles a tabletop. The lighting in the scene is gentle, suggesting a soft lighting setup. The background is neutral, with shades of brown that offer a warm and minimalist feel, common in cozy settings. These elements combine to create a calm and unadorned backdrop which fits the description given.",

      "question": "Are there delicate shimmering effects visible on nearby surfaces caused by light passing through the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the snow globe is well-lit, there's no visual evidence of light causing shimmering effects on nearby surfaces. The scene shows a calculation of the snow globe's contents but lacks specific reflections or prism-like rainbows typically associated with such shimmering effects caused by refracted light.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fan inside the snow globe depicted in a playful, cartoon-style 3D design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fan, as seen in Image B, is adorned with an oversized and stylized design, coupled with its integration in what seems to be a quaint, miniature environment within the snow globe. This setup with snowflakes and small pine trees gives a playful and somewhat whimsical appearance, characteristic of a cartoon-style 3D object. Such design choices support the idea of a playful artistic rendition rather than a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are snowflakes visible drifting gently through the air inside the tiny room within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible symbols around the fan and the small house-like object inside the globe that resemble stylized snowflakes. While these figures appear to be drifting inside the snow globe, they do not seem to be inside a smaller structure like a tiny room. Instead, they are part of the globeâ€™s main interior design, which gives an impression of snow within the globe but not specifically confined to a small room inside.",
