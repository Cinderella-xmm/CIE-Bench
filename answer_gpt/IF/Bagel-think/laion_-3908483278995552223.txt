    "Question": "Q1: Is the Aquatic warrior rendered as a three-dimensional model rather than a flat 2D image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Aquatic warrior is represented with depth, shading, and dimensionality that indicate it is a 3D model. The shadows and the varying angle views of the armor suggest three-dimensional rendering. The base with coral-like structures also supports the spatial presence of the warrior, which is typically seen in models, rather than flat 2D images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "explanation": "Compared to the Aquatic warrior, the trident in Image B is still large and prominent. Despite the stylistic differences when compared to Image A, the image maintains its dominance next to the warrior, which is characteristic of such weaponry relative to the figure's body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the 3D model placed on a base that resembles a coral reef made of artificial or stylized coral structures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base below the Aquatic warrior consists of stylized coral and aquatic motifs, suggesting a theme related to the ocean or coral reefs. The design is artificial or stylized, as seen in figures and models which represent thematic elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there swirling, miniature water currents visible around the figure, suggesting dynamic movement?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit any swirling water currents or features that suggest dynamic movement around the figure. The decorations are static, without any motion implied outside the warrior and its base.",
    "answer": "No"
