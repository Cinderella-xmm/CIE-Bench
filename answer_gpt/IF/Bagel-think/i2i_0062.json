      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small, cartoon character is seen wearing a T-shirt and shorts. The visual cues indicate that the T-shirt is gray, supported by the shading and color tone, which aligns with common depictions of casual clothing in cartoon styles where color is simplified.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the proportions are exaggerated, which is a characteristic aspect of chibi art styles. The head is shown to be disproportionately large compared to the body.

      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of basic line drawings that suggest the outlines of buildings, resembling a city skyline.
