      "question": "Is the edited image structured as a two-panel comic strip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image consists of four separate panels arranged in two rows and two columns, each depicting a different scene. Therefore, it is not structured as a two-panel comic strip. Comic strips can have varying numbers of panels, and in this case, the layout clearly consists of four panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image feature bold outlines, vibrant colors, and exaggerated expressions typical of pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows bold outlines defining the characters, vibrant colors such as orange, blue, and pink, and exaggerated expressions, particularly in the facial features of the donut-like characters. These elements are characteristic of pop-art style, which often emphasizes bright colors and bold lines.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all donuts depicted with doughy limbs, expressive icing eyes, and sugar-crusted armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in the edited image resemble donuts with anthropomorphic features. They have limbs, faces with expressive eyes similar to icing patterns on donuts, and their design could be likened to wearing armor made of sugar. However, calling it 'armor' is metaphorical, as it refers to their sugary surface texture rather than functional armor.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble in Panel 1 containing the text “Guardians of the Plate, unite!” spoken by a donut character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, there is text saying 'HECHOPLE WOIPTS', but it does not contain the phrase “Guardians of the Plate, unite!” spoken by a donut character. The actual text in the image does not match the provided phrase.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 depicts donut characters, but they are not surrounding a coffee mug fortress, nor are they holding marshmallow spears and chocolate shields. The panel contains a single donut character with the text ‘TLOHOC HICITEN’ and a sword, with no reference to a coffee mug or specific weapons made of marshmallows or chocolate.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements in the edited image are rendered in bold, colorful, and playful fonts common in cartoon-style design. The fonts are stylized and add to the playful demeanor of the image, consistent with cartoon-style presentation.",
