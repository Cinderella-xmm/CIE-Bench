    "Question": "Q1: Are the calendar pages arranged into a tidy pile?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar pages are shown stacked neatly on top of each other, forming a clearly organized pile. This arrangement indicates orderliness, as the edges of the pages align properly and form straight lines. When piled up, the individual sheets create a solid block, suggesting they are carefully arranged.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates still present and unchanged?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar displays a highlighted date '12' circled in blue with a handwritten note 'Wedding'. The original image shows multiple highlighted dates and notes in various colors. Image B has only one emphasized date with a note, indicating a change from multiple to a singular focus.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the calendar pages and desk surface display convincing textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the paper of the calendar pages has a visible grainy texture, evoking the feel of a stack of thick sheets which is akin to how real paper appears when viewed closely. Additionally, the desk surface has a smooth, slightly reflective texture, which resembles typical wood finish in real-life settings, showing a realistic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there evidence of lighting and shadow depth creating a realistic appearance?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays shadows cast by the stack of calendar pages onto the desk, creating depth and a sense of realism. The direction and soft gradation of the shadows suggest the presence of a light source, adding dimensionality to the image, which mirrors the shadow effects seen in natural lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the colors and styles of the handwritten notes and highlighted dates been preserved?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the date '12' circled in blue and the note 'Wedding' in red writing, which differs from the original image where various colors were used for different dates and notes. Image B simplifies it to one color combination, indicating a lack of preservation of the original variety of colors.",
    "answer": "No"
