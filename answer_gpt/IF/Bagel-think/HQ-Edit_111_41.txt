    "Question": "Q1: Is the chair constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chair does not appear to be constructed entirely from visible LEGO-style bricks. The structure resembles a typical office chair with smooth surfaces and rounded edges, particularly in the seat and backrest. There are no distinct LEGO studs or interlocking brick patterns visible, which would be characteristic of a LEGO-style construction. World knowledge of what LEGO bricks typically look like—being made up of small interlocking pieces—further supports this assessment.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the seat and backrest cushions rendered in sleek black, resembling LEGO bricks?",
    "explanation": "The seat and backrest cushions in Image B are rendered in sleek black, but they do not resemble LEGO bricks. They have smooth surfaces and no visible LEGO-style studs or connections. LEGO bricks usually have a studded surface for interlocking purposes, whereas the chair in Image B appears to have a conventional cushion design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the armrests and base of the chair rendered in silver color?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the chair indeed appears to be rendered in a metallic silver color, which is characteristic of typical office chair bases. The armrests, however, are not in silver; they appear to be semi-transparent or of a different material or color, which is not silver. Observing the visual cues combined with world knowledge of typical office chair designs helps conclude this.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wheels translucent gray in color?",
    "explanation": "The wheels of the chair in Image B appear to be solid black rather than translucent gray. Translucent gray would imply some level of transparency or opacity variation, which is not visible in the wheels as they appear opaque and uniformly colored.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the seat and backrest composed of visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients between them?",
    "explanation": "The seat and backrest are depicted with smooth, sleek surfaces rather than visibly layered bricks with smooth gradients. In a LEGO-style construction, you would expect to see distinct layers or interconnected pieces, and such layered detail is absent in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the armrests designed as simple hinged parts without complex padding or curves?",
    "explanation": "The armrests in Image B appear to have a streamlined design with a semi-transparent look, lacking visible complex padding or intricate curves. Though they are not hinged parts in the traditional sense, the simplicity of their design could be interpreted as resembling a basic, uncomplicated form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the chair placed on a plain white tabletop?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the chair placed against a plain background which appears white, giving the surface the appearance of a tabletop. While details about it being a tabletop are not explicit, the uniform color suggests a plain surface that could be interpreted as such.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Does the image clearly highlight the geometric, modular construction of the chair through visible brick edges and clean lines?",
    "explanation": "The chair in Image B does not highlight geometric, modular construction through visible brick edges. While the chair has clean lines, these are due more to a modern, minimalist design than any modular construction. The typical indicators of a brick-based assembly, like visible edges of bricks or interlocking features, are absent, suggesting a traditional design approach.",
    "answer": "No"
