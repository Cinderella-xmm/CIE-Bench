      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image, the drawing clearly features a cat in a curled-up posture where the body is tightly turned inwards, which is a position often seen in cats when they are asleep or resting. This visual cue matches a typical feline pose for comfort and warmth. Based on this visual analysis, the cat maintains a curled-up posture.",

      "question": "Is the cat's fur represented by simple gradient color blocks in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur is depicted using solid colors and simple lines, as opposed to detailed textures or gradient color blocks. The simplified artistic style uses flat color areas to imply the fur without gradient transitions. This suggests the use of straightforward coloring rather than gradient color blocks.",

      "question": "Has the car been simplified to a curved surface with only reflection lines present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a car at all. Instead, it focuses entirely on the illustration of the cat, indicating that the surroundings, including any cars, are not represented. Therefore, the idea of the car being simplified is irrelevant to the contents of the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the sticker have an irregular shape with a thick white outline and a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sticker of the cat has an irregular, contoured shape that follows the outline of the cat and includes a thick white border around the edges. The white border is usually indicative of a design ready for sticker application, emphasizing the shape of the cat against any background. The image does not provide visual information on background transparency, but the typical design suggests the intention for such a sticker to have a clear or transparent background.",

      "question": "Is the entire image styled in a minimalist illustration manner suitable for a chibi sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cat illustration with simplified lines, solid colors, and minimal details, which are characteristic of a minimalist art style. Such a style is often used in chibi or cartoon-like stickers for its clarity and cuteness. The overall design supports the idea of it being a chibi sticker due to its straightforward, yet expressive, representation.",
