        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visual indication of a bicycle. The image consists exclusively of an abstract logo with text on a plain, vibrant background. This contrasts the original scenario where a bike is prominently visible in a natural setting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a very minimalistic design with a single graphic and some text on a solid color background, displaying a clean aesthetic. It eliminates all detailed elements present in Image A's natural setting, focusing solely on simplistic elements.",
