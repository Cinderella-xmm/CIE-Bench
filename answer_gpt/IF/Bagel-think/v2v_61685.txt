    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the layout of the edited image strongly asymmetrical?",
    "explanation": "The layout of Image B appears to be visually balanced and does not exhibit strong asymmetry. The elements in the image, such as the figures, are centrally aligned and evenly distributed across the design. This balance is not typical of an asymmetrical design, which usually has a more unequal distribution of elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the human figures and the background tent been simplified into flat graphic shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the human figures and the background elements, like the tent, have been simplified into flat graphic shapes. This simplification removes details and textures, contributing to a more stylized and abstract representation, which aligns with the style observed in graphic design where simplicity and minimalism are emphasized.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the colors in the edited image restricted to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt as an accent?",
    "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is indeed restricted primarily to blues, whites, and the green of the man's shirt. This limited color scheme serves to create visual cohesion and allows certain elements, like the green shirt, to stand out as accents within the overall design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrated in a bold, clean sans serif typeface across the upper cloudy sky region?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text at the top of the image does not read as 'SKATE FOR ALL.' Instead, it seems to have stylistically altered, abstract letters that do not convey this specific message. Additionally, rather than being placed across a cloudy sky region, the sky and other elements have been stylized without clear clouds.",
    "answer": "No"
