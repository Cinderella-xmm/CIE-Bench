    "Question": "Q1: Is the leaf enclosed within a transparent spherical container resembling a snow globe?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is clearly seen within a transparent spherical container.

    "Question": "Q2: Is the snow globe placed on a surface resembling a tabletop near a window?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the snow globe resting on a flat surface, which visually resembles a tabletop. There's also a diffuse light source in the background, which suggests proximity to a window, with the blurred background potentially being the light coming through the window.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the background softly blurred and contains warm tones such as orange or yellow?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a softly blurred background with visible warm tones, including hints of orange and yellow. These elements suggest a warm light source, possibly sunlight filtering through a window, contributing to the overall warm ambiance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Are there golden sparkles scattered within the snow globe due to sunlight filtering through?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), there are no visible golden sparkles inside the snow globe. Instead, there are snowflakes and a softly focused background, but nothing resembling golden sparkles caused by sunlight interaction within the globe is present.",
    "answer": "No"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the leaf suspended in water with visible gentle ripples and delicate snowflakes drifting around inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show the leaf suspended in water but inside a snow globe, which typically does not contain water causing ripples. There are snowflakes around the leaf, but not in a water-filled context. Hence, the leaf is not in water with ripples but within a decorative snow globe setting.",
    "answer": "No"
