      "question": "Has the ornate lantern been fully transformed into a jellyfish shape, with a bell-shaped body and flowing appendages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a depiction of what appears to be a jellyfish with a distinct bell-shaped body and flowing appendages, which are common characteristics of a jellyfish. The body looks translucent and possesses flowing tendrils or appendages characteristic of jellyfish, replacing the ornate metal and glass structure of a lantern. Therefore, the transformation from an ornate lantern to a jellyfish shape is evident.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the metal framing elements been replaced with iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils extending from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish features iridescent, ribbon-like tendrils extending from its bell-shaped body, which would have replaced any structured metal framing elements that might have been present in an ornate lantern. These tendrils appear soft and flowing, contrasting the rigidity of metal frames.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the glass panels been transformed into a translucent, bell-shaped body that appears soft and fluid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the jellyfish is clearly bell-shaped and translucent, giving off an appearance of being soft and fluid. This description matches the transformation from glass panels of a lantern into the jellyfish's body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original patterns replaced with glowing, swirling, organic bioluminescent designs within the jellyfish's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jellyfish exhibits glowing, swirling, and organic designs that are typical of bioluminescent creatures. This indicates that any original patterns from the lantern are replaced with such designs within the jellyfishâ€™s body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing, star-like nodules visible along the length of the iridescent tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, along the tendrils of the jellyfish, there are visible glowing nodules that resemble star-like shapes. These enhance the bioluminescent appearance and are consistent with this visual transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the jellyfish depicted floating in an underwater environment with ambient lighting, soft diffusion, and visual elements suggesting water (e.g., particles, light rays, depth)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the jellyfish floating with an ambient lighting setting. The background exhibits characteristics of an underwater environment such as soft diffusion and visual cues like light rays and particles that suggest depth, indicative of a watery surrounding.",
