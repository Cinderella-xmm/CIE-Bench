      "question": "Is the statue and its base fully enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue appears manipulated with editing effects, and there is no visible transparent glass dome enclosing the statue and its base. The background and surroundings, such as the trees and vehicles, are still visible and not distorted by any glass material. This suggests that the statue and its base are not encapsulated in a dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the statue been transformed into a sleek, metallic 3D figure with a reflective surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the statue has been altered with enhanced colors that may give a somewhat metallic appearance, but it lacks the characteristics of a fully transformed metallic 3D figure with a genuinely reflective surface. The details of the statue, such as its texture, do not exhibit typical metallic reflectivity or smoothness.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale trees with translucent or semi-transparent leaves surrounding the metallic figure inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the surrounding trees remain unaltered and retain their natural green foliage and typical full-scale size. There are no indications of small-scale or translucent trees, nor any glass dome that would affect the appearance of the trees in such a way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there additional small engraved plaques with historical text visible on the base of the miniature scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the statue has been altered to include enlarged inscription areas consistent with engraved plaques. These edits make it seem like there might be historical text added where plain surfaces or smaller plaques existed before.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the stand beneath the glass dome feature a polished stone surface with delicate vine patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the stand beneath the statue does not display characteristics of a polished stone with delicate vine patterns. The surface remains consistent with concrete or sandstone blocks, and the editing does not introduce any vine-like patterns to the surface.",
