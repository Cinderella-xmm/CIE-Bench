    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the jagged mountain peaks transformed into ancient dragon spirits with distinct dragon-like features such as heads, limbs, and tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jagged mountain peaks in the background of Image A are replaced by dragon figures. These dragon spirits feature heads with fierce eyes and mouths, as well as body shapes that mimic limbs, showcasing distinct dragon-like features. The mountains are no longer visible and have been replaced by arrant dragon forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mountain surfaces feature visible rocky scales that mimic dragon skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the dragon figures with armor and scales resembling dragon skin texture. The dragons are detailed with intricate rocky patterns similar to what could be considered dragon skin, complementing the overall transformation of the landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spines of the dragon-shaped mountains covered in moss-like vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there may be detailing on the dragons that could hint toward vegetation, there is no clear moss-like coverage specifically on the spines of the dragons. The dragons appear more to have detailed scales rather than vegetation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tallest mountain peak reshaped into a dragon’s head with clearly visible crystal horns and serpentine eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tallest peak in Image B has been transformed into one of the dragon heads, which features conspicuous horns and eyes. The transformation into a dragon’s head is clear, but the horns are not explicitly crystal-like in appearance, although they are visually striking.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the mountain ridges extend into sinuous, snake-like bodies that fade into the mist, with sections resembling coiled limbs or tails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragons do have sinuous forms that extend throughout the image, but the body structures are clearly defined as dragons, rather than resembling coiled limbs or tails of snake-like bodies that fade into the mist. The dragons do not extend in a manner that resembles snake-like bodies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the dragon-shaped mountains blend seamlessly into the surrounding misty, atmospheric environment without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a landscape where the dragons are integrated into the misty environment. However, the transition from the background atmosphere to the dragon forms does present a visual break due to the drastic change in subject and texture, reducing seamless blending.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the overall lighting and atmospheric quality (such as warm glow, mist, and layered depth) preserved from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains much of the atmospheric qualities like the warm light and misty depth originally present in Image A. The dramatic lighting and atmospheric conditions are preserved, maintaining the glow that permeates the scene even with the addition of dragon elements.",
