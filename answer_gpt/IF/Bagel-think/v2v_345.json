      "question": "Has the mouse been converted into a 3D voxel-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse's appearance is very different from that of a real mouse. It shows clear polygonal shapes and facets, typical of digital models rendered in a voxel style, which uses cubes for a blocky and simplified design rather than a smooth realistic depiction. This style emphasizes geometry and low-resolution modeling techniques, which are evident in the angular features and block-like structures visible in the image.",

      "question": "Does the voxel-style mouse model resemble the icons shown on the left?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the likeness of the mouse is changed to represent a simplified form with pronounced geometrical shapes and reduced complexity, typical of icons or simplified digital representations. This type of modeling aims to capture the essence of an object by using minimal detail and enhanced abstraction, making it reminiscent of icon graphics where shapes are basic and illustrative instead of highly detailed and realistic.",

      "question": "Was the scene rendered using Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a polished look with detailed shadowing, lighting, and reflections that are typical of high-quality 3D renders. Octane Render is known for producing such photorealistic images with sophisticated rendering techniques using physically-based materials and lighting. The overall appearance suggests a high degree of rendering quality often associated with a sophisticated rendering engine like Octane.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the scene rendered in 8k resolution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Resolution pertains to the level of detail an image holds. While Image B displays sharp features and considerable visual detail, determining an exact resolution like 8k (7680 x 4320 pixels) solely from image analysis is challenging without additional metadata or explicit visual indicators of resolution from the image presentation. However, given the clarity and definition observed in Image B, it could be consistent with high-resolution output. Without specific metadata or direct visual cues, it would be speculative but based on appearance, it could be high resolution.",

      "question": "Is the rest of the scene, excluding the mouse, unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the same setup with a smartphone lying on a wooden surface and the background remains consistent with Image A. Other elements of the scene, including the phone and table, do not appear modified in terms of placement, style, or design when compared directly to Image A, suggesting the rest of the scene is unchanged.",
