      "question": "Have the three sheep been converted into chibi characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of the sheep, there are three chibi characters dressed as cute animals with small and rounded bodies, typical of chibi art style. Chibi characters are exaggeratedly cute and child-like with disproportionate body parts. The visual representation of these characters matches this description, indicating a conversion from sheep to chibi characters.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the chibi characters are clearly wearing scarves, earmuffs, and gloves, which are bright and colorful, adding to their aesthetic appeal and indicating that these are implementations for a winter setting. These are typical winter accessories.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A review of Image B reveals that the chibi characters are drawn with a flat, cartoonish style and thick outlines, which are characteristic of chibi and cartoon art styles. This presentation makes them appear as illustrations rather than realistic representations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a non-transparent, illustrative background, showing what appears to be a fence like in Image A. Typically, a transparent background would show no visual elements behind the main subjects, making it suitable for sticker use. However, Image B has a colored background.",
