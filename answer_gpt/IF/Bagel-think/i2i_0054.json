      "question": "Is the background changed to a matte solid gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been changed to a clean, solid white color. In assessing the background color, the visual cue from Image B clearly indicates that the background is a flat, uniform white, not gray. A matte solid gray would have a distinct shade of gray, which is not present here.",

      "question": "Are there any visible shadows in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure of the elephant does not cast any visible shadow on the ground or background. Shadows would typically appear as darker areas relative to the surrounding surface, providing depth and context. However, in this image, the absence of darker areas around the elephant suggests there are no visible shadows.",

      "question": "Are the banana shape and metal stand curves highlighted effectively?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither a banana shape nor a metal stand are present. The image solely features an elephant without any accessories or additional objects that could include curves resembling a banana shape or metal stand. Therefore, there are no curves to be highlighted.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a minimalistic design without unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features only the elephant cut out against a plain white background without any additional elements. Minimalism in design often involves the use of simple forms and minimal ornamentation. The absence of a background scene or extra objects indicates the image has been simplified to focus solely on the elephant, thereby maintaining a minimalistic design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Image B, with its focus on a single subject (the elephant) against a plain white background, aligns with minimalistic design principles, which emphasize simplicity and focus. It eliminates all other distractions or details found in the original image, thus meeting the standard of a minimalistic design asset by offering a clean and simple visual.",
