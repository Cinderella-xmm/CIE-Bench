        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I looked for any text that appears prominently on packaging or signs. The text visible uses a playful, cartoonish font, but it does not include the phrase 'Jungle Friends Adventure.' The visible text includes words that are not legible as 'Jungle Friends Adventure'. Therefore, based on what can be seen, this specific text is not present.",
