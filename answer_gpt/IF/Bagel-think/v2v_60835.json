        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs display mechanical features integrated into their bodies. Their leg joints appear to have brass pistons and gears, indicating a fusion of natural and mechanical elements, which creates a steampunk-style depiction. This observation is based on the clear visibility of metallic, mechanical components where natural joints would typically be seen.",
