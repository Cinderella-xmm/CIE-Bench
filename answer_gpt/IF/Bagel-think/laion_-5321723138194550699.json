      "question": "Are bold ink outlines visible around all major elements of the car and scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image resembles a cartoon or comic style where bold ink outlines are typically used to emphasize major elements and distinguish them from the background. By inspecting Image B, it's evident that the car, elements of the background like the crowd, and other parts are all distinctly outlined with thick, dark lines which is a common feature in comic-style graphics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is halftone dot shading applied to at least one surface of the car or background to create texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone dot shading is a technique used in comic art to create gradients and textures through dots of varying sizes. In Image B, the visual analysis shows areas of solid color without the presence of dot shading patterns typically seen in halftone techniques. Thus, there is no halftone dot shading evident in the edited image.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all visible colors limited to cream, muted orange, and deep gray without any additional hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a limited color palette, likely intended to give a vintage or stylized comic effect. The car and background elements appear in shades of cream, muted orange, and deep gray, without any other colors. The restricted color use supports the comic-style transformation often seen in similar edited artworks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are motion lines present around the car to indicate skidding or rapid movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Motion lines are typically added in illustrations to depict movement or speed. In Image B, the stylized representation does not incorporate any motion lines around the car typically visible in comic art to suggest dynamic motion, such as skidding or rapid movement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble above the car containing an action word like “VROOM!” in comic-style lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Speech bubbles are a common feature in comics to convey dialogue or sound effects. In Image B, there is no speech bubble or any text overlays like 'VROOM!' typical in comic scenes to augment the sense of action or narrative.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the background been simplified to remove detailed elements such as spectators and fencing, focusing only on motion and basic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the style is distinctively comic-like with bold outlines, the background still retains a representation of detailed elements such as spectators and fencing, even in a simplified form with less detail compared to Image A. This demonstrates that while stylized, the background hasn't been reduced to basic elements devoid of spectators or environment context.",
