      "question": "Is the woman depicted in a stylized cartoon form with simplified features and exaggerated proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is indeed depicted in a stylized cartoon form. Her characteristics, such as the simplification of anatomical details and exaggerated proportions like the size of the head relative to the body, indicate a cartoon style. Such depictions are common in chibi or children's illustrations, where features are intentionally made larger or more simplified than those found in real life or realistic art styles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress visibly enlarged and accented with gold highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the dress are more prominent and defining compared to realistic designs, showing signs of exaggeration typical in cartoon designs. However, they do not appear to have gold highlights. The flowers maintain a flat, simplified color without metallic accents. Based on these observations, the patterns do not feature gold highlights.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit radiant or luminous color tones, such as glowing or highly saturated hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features colors that are more vibrant and slightly more saturated than those seen in realistic images, which is characteristic of stylized illustrations. The use of flat, vibrant colors gives a more lively appearance, contributing to a potentially glowing or radiant look, though not excessively luminescent.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are abstract, non-realistic bamboo shadows present in the image to enhance depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bamboo stalks have simpler, more defined features that align with the aesthetic of the cartoon style, yet there is no apparent use of abstract or exaggerated shadows to create depth. The background is simplified rather than using shadows extensively for depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a blank, bamboo-shaped writing panel framed by soft watercolor bamboo motifs in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is indeed a blank panel designed in a bamboo motif, with the edges softened by what appears to be watercolor-style bamboo leaves. This suggests the space is reserved for writing or text, combining art elements with functional design.",
