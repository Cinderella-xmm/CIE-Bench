    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the image have a white border surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear white border visible surrounding the image. This can be deduced from observing a consistent white outline framing the entirety of the picture, resembling a style often associated with polaroid or instant photos.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the caption “11:13 AM” visible at the bottom within the white border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the caption at the bottom of the white border reads '11:82'. The context suggests that regularly expected formatting like '11:13 AM' is misrepresented here, as '82' exceeds the conventional minute range in time notation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the faded effect been applied to the entire image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to have a faded effect applied to it, as the colors seem less vibrant and more washed out compared to typical high-contrast photography. This effect can often mimic aged photographs where colors degrade, lending a nostalgic or vintage appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image have a paper-like grain texture applied to it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible texture that suggests a surface akin to paper grain. This texture gives the image a tactile dimension, resembling how photographs might look if printed on coarse or textured paper.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the original composition and elements of the image preserved, aside from the added white border, caption, faded effect, and grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, aside from the noticeable additions and effects like the white border, caption change, faded appearance, and grain texture, the fundamental elements and composition within the main content of the image (the skateboarder and background) remain unchanged.",
