    "Question": "Q3: Does the cloak of the standing figure exhibit deep, soft folds with a dark, velvety texture and subtle light absorption consistent with velvet material?",

However, the texture does not precisely mimic velvet's smooth, dense pile. Instead, it has more sheen than typical velvet, indicating a textile with a slightly different finish.
