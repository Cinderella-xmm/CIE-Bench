      "question": "Do the sushi pieces form a clear figure of a person?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the sushi pieces are arranged on a plate to form a shape that somewhat resembles a humanoid figure. However, the arrangement does not fully form or clearly convey the figure of a person. It more resembles an abstract representation, potentially influenced by imagination or abstract art, rather than a literal image of a human form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the right arm of the person figure visibly lifted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, where the sushi pieces form an abstract humanoid shape, there is an extra sushi extension from the upper part of the body that can be interpreted as an arm structure, potentially resembling a raised arm. However, this interpretation relies on abstract and creative interpretation due to the lack of detailed human features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the figure include a left arm positioned appropriately on the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the layout of the sushi in the edited image, there isn't a clear or distinguishable structure that resembles a left arm positioned appropriately on what can be perceived as the body of the figure. The abstract nature of the arrangement makes it difficult to discern specific anatomical positions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both legs of the person figure clearly represented by sushi pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bottom part of the abstract figure does not distinctly resemble two separate legs. The sushi arrangement lacks definition and detail required to portray two legs clearly, thus resulting in an interpretation that lacks clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the head of the person figure represented by sushi pieces and distinguishable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a circular arrangement of sushi pieces that could be interpreted as a head next to an extended sushi line which resembles a potential neck, but given the abstract and creative nature of the depiction, this is more imaginative than clearly distinguishable.",
