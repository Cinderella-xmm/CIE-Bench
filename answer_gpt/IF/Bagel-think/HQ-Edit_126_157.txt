    "Question": "Q1: Is the image presented within a visible hand-carved wooden frame that encloses the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible wooden frame enclosing the scene, providing a three-dimensional shadow box effect. The appearance of the frame suggests it has a hand-crafted quality, fitting the context of crafted, layered art pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the boat, water, and hills depicted as separate, layered cutout elements rather than a continuous photographic scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat, water, and hills appear as separate, layered elements creating a diorama-like effect. This presentation is typical in crafted artworks that emphasize layers to suggest depth, contrasting with a continuous photographic scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the boat exhibit aged wood textures such as cracks, grain patterns, and weathered surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat does not show detailed aged wood textures. Instead, it signifies a crafted look typical of art pieces with smooth and simplified surfaces without the realistic appearance of wood grain or weathering.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the distant hills rendered in soft, pastel blue gradients instead of realistic green or gray tones?",
    "explanation": "The depiction of the hills in Image B employs a soft pastel blue color scheme rather than realistic tones. This stylization is consistent with artistic representations that aim for a soothing or abstract effect, deviating from naturalistic depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there visible, delicate droplet-like etchings on a transparent layer above the water surface to mimic ripples?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are small, circular elements on the water's surface that can be interpreted as droplet-like etchings intended to mimic light reflections or ripples. This technique adds texture and detail to the otherwise flat water layer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the foreground (boat), midground (water), and background (hills) appear as distinct, physically separated layers contributing to depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the different elements such as the boat, water, and hills are presented in distinct, separated layers contributing to a three-dimensional effect. This layered construction reflects a physical separation typical of shadow boxes or diorama art forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
