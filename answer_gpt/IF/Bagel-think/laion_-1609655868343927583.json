      "question": "Is the marble top replaced by a crown-shaped structure with visible gemstone inlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the cabinet appears to be replaced by a crown adorned with numerous colored gemstones. This conclusion is drawn from the observation of a circular, regal design resembling a royal crown, characterized by shiny and multicolored elements that are commonly associated with gemstone inlays.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the cabinet’s body been replaced with a fabric-like, patterned robe design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually depicts the cabinet's body as a textured, fabric-like robe adorned with small patterns. This is inferred from the presence of a draped design with diamond-like patterns and ornamental edges, resembling the attire often worn by royalty, as opposed to the wooden paneling observed in traditional cabinets.",

      "question_id": "Q3",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawers maintain a similar configuration to the original but are visually enhanced to resemble ornate belt buckles. This can be reasoned from the intricate detailing and placement that suggest an ornamental purpose, fitting the overall royal theme of the Image B figure.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the cabinet’s legs been transformed into clawed, regal feet resembling those of a noble creature or warrior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's transformation of the cabinet’s legs into clawed feet suggests a deliberate design to invoke the visual of a noble creature or warrior. The legs have been given a character-like enhancement with visible claws, indicating a shift from simple cylindrical wood legs to something resembling mythical or warrior-inspired attire.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the drawers now resemble openable pouches attached to the robe, mimicking adventurer-style gear?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the drawers are positioned in a new context as part of a royal attire design, they do not resemble adventurer-style gear such as pouches. The transformation aligns more with ornate belt buckles rather than practical adventurer pouches, as the drawers are visually rigid and engraved rather than flexible as a pouch would be.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is styled in such a way that transforms the cabinet into a standing figure characterized by attire elements like a crown, robe, and clawed feet, drawing inspiration from the original structure but enhancing it with anthropomorphic qualities. The features indicate a blending of regal and mythical characteristics derived from the cabinet's basic shape as a base design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the materials and textures consistent with royal or adventurer attire (e.g., fabric, gemstones, metal, leather)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabinet is styled using textures and visuals reminiscent of royal attire, including ornate gemstone decorations on the crown, patterned fabrics resembling robes, and golden-like trims. Although adventurer attire is typically defined by rugged materials like leather, the emphasis in Image B is more on regal elements, making it primarily consistent with royal aesthetics.",
