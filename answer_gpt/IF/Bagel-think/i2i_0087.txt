    "Question": "Q1: Does the clock appear to protrude from the wall surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock exhibits a perspective that suggests depth and protrusion. The rim of the clock does not align perfectly with the wall; instead, it's angled, implying a three-dimensional structure extending from the surface. Additionally, the shadow underneath reinforces the notion of protrusion, as it demonstrates how the clock is not flush with the wall. Measuring these visual cues against common perceptions of depth and protrusion results in determining that the clock appears to emerge from the wall.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the clock cast a realistic shadow on the wall behind it?",
    "explanation": "The shadow in Image B aligns well with real-world lighting and shadow behavior. The clock's shadow is softened and diffused, mimicking natural lighting conditions. Shadows typically provide cues about an object's size, shape, and distance from the casting surface, and this shadow, extending beneath the clock, realistically suggests the clock’s elevated placement relative to the wall. By comparing with real-world perception of shadows, it is evident that the clock casts a realistic shadow in Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the edges of the clock been modified to indicate it is not flush against the wall?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a distinct curvature along the clock's edges, which diverges from a flat, wall-mounted appearance. The edges exhibit a bevelled contour with varying shadowing, indicating spatial volume as opposed to a flat object. This characteristic suggests deliberate modification to enhance depth. Recognizing these modifications and correlating it with three-dimensional design elements indicates the edges have indeed been modified.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there evidence of lighting changes around the clock to enhance its three-dimensional look?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, light changes are evident around the clock, especially along the edges and where the shadow falls. These shifts in lighting create contrast and depth, crucial for emphasizing 3D attributes. The light source appears to be positioned to the top left, casting shadows on peripheries, elevating the illusion of form protruding from the surface. This manipulation underlines how the alterations with lighting enhance the clock's dimensionality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the clock maintained a completely flat appearance, or does it now show signs of depth?",
    "explanation": "Image B conveys depth through shadowing and light manipulation around the clock’s edges. The curvature and shadows convey physical thickness and volume, deviating from a flat caricature. These adjustments signal depth, summarized effectively with contour lines and shadows, which portray the clock as a three-dimensional object.",
    "answer": "No"
