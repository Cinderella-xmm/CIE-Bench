    "Question": "Q1: Are there exactly six separate chibi-style illustrations, each depicting one of the specified elements (blouse, lehenga, dupatta, jewelry, bangles, background)?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the visual cues, Image B consists of four chibi-style illustrations, not six. These illustrations show a complete outfit worn by animated characters, featuring the lehenga ensemble with jewelry, and possibly represent a blend of all elements rather than separate depictions of each element such as blouse, lehenga, and others.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do all six magnets exhibit a vibrant, glossy surface with visible reflections or shine?",
    "explanation": "Upon visual inspection, Image B shows four illustrations styled with vibrant colors typical of chibi art representation. While they depict a vivid appearance, no prominent glossy surface or visible reflections are apparent across the images, meaning that not all have glossy surfaces.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do all six magnets have clearly rounded edges instead of sharp corners?",
    "explanation": "Examining the images in Image B reveals that the chibi illustrations have rounded edges, suitable for magnets or collectible items, but since there are only four items instead of six, not all fit the description.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does each of the six magnets accurately depict one of the following: the embellished purple blouse, the intricate lehenga with floral patterns, the red dupatta, the traditional jewelry, the silver bangles, or the ornate background wall pattern?",
    "explanation": "Image B features only four chibi-style representations that collectively illustrate the lehenga outfit with jewelry. Though the chibi depiction is accurate in capturing the detailed elements of the attire, it may blend features within the four complete illustrations rather than having separate depictions for each specified element in six individual images.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all six magnets rendered in a chibi art style, featuring exaggerated proportions such as large heads and simplified facial features?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly displays four items styled in chibi art form, characterized by exaggerated proportions such as large heads and simplified facial features. While they do fit the chibi style, the number of illustrations is incorrect considering the question asks for six instead of four.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the six magnets displayed as individual, standalone items arranged in a way that suggests they are part of a collectible set, rather than a single composite image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi illustrations act as standalone items with each character separately depicted, potentially as part of a set of collectibles. However, as there are only four present, this does not correspond with the query of six separate magnets.",
    "answer": "No"
