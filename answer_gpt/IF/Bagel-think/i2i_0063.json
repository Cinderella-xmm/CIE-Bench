      "question": "Does the edited image feature a horse in the original pose as the protagonist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues prominently display a horse as the central figure, placed front and center, occupying a major portion of the frame. This indicates that the horse is indeed the protagonist in this image. In Image A, a cat is the central focus, and the pose is entirely different from Image B. Thus, the protagonist in Image B has been altered to a horse.",

      "question": "Is the background set in a post-apocalyptic ruined city?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visibly portrays a cityscape that is severely damaged, exhibiting dilapidated buildings and an overall desolate atmosphere which is indicative of a post-apocalyptic setting. This conclusion is drawn from common cinematic depictions of post-apocalyptic environments. In Image A, the background displays household objects and furniture, characteristic of a domestic setting, not a ruined city. Image B's choice of setting contrasts starkly with Image A's domestic backdrop.",

      "question": "Does the title \"LAST RIDE\" appear at the top of the image with a cool-tone filter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'LAST ROER' is featured at the top of the image, not 'LAST RIDE'. The title is accentuated by a cool-tone filter as evidenced by the blue-tinted visuals, possibly suggesting a specific aesthetic style or atmosphere. The title itself differs from the one mentioned in the question, rendering the answer to be 'No'. Image A does not contain such a title or filter, emphasizing the distinct modification present in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, a small label is visible at the bottom right, which typically resembles a film rating label or production house credit seen in promotional materials for movies. This is absent in Image A, which involves a casual home setting. Using world knowledge, promotional images often include such labels to provide additional information or branding.",

      "question": "Has the entire image been filtered with a cool tone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consistently exhibits a bluish tint across its entirety, suggesting the application of a cool-tone filter. This observation is based on the hue and saturation that covers the main subject, background, and overall image composition. Image A does not show any such filtering, as its appearance is more neutral and natural. The cool tone in Image B defines its stylistic editing.",
