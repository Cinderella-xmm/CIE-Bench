      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues clearly show a spherical transparent casing, with a wooden-like base, resembling a snow globe. This enclosure houses the Dovahkiin character along with the snowy scene. Snow globes are typically characterized by a clear dome often filled with water and a snowy interior. Thus, based on these observations and world knowledge about snow globes, the scene is now enclosed within a snow globe.",

      "question": "Is there a stone pedestal and a frosty window visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe resting on a smooth brown surface that appears to be part of the base of the globe, rather than a stone pedestal. In the background, two frosted windows are visible. Although the windows are clearly present, the pedestal does not match the typical appearance of stone, appearing more like the continuing structure of the snow globe's stand.",

      "question": "Does the background outside the frosty window show a snowy mountain range?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, through the frosted window, there are visible peaks resembling mountains, covered in snow, typical of a snowy mountain range. Using world knowledge of how mountain ranges appear, especially in wintry settings, it is reasonable to conclude that the scene outside the window shows a snowy mountain range.",

      "question": "Has the character inside the globe been transformed into a stylized 3D chibi appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character inside Image B depicts a form with exaggerated, smaller proportions characteristic of the chibi art style, which often includes a large head and simplified features to give a cute, playful appearance. This is in contrast to the more realistic human form of the original character. Based on visual cues typical of chibi design, the character indeed appears in a stylized 3D chibi form.",

      "question": "Are there tiny evergreen trees and miniature mountain peaks surrounding the character inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interior of the snow globe in Image B includes small decorative elements like evergreen trees with snow on them and peaks that resemble mountains. These elements surround the character, fitting within the snow globe's wintry theme. This encapsulation inside a snow globe with such miniature scenery aligns with common features found in collectible or decorative snow globes.",
