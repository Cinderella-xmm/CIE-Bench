        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a light brown textured surface that resembles weathered parchment typically seen in historic maps and documents. The visual cues indicating weathering are the discoloration and the rough, uneven edges of the parchment, which are common characteristics used to evoke an aged paper appearance. This transformation into a parchment style background is intended to create a thematic connection to treasure maps.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several pastries, including croissants, a macaron, and a cupcake with frosting, laid out on what appears to be a map. These items are strategically dispersed across the parchment background, serving as landmarks similar to those found on a treasure map. The use of pastries as landmarks combined with the map-like background suggests a thematic design choice meant to convey a pastry-themed map.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a series of dotted lines formed by scattered red berries that lead across the parchment background. These berries trace a path that culminates at a large brown 'X', which visually resembles frosting. This configuration mimics the dotted paths typically found on treasure maps, guiding the viewer from one point to another and eventually to the marked 'X', integrating the pastry theme through the use of frosting imagery.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a compass rose located in the upper left corner, which employs a design style reminiscent of sugar decorations, enhancing the playful, dessert-themed aesthetic of the image.
