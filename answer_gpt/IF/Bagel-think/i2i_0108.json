      "question": "Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the character is depicted in full-body rather than a half-body view. The character is standing upright and the entire figure from head to toe can be seen within the frame. Thus, the depiction is of a full-body figure. This conclusion is based on recognizing the positioning and framing in the image. This contrasts with a typical half-body figure depiction that usually shows only the upper part of the body.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character is not depicted as breaking out from a television screen. Instead, the background features illuminated lines resembling a futuristic or neon-lit environment, but no elements suggest the character is exiting a screen. The visual effect does not imply breaking or emerging from a television screen, typically represented by shattered glass or crossing through a screen's boundary in popular media.",

      "question": "Is the character in a defensive shield-raising pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the character is holding the shield in front of them, as if ready for defense or positioning the shield for use, which indicates a defensive posture. Usually, in superhero contexts, this position is used to protect against approaching threats, thus showcasing readiness for defense.",

      "question": "Does the image simulate an augmented reality display effect through lighting, shadows, and spatial realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts highly stylized lighting effects, specifically neon-like illumination surrounding the character. This creates an augmented reality-like visual quality with sharp lighting contrasts and spatial detailing. The use of these visual effects simulates how augmented reality often enhances 3D representations with vibrant lighting and depth.",

      "question": "Has the character's original appearance and posture been maintained while implementing the new effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the original and edited images, the posture of the character remains consistent with the shield raised in a protective stance. The only added modifications in the edited image are the enhanced lighting and background effects, maintaining the core appearance and posture of the original depiction. Recognition of the unchanged features despite new effects allows this conclusion.",
