      "question": "Is the word \"warm\" placed at the top left corner in large letters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I observe two words in the top portion with bold letters, neither of which spells 'warm.' The word on the left appears to be 'frent' and not 'warm.' My conclusion is derived from analyzing the specific placement and spelling of visible text.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible word 'freedom' located at the bottom right corner in small letters; instead, text appears near the top of the image, partially obscured and cut off. Therefore, based on visual inspection of the specified area, 'freedom' is not present.",

      "question": "Are all original elements, such as the sofa, cushions, rug, plant, and wall art, still present without alteration except for additions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all major elements present in Image A—the sofa, cushions, rug, plant, and wall art—remain unchanged and visible. The only alteration identified is the addition of abstract text. Based on my analysis, the primary components and layout remain intact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a 'home living' atmosphere similar to Image A, featuring a well-lit room with a warm color palette and cozy furniture arrangement. Despite the text addition, the overall ambiance exudes comfort and warmth, a common attribute of home living spaces.",

      "question": "Is the text placement well-balanced so that it complements the rest of the image without disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text placement appears prominent and somewhat disruptive due to its size and positioning over the central artwork. Rather than complementing the decor, it tends to draw attention away, affecting the visual harmony of the setting.",
