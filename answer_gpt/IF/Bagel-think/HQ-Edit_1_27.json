      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible decorative glass dome that surrounds the entire diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene appears to be enclosed within a large glass dome with a visible rim and top. The Eiffel Tower and miniature human figures are clearly encased inside, resembling a diorama or snow globe, commonly used for decorative purposes. This visual cue combined with common knowledge of ornamental glass domes helps to conclude the scene is indeed within a decorative glass dome.",

      "question": "Does the snow in the scene have a delicate, powdery texture, appearing soft and lightly settled rather than dense or icy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow covers the ground evenly and appears smooth and soft, with a gentle distribution without stark or icy textures. This visual presentation, resembling powdered snow often used in small-scale models or dioramas, indicates a delicate and lightly settled appearance, which we associate with powdery snow.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures in the scene noticeably smaller in scale and dressed in vintage-style clothing consistent with early 20th-century Parisian fashion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features human figures that are significantly smaller in scale, as they fit within the confines of a decorative dome alongside the Eiffel Tower. The clothing appears to be long jackets and coats, with hats that suggest vintage styles, commonly seen in historical depictions of early 20th-century fashion. These characteristics support the conclusion that the figures are dressed in vintage-style clothing.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The streetlamps in Image B are proportionately small, fitting within the miniature scene of the Eiffel Tower and miniature figures. The lamps display a luminescent quality indicative of subtle lighting often crafted in miniatures to mimic realistic ambiance and glow, supporting the conclusion that they emit a soft, subtle glow.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, diminutive trees are visible, appearing leafless but intricately crafted with branches. These branches are covered by a slight dusting of snow, more ornamental than heavy. The visual characteristics are akin to miniature models where decorative light snow enhances realism without overwhelming detail.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

These paths wind gracefully through the scene, adding depth and detail consistent with miniature landscapes depicting urban environments.",
