      "question": "Has the woman been transformed into a stone carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual presentation of the woman suggests she has been transformed into a stone carving due to her uniform stone-like texture and lack of features typical in a living human, such as varied skin tones and natural movements. This transformation gives a sense of being sculpted from the same material as the background.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water in the pool appears as textured patterns more reminiscent of a carved surface rather than natural flowing water. The lines are regular and spaced as one might see in artistic stonework rather than the random patterns of water.",
