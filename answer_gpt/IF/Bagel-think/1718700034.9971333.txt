    "Question": "Q1: Are the wings replaced with large, angular crystal shards in shades of opal and white?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are depicted as having an angular, crystalline structure with shades of opal and white. These visual cues suggest the wings are designed to represent large crystals rather than the soft, feathered wings observed in common depictions of angelic imagery. The change in shape and texture supports the conclusion that the wings have been replaced by large, angular crystal shards.",

    "Question": "Q5: Has the figureâ€™s facial expression, posture, and positioning remained unchanged from the original image?",
    "explanation": "Considering the posture and positioning from what is visible in both images, there seems to be no significant alteration, as the figure maintains a similar stance. With no specific changes noted in the posture and positioning, it can be concluded that they remain unchanged. Since facial expression cannot be assessed due to the blurred face, posture and positioning are the basis for this judgment.",
