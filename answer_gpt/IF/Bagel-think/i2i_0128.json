      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keyboard is surrounded by a glow of blue and purple hues, indicating that the light source is emitting these colors.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands, particularly the fingertips, appear to be illuminated by the same blue and purple lighting that affects the rest of the image. While not glowing in a luminous way by themselves, they do reflect the ambient neon light, creating a soft glow effect. This visual cue, combined with world knowledge about reflective surfaces, suggests a soft glow.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall lighting in Image B is consistent with a cyberpunk style, as it uses strong neon lights, which are blue and purple, effectively highlighting the hands and the keyboard. This type of dramatic, colored lighting is typical in cyberpunk visuals and complements the central glowing elements, enhancing the futuristic and technological theme.",
