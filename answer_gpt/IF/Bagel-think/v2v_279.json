      "question": "Has the bird been converted into a 3D chibi-style model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird exhibits features typical of 3D chibi-style models, including exaggerated eyes and rounded, simplified shapes. This is consistent with the general characteristics of chibi art, which emphasizes cuteness with simplified details. Image A shows the bird in a more realistic, painted style common in traditional artwork. The conversion in Image B highlights a shift towards a more cartoonish appearance, fulfilling the chibi criteria.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lemur features a more cartoon-like appearance with simplified forms and an emphasis on cuteness, aligning with 3D chibi style conventions. These modifications differ from its depiction in Image A, where the lemur looks more realistic and detailed, as typical of traditional paintings.",

      "question": "Have the other characters in the scene been converted into 3D chibi-style models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the human characters with smoother, more simplified features and slightly exaggerated proportions typical of 3D chibi-style transformations, emphasizing a more playful and stylized aesthetic. In contrast, Image A shows these characters with realistic proportions and details in line with classic portraiture.",

      "question": "Are the outfits and accessories of the characters preserved after being converted into 3D chibi-style models?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the transition to a 3D chibi style in Image B, the characters' outfits and accessories, such as the shirt, coat, and the pocket watch, are retained and recognizable, although depicted in a more simplified form. This maintains continuity in character representation between the two images, despite stylistic changes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positions of the characters, bird, and lemur in Image B maintain the same relative placements and orientation as in Image A. This consistency in layout ensures that, despite the stylistic changes to chibi form, the overall composition of the scene remains unchanged between the two images.",
