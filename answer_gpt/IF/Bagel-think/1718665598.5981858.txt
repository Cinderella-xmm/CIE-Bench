    "Question": "Q1: Are the elements of the scene (road, sky, trees, poles) fragmented into geometric shapes such as polygons, rectangles, and triangles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements resemble geometric shapes such as polygons, rectangles, and triangles, seen in the overall angular and fragmented appearance. The Image B's style is characterized by sharp edges creating a mosaic or cubist effect, which strongly indicates the use of these geometric shapes. This contrasts with typical natural forms, which are usually more rounded and irregular.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the road composed of angular, non-smooth sections instead of a smooth, curving surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the road is depicted with angular transitions and lacks a smooth, continuous curve typically found in natural road surfaces. The use of straight lines and sharp angles creates a segmented appearance, characteristic of geometric abstraction, indicating the road is composed of angular sections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the clouds represented as overlapping quadrilateral or polygonal shapes rather than soft, natural cloud formations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are depicted using overlapping geometric shapes like quadrilaterals and polygons, deviating from organic cloud formations. This angular representation conveys a stylized interpretation, aligning with abstract art styles, rather than the softer, more amorphous shapes typical of natural clouds.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the telegraph poles rendered in a stylized, geometric form using angular lines and shapes rather than realistic proportions and textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the telegraph poles are depicted using simple, angular lines without texture details, giving them a stylized and geometric appearance. This contrasts with realistic portrayals that typically include a sense of proportion and texture, thus supporting the notion that an abstract, non-realistic rendering approach was applied to the telegraph poles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the trees depicted as abstract triangular shapes rather than natural, rounded tree canopies?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows trees represented in polygonal forms, particularly triangles, deviating from the rounded and complex canopies of natural trees. This approach reflects a stylized abstraction, where natural elements are transformed into simple geometric forms to emphasize artistic style over realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the image use only muted greens, grays, and deep yellows, avoiding bright or saturated colors?",
    "explanation": "Image B predominantly features muted tones, including greens, grays, and deep yellows, without the presence of bright or saturated colors. This palette supports a subdued aesthetic, emphasizing geometric abstraction over realistic vibrancy, which would otherwise include a wider range of natural colors.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is there a clear sense of depth and perspective in the scene, with the road leading toward a distant horizon despite the geometric abstraction?",
    "explanation": "Image B maintains a sense of depth and perspective through the geometric shapes, as the arrangement of angular elements suggests a road receding into the distance. This visual structure mirrors traditional perspective techniques, even with abstract and fragmented rendering, conveying depth and spatial orientation effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
