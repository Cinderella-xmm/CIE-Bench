    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure rendered as a bronze sculpture with a metallic surface finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire figure appears to be transformed into a bronze sculpture by giving it a metallic sheen that is typical of bronze artworks. The surface finish is consistent across the body, indicating a deliberate choice to represent the figure as a bronze sculpture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs visibly elongated compared to natural human proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the figure are elongated compared to typical human proportions, suggesting a stylistic choice to exaggerate the form for artistic effect. This elongation contributes to the graceful and fluid appearance of the figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the legs form smooth, curved shapes that suggest dynamic movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B appear to curve smoothly and dynamically. This curvature suggests motion and grace, often seen in sculpture work where movement is implied through the form of the figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have all floral elements been replaced with geometric patterns consistent with Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral elements are preserved, although rendered with a bronze finish. They do not appear to be transformed into geometric patterns typical of Art Deco design. Instead, the flower shape and arrangement seem consistent with the original depiction, albeit in a new color scheme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image rendered in metallic tones while preserving the original color scheme (teal, red, pink)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B utilizes a metallic bronze tone for the figure, the background and overall color scheme do not maintain the original colors of teal, red, and pink. Instead, the metallic tone predominates, altering the imagery significantly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background a solid, uniform turquoise color matching the overall aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a solid turquoise color that harmonizes with the statue-like rendering of the figure, maintaining consistency in the overall aesthetic of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the adornments on the figure composed of symmetrical, angular, or repetitive geometric motifs typical of Art Deco style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The adornments in Image B retain the floral look rather than transforming into typical Art Deco geometric patterns. The bronze stylization enhances the finish but does not alter the floral elements into symmetrical, angular motifs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
