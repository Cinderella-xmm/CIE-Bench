      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a visible curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a scene where the ship and seagulls are enclosed within a clearly visible curved glass dome. This is evident from the spherical shape of the glass around the objects, which is typical of snow globes. Commonly, such a design is used to present miniature diorama scenes, offering a clear boundary and protection for the items inside.",

      "question": "Are the sails depicted with visible creases, layered edges, and shadows consistent with a papercraft material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails of the ship have visible creases and layered edges that resemble paper or thin fabric. This appearance can be attributed to how they are crafted to resemble miniatures often seen in models or dioramas, where the detailing could mimic papercraft. These signs include obvious folds and a texture that suggests a lightweight material typical of papercraft designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a translucent, shimmering blue resin layer beneath the ship that mimics ocean waves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a translucent blue layer beneath the ship, shaped to resemble waves. This layer has a textured ripple effect typical of resin used in miniature models to imitate water. The color and form of this blue substance position it as a static representation of ocean waves, using materials like resin for its clarity and shine.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls suspended by fine, barely visible wires, giving them a static yet dynamic floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seagulls within the glass dome do not appear to be physically supported by visible wires, which is a common approach in dioramas to create the illusion of flight. However, without visible wires, the illusion of suspension might be achieved through positioning or other support invisible in the photo. The static yet dynamic appearance suggests that they might be supported in such a way, but the visibility of wires isn't confirmed.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural details such as masts, rigging, and hull design, now presented in miniature scale within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship preserves its key structural elements—masts, rigging, and hull—but scaled down to fit within the glass dome. This features the typical approach in miniatures where the original design is meticulously reduced. The hull retains detailed characteristics that align with what would be found on a larger ship, and the rigging is depicted in a simplified but recognizable form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer exhibit shimmering surface textures and light reflections that simulate flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue resin layer in Image B presents textures and light reflections that imitate the dynamic surface of water. Resin’s reflective properties are commonly used in model-making to create the illusion of movement or flow in water items, allowing them to appear lively even in a static form. Its shimmer and contour suggest fluid dynamics despite being a frozen depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the curved glass dome visibly present with clear boundaries and possible light refraction effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly displays a curved glass dome, enclosing the scene with visible boundaries. The curve of the glass is obvious, along with potential light effects such as refraction and reflection, contributing to the visual complexity of the scene. These effects are typical of glass domes, enhancing the perception of depth and dimensionality.",
