      "question": "Does the edited image combine the front and right-side views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's face and body are oriented towards the camera in a frontal view. The head slightly turns to the left, but this does not create a right-side view. In visual representation, combining views typically means elements from two different perspectives are visibly incorporated into one image. Here, only the frontal view is evident, while the right side remains unseen, suggesting no combination of views occurs.",

      "question": "Are the cat's facial features clearly visible in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's facial features, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and whiskers, are in sharp focus and clearly distinguishable. The lighting and clarity put emphasis on these details, allowing for a clear view of the facial features. This suggests that the elements contributing to clarity have been well-preserved or enhanced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cat's body structure properly showcased in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is partially visible with a clear view of the front paws and part of the torso with its fur texture emphasized. However, the rest of the body, particularly the hindquarters and tail, are not centrally focused, resulting in a less complete showcase of the entire body structure. However, the positional angle allows fine observation of the cat's relaxed body posture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the original color, size, and position of the cat been preserved in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat maintains its creamy white color, consistent size, and relaxed position on the cushion as seen in Image A. The environmental factors such as background blur and lighting maintain consistency, allowing for the preservation of the original characteristics such as color and positing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition free from distortion and inconsistency in integrating both views of the cat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question implies that two views are combined, yet Image B reflects a single cohesive frontal perspective. Thus, there are no inconsistencies or distortions arising from merging views. The composition appears balanced and consistent. Since no integration of multiple perspectives occurs, the composition maintains its visual integrity.",
