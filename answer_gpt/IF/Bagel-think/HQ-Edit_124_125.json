      "question": "Is the image formatted as part of a multi-card art print collection, such as a panorama card within a curated set?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual layout resembles a multi-card collection, visible as a grouping of three panels side by side, each containing a similar style of art of a figure in various poses. This suggests a curated set, as each panel seems to be a variant position of the same figure, reinforcing the concept of a panorama card or multi-card art print. Hence, the appearance of these cards grouped and uniformly styled implies a collection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a cartoonized style with simplified features and smooth lines, rather than photorealistic detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is illustrated with simplified features and smooth lines, a hallmark of cartoon or animated nature, rather than intricate detailing that imitates real-life textures or expressions. This stylistic choice delivers a more stylized and less realistic representation typical of cartoon art.",

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are prominently filled with soft, calming earth tones; these include muted greens in the clothing and earthy tones in the background sunset, as well as the tans of the sand, and yellows of the sunlight.

      "question": "Are the figureâ€™s limbs and body posture elongated and gracefully exaggerated beyond natural proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure's body in Image B is accomplished through art that stylistically extends and exaggerates the limbs and posture, matching elongated and fluid lines that transcend natural human proportions. Such depiction gives an appearance of grace and elegance that fits a stylized rather than realistic portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the beach elements (such as waves, sand, and rocks) rendered in a stylized, artistic manner rather than photorealistic detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's representation of the beach with its waves, sand, and rocks lacks intricate realistic textures, instead opting for smooth, stylized depictions that echo the cartoon-like style. The visual approach emphasizes aesthetics with artistic impression instead of aiming for lifelike accuracy.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B features a relaxed facial expression most commonly exhibited in serene or meditative states, implied by simplified features and gently closed or softly attentive eyes. This portrayal conveys tranquility which suits the overall mood of calm flowing through the serene environmental depiction.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are text elements located at the bottom of each card. The text looks like it is intended to be descriptive or perhaps instructional, but the content appears as nonsensical words rather than recognized language. Despite the presence of text potentially suggesting tips or notes, it doesn't provide clearly readable or related information.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B is structured in a way that mimics a textured photo album cover with distinct borders and the illusion of texture. This appearance is created by the card-like presentation and side-binding, resembling a physical object with tangible surface, simulating a photo album or collection cover.",
