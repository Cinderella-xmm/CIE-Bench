    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the totem pole now presented as a miniature scene within a confined space, suggesting a scaled-down 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the totem pole is clearly placed within a glass dome, surrounded by small plants, suggesting it is part of a miniature or scaled-down scene. This presentation implies a confined space and a 3D environment, which differs from Image A, where the totem pole is standalone and life-sized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the totem pole enclosed within a transparent cylindrical glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the totem pole within a transparent cylindrical glass dome, which confines the totem pole. This dome serves as a protective and decorative structure, different from Image A where the totem pole is not enclosed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there tiny ferns and moss visible at the base of the totem pole inside the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surrounding the base of the totem pole are elements resembling small ferns and moss, which are indicative of a created natural microenvironment. These elements are absent in Image A, where the pole is solitary.",

      "question": "Is there a butterfly perched on the top of the totem pole?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a butterfly visible within the dome, although it is not precisely perched on top of the totem pole but rather adjacent to it. This choice of placement enhances the lifelike quality of the setting.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the image use an earthy color palette dominated by natural browns and greens, with visible wood texture and green plant accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features natural browns and greens typical of an earthy palette. The totem pole retains its wood texture, while the added plants inside the dome provide green accents. This color scheme creates a harmonious natural look, which matches the context provided.",
