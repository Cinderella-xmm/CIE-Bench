      "question": "Does the bottle appear as a transparent crystal vessel with visible swirling ocean wave patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle is depicted as having a transparent appearance with intricate blue wave patterns that seem to move, evoking the imagery of ocean waves. The transparency gives the impression of a crystal vessel. This is a significant departure from typical whisky bottle designs that don't feature such elaborate art-inspired designs, supporting the interpretation of a stylized crystal vessel.",

      "question": "Is the label replaced with intricate golden maritime symbols instead of the original text and design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features designs that incorporate golden maritime symbols prominently on the bottle, replacing the traditional text-heavy label seen in conventional designs like those in Image A. This usage of intricate maritime motifs, including a compass element, suggests that the label is indeed replaced with ornamentation rather than text.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the packaging been transformed into a parchment-like scroll with aged texture and scroll-like edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the packaging does not appear as a parchment scroll. Although the background around the depicted bottle and box resembles an aged texture similar to parchment, the packaging itself does not demonstrate scroll-like edges as would be characteristic of a traditional parchment scroll. The packaging retains its cylindrical shape consistent with a whisky box.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the top of the packaging feature a compass rose with metallic-looking directional points set against a parchment background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a design with compass roses that include directional points and a maritime theme, highlighted against an aged parchment-like background. This depiction at the top of the packaging is indeed reminiscent of a compass rose with metallic aesthetics, aligning with maritime navigation symbols.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bottle and packaging exhibit ethereal qualities such as glowing edges, light refraction, or a mystical aura consistent with an elixir vessel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle design suggests ethereal qualities with elements like light refraction, and glowing highlights around the wave patterns and compass symbols, giving it a mystical, otherworldly aura. These elements combined simulate the appearance and feel symbolic of an elixir vessel, which doesn't align with typical whisky bottle designs.",
