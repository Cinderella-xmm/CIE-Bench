        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, parts of the building have been altered to include mechanical elements. Specifically, there are arm-like extensions with spiral, gear-like features, suggesting mechanical limbs. This gives the appearance that the building is part of a larger mechanical structure, resembling a golem with articulated limbs.",
