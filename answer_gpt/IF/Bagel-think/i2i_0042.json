        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted with exaggerated proportions typical of chibi figures, such as a larger head in proportion to the body and more stylized features, which is characteristic of chibi-style collectible figures. These visual cues combined with the common characteristics of chibi figures lead to the conclusion that the person has been transformed into such a figure.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presentation resembles a three-dimensional collectible figure rather than a flat acrylic standee character sheet. The presence of features such as a base with text and the sculpted form of the chibi figure resemble common characteristics of figures rather than flat standees.",
