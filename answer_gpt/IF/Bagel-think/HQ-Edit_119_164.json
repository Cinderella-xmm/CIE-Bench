      "question": "Does the elephant’s skin feature a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars, nebulae, and cosmic swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis shows that the elephant's skin, particularly on the face and trunk, has a galaxy-patterned texture with visible stars and a nebula-like appearance. The cosmic swirls and glowing elements give it an ethereal, space-like quality. This conclusion is reached by observing the added blue cosmic design superimposed on the elephant's skin.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant’s tusks exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance with glowing, cloud-like textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tusks of the elephant do not exhibit a shimmering, nebula-like appearance. They appear unchanged from the natural look of tusks, lacking any cloud-like textures or glowing effects that the question describes. The modifications are focused on the ears and the facial area.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the elephant’s ears replaced with vast, sail-like structures that reflect starry constellations and have a celestial appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the elephant's ears have been artistically altered to feature planets, making them appear otherworldly and cosmic. However, they are not replaced with sail-like structures, nor do they directly reflect starry constellations. The focus of the edit is the incorporation of planets rather than star-filled sails.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the elephant’s trunk emit a visible, swirling cosmic mist composed of glowing particles or nebula-like vapor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The imagery of Image B focuses on galaxy-themed alterations mainly on the face and ears, but there is no visible cosmic mist or nebula-like vapor emanating from the elephant's trunk. The edits are more about adding a cosmic texture to the surface than emitting particles from the trunk.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there radiant, glowing planetary rings encircling the elephant’s legs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, there are no visible planetary rings or any glowing structures around the elephant's legs. The visual modifications are concentrated on the head and ears, not affecting the elephant's lower body or legs in this manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modifications in Image B do not extend to the feet of the elephant. There are no luminescent star patterns or glowing effects noted on the feet, as the cosmic alterations remain focused on the upper parts of the elephant's body.",
