      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's torso is depicted with smooth, artificial contours reminiscent of a stylized figurine, adding to a sense of enhanced proportions and artificiality that aligns with figurines often seen in collectibles. This transformation is evident, contrasting with the realistic human proportions seen in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the base exhibit a subtle reflection consistent with polished metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no base depicted in Image B, there cannot be any reflection or material quality characteristics such as polished metal, maintaining the focus solely on the figurine itself.",
