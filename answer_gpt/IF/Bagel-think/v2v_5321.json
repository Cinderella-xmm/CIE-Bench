      "question": "Does the image exhibit a hand-sculpted claymation style with visible textures and a three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style gives the appearance of a hand-crafted sculpture with visible textures that emulate a hand-sculpted look. The characters and the surroundings have a somewhat exaggerated, cartoonish detail that is common in claymation, displaying a three-dimensional tactile effect. The details, such as the stripes and the overall character, seem molded rather than realistically depicted, indicating a claymation style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes on the character's costume clearly defined and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the character's costume are thick and prominent, synonymous with the characteristics of claymation where features are often enhanced for emphasis. The lines appear to be part of the sculpted detail rather than printed or sewn fabric, which is typical for clay figures and aids in establishing the style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the character's beret clearly visible and emphasized in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beret is distinctly visible, sitting atop the character's head with exaggerated definition that fits the embellished nature of claymation objects. The shape and presence align with the handcrafted, stylized approach seen in the rest of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background maintain the European rooftop setting, with architectural details adapted to the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B retains the European rooftop scene, featuring structured and simplified architectural elements. These details are adapted into the claymation style through exaggeration and a softer focus, imparting a hand-sculpted look to the buildings and sky.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire image, including the character and the background, consistently rendered in the hand-sculpted claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the character and the background exhibit a unified claymation style. The visible textures, three-dimensional quality, and stylized details across the entire image reflect a consistent approach to rendering in this particular aesthetic, akin to hand-molded figures and landscapes.",
