      "question": "Is the shoe now rendered as a carved wooden sculpture rather than a fabric and rubber athletic shoe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe exhibits characteristics that resemble a carved wooden sculpture. The texture and color are consistent with wood, showing a grain pattern typical of wood materials, and the entire structure of the shoe is shaped to appear as if carved from a single block of wood. This artistic treatment transforms the appearance from that of a typical athletic shoe made from fabric and rubber into something resembling sculpture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the panel shapes, lace paths, and branding details represented with deep grooves and visible wood grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the shoe with markings that mimic the details found in a real shoe, such as panels and lace paths, using deep grooves, which indicate carving techniques. The wood grain pattern across these surfaces confirms the material as wood and enhances the visual effect of depth and texture typical of carved objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sculpture use a combination of dark and light wood tones to represent the original black and gray coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses various shades of wood tones, including both darker and lighter elements, to simulate the original colors of the shoe. This color variation aids in identifying different parts and accents on the shoe, similar to how fabric and rubber components would be highlighted by color differences in a non-wooden shoe.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden shoe displayed on a minimalist gallery shelf with a clean, uncluttered design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe is positioned on a simple, clean shelf that lacks any additional clutter or design distractions. This presentation style is characteristic of gallery displays meant to emphasize the artwork, keeping focus on the carved shoe itself.",

      "question": "Is the presentation of the shoe designed to emphasize its detailed carving and texture, suggesting an artistic display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B highlights not only the carved details of the shoe but also emphasizes the wood texture, which together suggest an artistic presentation. The minimalist shelf and focus on the sculpture's details are indicative of a display meant to showcase craftsmanship rather than functionality.",
