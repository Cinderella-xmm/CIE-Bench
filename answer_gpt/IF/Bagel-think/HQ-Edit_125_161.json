    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the spiral staircase been fully replaced by a serpent-shaped form that follows the same helical path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual observation shows a serpent occupying the path of the original spiral staircase, effectively replacing it by twisting along the same upwardly spiral path. This suggests that the staircase structure is no longer visible and has been fully replaced by the serpent structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body feature detailed lattice-like scales across its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B is depicted with a pattern that resembles scales—a lattice-like design commonly associated with dragon scales. This indicates the presence of detailed scales across the surface of the serpent's body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s body extended downward in a way that visually replicates the step-like descent of the original staircase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the serpent follows the basic helical path of the original staircase, its body does not replicate the distinct horizontal step-like features of a staircase; instead, it exhibits a more fluid, curved form typical of a snake or dragon. Therefore, the extension does not replicate a step-like descent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ornate, filigree-like patterns present on the serpent’s body, matching the style of the original railing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a serpent without intricate filigree-like decorations on its body. The serpent instead displays scale patterns typical of reptilian skin rather than the ornate designs found in railing work in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the banister been replaced with a series of delicate, translucent fins along the serpent’s side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B shows that serpentine crests or fins resembling delicate structures are present along the body, suggesting they replace the ornamental banister, albeit in a sleek, non-translucent form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a serpent’s head positioned at the uppermost point of the spiral, featuring two distinct luminescent gem-like eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B is indeed seen with its head towards the topmost part of the spiral, and it possesses a pair of bright, gem-like eyes that appear luminescent. This feature is prominent and visually striking.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the serpent’s body display a marble-like texture with visible veining and polished surface characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the serpent in Image B appears more matte with textured scales rather than resembling a polished, veined marble texture. The texture is consistent with reptilian skin rather than stone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
