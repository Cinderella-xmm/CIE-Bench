    "Question": "Q1: Are the surfers replaced with pandas holding surfboards?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the heads of the people in the image have been replaced with panda heads, making them appear as humans with panda heads rather than full pandas. This alteration gives the illusion that the subjects are pandas, but it is not a full transformation. Therefore, they are not completely replaced by pandas.",
