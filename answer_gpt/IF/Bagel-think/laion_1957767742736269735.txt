    "Question": "Q1: Is the tank's body composed entirely of olive and dark green LEGO bricks, showing a blocky, modular construction consistent with LEGO building style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tank appears to be constructed entirely out of LEGO bricks, characterized by a blocky appearance. The color palette includes sky blue and multiple colors like red, yellow, and green, which is diverse compared to typical olive and dark green colors. This transformation gives the tank a stylized and whimsical look. By comparison, Image A's tank is not made of LEGO bricks and maintains its realistic military design in traditional colors. Thus, the tank in Image B is not composed purely of olive and dark green LEGO bricks.",
