      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the new background environment in Image B, the vase and sunflowers remain the central object due to their positioning, size, and vibrant colors, which draw visual attention directly to them amidst the more subdued kitchen backdrop.",
