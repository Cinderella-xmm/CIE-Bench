      "question": "Has the central structure been replaced with a digital billboard featuring luminous panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structure prominently features various luminous panels emitting a bright teal glow, indicative of digital billboard components. This contrasts with Image A, where the structure is composed of solid, concrete-like materials without illumination. The analysis suggests that these luminous elements have replaced the original materials to create a digital billboard effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible dynamic neon animations on the digital billboard surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bright teal glowing elements with prominent digital patterns which resemble static light displays rather than any animated neon effects. Since these panels exhibit a consistent glow pattern and do not depict motion, it suggests that while they are luminous, they do not contain dynamic neon animations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the natural overgrowth been replaced with synthetic, glowing foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lower sections of the structure feature bright teal-like glowing elements that mimic overgrowth but are not naturally occurring plants, unlike Image A which shows actual foliage. These glowing elements resemble synthetic constructs, indicating a shift from natural to artificial features in the setting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the original architectural angles and structural geometry preserved in the transformed structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the structural composition seen in Image A, including the distinct geometric angles and overall shape of the central structure. The visual architecture appears unchanged despite the digital billboard transformation, maintaining consistency in the geometry.",

      "question": "Do the surrounding buildings feature metallic facades and visible augmented reality elements such as holograms or digital overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding buildings maintain the same non-metallic, worn-down appearance seen in Image A, characterized by concrete and traditional building materials. There are no visible augmented reality elements like holograms or digital overlays present in the edited image.",
