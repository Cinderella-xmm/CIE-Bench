        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge features a tassel hanging from it, but the badge itself is not made of tassel material. Instead, the tassel is an attachment, whereas the badge appears to be a drawn or illustrated representation, likely on a hard badge surface. The tassel material refers to the specific fringed part hanging from the bottom, consistent with what is traditionally known as a tassel.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation shows a badge that is circular in shape.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, part of the image clearly depicts a hand holding the circular badge. The hand is drawn in an animated style holding the badge with its fingers, suggesting a presentation or holding act typical of how one might show or offer a badge to someone.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design inside the badge in Image B is colorful and shows simplified forms of domed structures, resembling the same vibrant style and colorful domes, akin to Saint Basil's Cathedral. Combining this visual information with common knowledge about such vibrant structures, it is clear the badge features a similar lively design, although in a stylized manner.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic style of the badge indicates bold outlines and simplified features, which are characteristics associated with anime or cartoon styles. Additionally, the whole depiction, including the hand presentation, aligns more with an illustrative or anime-inspired aesthetic rather than realistic rendering, supporting the conclusion of anime style.",
