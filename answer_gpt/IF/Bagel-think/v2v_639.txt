    "Question": "Q1: Is the person and giraffe depicted in a classic LEGO minifigure style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person and giraffe are depicted with simplified, blocky forms typical of LEGO figures. The person exhibits the characteristic cylindrical hands and legs seen in LEGO minifigures, and the giraffe has a stylized, simplified appearance aligning with LEGO design aesthetics. This style contrasts with more realistic representations of figures in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the giraffe feature matching tones and patterns inspired by the person's outfit?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe retains its natural coloration and patterning consistent with a real giraffe, whereas the person is dressed in a uniform of blue shades. No matching tones or outfit-inspired patterns are evident in the giraffe's design. Image A features a realistic giraffe without any influence from the person's attire.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the composition enclosed within a transparent glass cube?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the entire composition enclosed within a transparent structure resembling a display case or cube. The visual cues such as reflections and boundaries clearly indicate a cube enclosing the figures, a detail absent in the open, natural setting of Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is there a matte black base with silver accents and an engraved nameplate reading 'Giraffa Elegans'?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a base with a matte black finish, and silver accents can be seen along its edges. The nameplate is engraved and clearly reads 'GIRAFA FOLOLO' instead of the suggested name 'Giraffa Elegans'. Therefore, the comparison reveals a discrepancy in the nameplate text between expectation and reality.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the background feature a gradient transitioning from dark to light?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B displays a gradient, transitioning smoothly from darker tones at the top to lighter tones towards the bottom. This differs from Image A, which features a natural landscape background with consistent greenery rather than a gradient effect.",
