      "question": "Are all the spines on the cactus replaced with shimmering crystal shards?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an examination shows the presence of shimmering crystal shards found between the standard cactus spines, but not replacing them completely. This visual information suggests that while crystals have been added, the original spines remain intact. From this observation, we can conclude that not all spines are replaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there luminous glyphs visible on the surface of the cactus?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the cactus features various decorative elements, such as crystal-like structures, but there is no indication of glyphs, which are typically symbolic characters or markings. Therefore, based on visual evidence, no luminous glyphs are present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the terracotta pot been transformed into a sandstone pedestal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the base structure of the cactus is made of stone with a stacked and rugged texture, similar to sandstone. When comparing to Image A, the original pot was terracotta and smooth. This change in texture and material appearance fits the transformation from terracotta to a sandstone-like pedestal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inspection of Image B reveals two distinct eye-like features embedded within the cactus, having a shiny, amber-like appearance. These features strongly resemble eyes due to their color and location, fitting the description given.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clearly visible vine tendrils with small flowers around the stone pedestal. This addition of floral elements enhances the aesthetic and meets the description provided in the question.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modifications in Image B, such as the addition of crystal shards, eye-like amber features, and flowered vines, give the cactus a magical and animated appearance. These elements collectively create the impression of an enchanted guardian through mystical adornments and implied sentient traits.",
