      "question": "Is the clock's frame made of translucent crystal instead of wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame of the clock is visually distinct with a crystalline appearance. The frame reflects light and has a smooth, shiny, and clear surface, characteristics typical of crystal rather than wood. This suggests the use of translucent crystal material. Comparing this to Image A, where the frame is richly wooden with carved details and no transparency, further confirms this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ornamental details and frame of the clock crafted from frosted crystal rather than carved wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental details and the frame appear to have a frosted-like quality, exhibiting a glass-like translucency. This appearance indicates the use of frosted crystal, contrasting with Image A's intricately carved wooden decorations that have a matte and solid appearance typical of wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock face made of smooth, clear crystal with etched Roman numerals instead of a wooden face with painted numerals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clock face that is smooth, reflecting light with a clear surface, suggestive of crystal, and the Roman numerals appear to be etched into the surface. This is different from Image A, where the numerals are painted onto a wooden face that lacks translucency or reflective qualities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the pendulum been replaced with a faceted crystal ornament instead of a solid wooden disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pendulum in Image B is represented by a faceted crystal ornament, which shows complex angles and reflections indicative of a crystal structure. This contrasts with Image A's pendulum, which is a solid wooden disc, without any reflective or intricate faceting characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the clock mounted on a minimalist white marble wall with visible natural veining?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that could be perceived as marble due to its smooth white surface. However, upon closer inspection, there are no visible natural veins or patterns, which are typical indicators of marble. Image A shows a textured wall with imperfections and paint rather than marble, allowing us to conclude that both walls are not definitively marble.",
