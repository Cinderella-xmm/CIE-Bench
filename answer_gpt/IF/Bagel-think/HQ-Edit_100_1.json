    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the scene enclosed within a visible wooden shadow box frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual analysis of Image B, the scene is clearly enclosed within a wooden frame. This is evident from the structure surrounding the scene that resembles a shadow box with a distinct frame often used for displaying dioramas or small art installations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the tree been scaled down in size and rendered with enhanced 3D surface texture (e.g., visible bark details, depth, shading)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree appears to be a scaled-down miniature version as part of a diorama encased within a shadow box. It has a noticeably enhanced 3D surface texture, with visible details on the bark and shading that give it a tangible depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, distinct patches of multi-colored flowers (e.g., pink, yellow, blue, red) beneath the tree?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct, colorful patches of flowers on the ground beneath the tree, with visible colors such as pink, yellow, blue, and red. These flowers appear as distinct and separate clusters, contributing to the overall vibrant scenery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background consist of multiple layered painted surfaces that create a sense of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears flat and painted with a single layer, consisting mainly of sky and clouds. It lacks the multiple layered surfaces that would create depth, as it is part of a diorama inside a shadow box and not a realistic landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, detailed cloud shapes visibly suspended by thin wires above or within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows small, crafted cloud shapes that are suspended by thin wires, giving the appearance of hanging within the scene. This setup is typical within dioramas to give an illusion of floating clouds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the image include surreal or stylized elements (e.g., floating clouds, soft glow, pastel hues) that contribute to a whimsical and dreamlike atmosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B includes stylized elements such as miniature clouds suspended by wires, an enclosed frame giving a sense of containment and artistry, and vibrant, saturated colors. These elements create a whimsical, almost toy-like and dreamlike atmosphere, different from natural realism.",
