      "question": "Does the motorcycle and truck appear in a simplified, cartoon-like version with a cute aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the motorcycle and the truck are depicted with simplified lines and shapes characteristic of cartoon-like illustrations. The details are minimal, and the design focuses on clear outlines and vibrant colors, which give it a cute aesthetic. This simplification is typical of cartoon versions where realistic features are reduced in favor of stylized representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the key features—the red sport motorcycle, the rider dressed in black gear, and the blue vintage truck—retained in the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme remains unchanged with a red sport motorcycle and a blue vintage truck, as seen in the original image. The rider is dressed in black gear. These details are essential elements that are retained even in a simplified, cartoon rendition to ensure recognizability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vehicles and rider include playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows characteristics typical of cartoon art, where proportions may be exaggerated, such as larger helmets and simplified shapes that add a playful touch. This is indicative of cartoon styling which often plays with dimensions to create expressive and whimsical features not present in realistic depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a thick white outline around the sticker design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly demonstrates a thick white outline encircling the cartoon objects and figures, a stylistic choice often used to define and separate sticker designs visually from any surface they are applied to. This bold outlining enhances the image's contrast and visibility.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a solid flat color circular base with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it for a dynamic effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show a solid flat color circular base beneath the illustrations. Instead, the elements appear independently enclosed within the white outline, suggesting no additional background layer extends from beneath them for dynamic effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the sticker transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the design elements of Image B, the area outside the cartoon illustration is rendered as empty space enclosed by a white outline, implying a transparent background for sticker application purposes where no additional background coloration is displayed.",
