      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows various graphic design elements such as stylized text 'HABTINE SITQ', a chef hat, and flames, which are commonly found in posters. Its circular and colorful design suggests it has been formatted as a logo or emblem, possibly for promotional or branding purposes, akin to a poster format.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the text 'HABTINE SITQ' is prominently displayed. However, 'Master Chef' is not visible anywhere in the image. Based on this visual information and the typical expectancies for titles, the specific text 'Master Chef' is absent.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no text that reads 'Final Round'. The texts present are 'HABTINE SITQ' and 'TEVE'. Given these observations, 'Final Round' is neither present nor functioning as a subtitle.",
