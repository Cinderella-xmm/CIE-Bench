    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the overall lines and contours of the image now clear and well-defined?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has been transformed into a stylized line drawing. The lines and contours are clear and well-defined, emphasizing shapes and silhouettes without textural details, typical of illustrations or sketches. The absence of gradients and textures helps in creating clear lines that define the contours distinctly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the original textures been replaced with soft gradient blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed textures from Image A such as the fabric texture of clothes and the cobblestones are replaced with clean lines and flat colors without gradients or textural details. This transition is indicative of an illustration style that uses lines and shapes rather than gradient blocks.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the image now exhibit characteristics of a high-end commercial illustration (e.g., refined and sophisticated appearance)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a line drawing, reflects simplicity and elegance through clear shapes and structured composition. Although this style is not inherently sophisticated or refined as seen in high-end commercial illustrations that often employ gradient colors and more detailed artistic techniques, it does offer clarity and minimalism in presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges and boundaries between elements in the image now sharply defined and crisp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is composed of sharp lines and clear, well-defined boundaries between different elements such as the bags, mannequins, and women. This style avoids ambiguities and blends that can occur in colored photographs, presenting a stark separation between areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do areas previously filled with detailed textures now feature smooth, soft gradients instead?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, detailed textures present in Image A have been removed, but they have not been replaced with soft gradients. Instead, the image now exhibits a minimalist approach with lines and blank spaces rather than any form of gradient treatment.",
