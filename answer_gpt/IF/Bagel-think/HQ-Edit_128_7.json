      "question": "Are there swirling cloud-like structures integrated into the tower's form or surrounding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are prominent swirling, cloud-like structures, especially noticeable around the top spire of the tower, forming a sort of magical or ethereal effect. These swirls appear to be formed by light and energy, distinct from the usual clouds in the sky. This suggests an integration or addition of these swirling structures into the design of the tower or its immediate surroundings.",

      "question": "Are there glowing runes visible along the wooden surfaces of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows various glowing patterns, such as spirals, on the surfaces of the tower. These patterns resemble runes or mystical symbols and are emitting a light, giving the impression of glowing runes along the wooden surfaces of the tower.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the roof been replaced with shimmering crystal spires instead of wooden or thatched material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof retains its original shape and structure, appearing to be made of the same wooden or thatched material as in Image A. The shimmer seen is due to the added visual effects like glowing spirals and light, rather than an actual material change to crystal spires.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there glowing orbs located at the top of each spire on the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a large glowing orb above the main spire, surrounded by swirling lights and patterns. However, these orbs are primarily part of the enhanced visual effects above the spires rather than located directly on top of each spire. There's no clear indication of smaller orbs at each spire head.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees maintain their natural forms, with some added glowing highlights that suggest magical or otherworldly modifications. However, they are not transformed into silver spiral shapes; they remain clearly recognizable as traditional trees.",

      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features birds above the tower, similar to Image A, but they do not appear to be altered to a ghost-like or translucent form. They look solid and retain their natural bird appearance without any significant changes or transparency effects.",
