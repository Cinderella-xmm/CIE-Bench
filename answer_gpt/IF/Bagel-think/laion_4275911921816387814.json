      "question": "Is the dagger now rendered as a soft, plush toy rather than a rigid weapon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dagger is visually rendered as a soft plush toy. The hilt shows characteristics of being stuffed with fabric materials, similar to those seen in plush toys, rather than rigid components like the original image. Its surface pattern, texture, and the way the contours of the hilt are depicted all suggest a transition from a hard, structured material to a soft, yielding form, which is consistent with plush toy designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blade made of soft, silver-gray fabric with black embroidered patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade retains its original intricate patterns. However, the surface appears rigid and metallic rather than a soft fabric. The notion of embroidery implies a textile surface that is not presented here; the blade continues to give the impression of metal with engraved designs as seen in conventional blades.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hilt made of a soft, faux ivory-like fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the hilt as having a texture resembling fabric rather than hard ivory. The fabric texture appears soft and possibly stuffed, which aligns closely with the concept of a faux ivory-like aesthetic made from fabric rather than the rigid ivory material seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all edges of the plush dagger, including the hilt and blade, appear rounded and smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle or hilt appears rounded and smooth compared to a traditional rigid dagger. However, the blade appears unchanged with sharp and defined edges. Thus, not all parts of the dagger exhibit rounded and smooth characteristics; only the hilt does, while the edges of the blade retain their original sharpness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the plush dagger appear stuffed and voluminous, with softened contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dagger's handle as stuffed and voluminous with softened contours, indicating its plush transformation. The volume and texture are reminiscent of plush toys, emphasizing softness through the rounded hilt and bulging fabric appearance. This analysis confirms significant changes compared to the rigid structure seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the plush dagger placed against a solid-colored backdrop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the plush dagger against a backdrop that, while appearing light in color, is not entirely solid due to subtle variations and marks across the surface. The backdrop in both images shows minor inconsistencies and patterns associated with fabric wrinkles or stains, indicating it is not strictly solid-colored.",
