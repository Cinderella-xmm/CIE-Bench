      "question": "Is the man depicted wearing a trench coat and a fedora-style hat consistent with a noir detective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is dressed in a way that closely resembles a typical noir detective, with a coat and a hat that are common attire for such characters. The use of a fedora-style hat and a long coat are iconic elements associated with noir detectives reflecting 1940s-1950s fashion in detective stories. This association comes from common noir film aesthetic portraying detectives in such attire.",

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the background includes architectural outlines, street-like imagery, it doesn't explicitly include dark alleys, wet pavement, or dim lights that are typical of an eerie or noir urban environment.
