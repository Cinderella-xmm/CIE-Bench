      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture on the surface resembles small, overlapping scales, creating a pattern akin to what might be found on a creature or an insect.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray material that was originally in the form of flat bows in Image A appears to have taken the form of wings. The material extends outward in a symmetrical manner reminiscent of wings, deviating from the bow shape displayed originally.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B shows features resembling large eyes with detailed lashes where the white flowers were present in Image A. The white circular shape of the flowers has been altered to include detailed lashes and pupil-like centers, indicating a transformation to eye-like features.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not show the chain from Image A transformed into a serpentine tail that curls beneath the object. Instead, the chain is visually absent from Image B, where other transformations have occurred. Thus, there is no evidence of a tail-like transformation where the chain originally appeared.",

      "explanation": "The shape in Image B retains a generally rounded, upright form akin to a basket, resembling the original shape observed in Image A. Despite various transformations, such as the addition of features making it appear creature-like, the core basket-like silhouette remains.",
