      "question": "Has the black handbag been transformed into a human-like female model with a defined body, posture, and facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on a female model walking down what appears to be a runway. Her clothing, posture, and overall presentation mimic the structural elements and color scheme of the handbag featured in Image A, but this does not point toward a transformation of the handbag into a human form. It's a conceptual representation rather than a transformation of the handbag directly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the model wear a black dress that replicates the pebbled leather texture and curved silhouette of the original handbag?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B is wearing a black dress, which seems smooth and fitted rather than displaying the pebbled texture seen on the handbag in Image A. The silhouette also doesn't directly replicate the handbag; it's more tailored to fit a human model's form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model in Image B is indeed wearing gold jewelry, notably a necklace and earrings, which align with the gold hardware seen on the handbag in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The MK logo is visible on the model's dress in Image B, but it is not displayed as a circular gold brooch; rather, it is in text form printed on the dress fabric.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is visible at the bottom, but it reads 'Stroida Mooh,' not 'Strut the City Streets.' This doesn't match the specified phrase.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a setting resembling a fashion runway with spectators on either side, possibly indicating a luxurious event. However, none of the individuals holding smartphones appear to be holding a traditional camera, and no specific photographer is clearly identified.",

        "No"
