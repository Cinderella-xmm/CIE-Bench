        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features cartoonish animals, whimsical fonts, playful colors, and a fantasy-like setting which are all characteristics of a whimsical comic illustration. In contrast, Image A is a structured, formal diagram representing a process.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the processes are not connected by arrows as in Image A, but there is a path winding through the illustration, which gives a more playful and natural look.",
