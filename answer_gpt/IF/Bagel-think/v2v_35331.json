      "question": "Does the dog and banana appear as a single unified form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither the dog nor the banana appear blended or fused together to form a single object. They are positioned side by side, maintaining their distinct identities. Based on common knowledge, a dog and a banana cannot naturally merge or overlap to form a single unified form without manipulation, and the image does not show any signs of such blending.",

      "question": "Does the blended form retain a realistic appearance without obvious signs of manipulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the dog and the banana in Image B do not appear blended into a single form, the question is not directly applicable. However, assessing the realism of the separate entities, both the dog and banana exhibit natural shapes and colors, suggesting no obvious manipulation in their individual appearances. There is no visible attempt to alter or merge their appearances.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the dog and banana smooth and seamless?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no transition to assess between the dog and banana since they are separate objects. They are positioned next to each other without any blending attempts, so the question is inherently inapplicable. Typically, a seamless transition would involve blending colors and textures, but these two objects remain distinct.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and scale of the blended form consistent and realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the dog relative to the banana are exaggerated, with the banana appearing nearly the same height as the dog, which is not typical. This suggests a manipulated or unrealistic portrayal if considering them in proportion to typical real-world sizes, where bananas are considerably smaller than dogs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the blended form match the original lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the dog and the banana is consistent with the background; both objects are well lit, with no mismatched shadows or highlights. Since there is no blended form to assess, the question can only be answered by looking at each object separately, which do match the lighting conditions of the scene.",
