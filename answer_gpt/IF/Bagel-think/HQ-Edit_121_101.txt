    "Question": "Q1: Is the image presented as a series of separate stamp-like elements arranged in a grid or collection format, each resembling a paper-cut design?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there are no separate stamp-like elements arranged in a grid or collection. Instead, it features a single, unified design with elements within it. The architectural motif, floral elements, and hanbok details are integrated into one cohesive image rather than separated into distinct pieces or stamps.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral embroidery details on the hanbok enhanced with visible metallic foil effects (e.g., shiny, reflective highlights)?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the floral embroidery on the sleeve of the hanbok appears to have a metallic or embossed effect, characterized by shiny and reflective highlights that resemble metallic embellishments. This is a deviation from the more textile and matte appearance in traditional hanbok fabric, suggesting an artistic enhancement to make the details stand out.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the bow on the hanbok been visibly enlarged compared to its original size in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the bow appears prominent, not in terms of physical enlargement, but in its artistic emphasis as part of the design. Comparing with the original image, the bow does not appear to have increased in physical size; the apparent 'enlargement' may be due to its presentation as a design element in the artistic rendition rather than an actual change in proportions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the traditional Korean architectural background clearly visible and properly integrated into the overall composition of the stamp series?",
    "explanation": "The architectural motif in the edited image is indeed visible and integrated into the composition. It forms part of the stylized and embossed design rather than the background setting it functions as in the original image, highlighting it as an artistic element intrinsic to the theme of the piece.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire stamp series displayed on a surface that resembles embossed leather with visible texture and depth?",
    "explanation": "The edited image has a background that resembles a textured surface akin to embossed leather, giving it depth and an enhanced tactile aesthetic. The entire design appears embedded or embossed onto this leather-like background, indicating a unified presentation rather than separate stamps.",
    "answer": "Yes"
