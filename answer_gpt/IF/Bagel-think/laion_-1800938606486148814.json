      "question": "Has the shoe upper been replaced with a transparent material that reveals intricate circuitry patterns inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe upper features visible circuitry patterns, illuminated with neon blue light, creating the impression of transparency. In reality, it may not be transparent, but the patterns and glow suggest an interior view or pattern representation. Combining this visual cue with world knowledge about conceptual designs, which sometimes use patterns to suggest transparency, leads to the conclusion.",

      "question": "Does the Swoosh logo emit a cool neon blue glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Swoosh logo on the shoe is visibly illuminated with a bright neon blue color. This visual cue suggests that the logo is emitting a glow, typical of futuristic or digital design aesthetics. This bright glow is clearly an intentional design choice in the edited image.",

      "question": "Is there a small digital screen attached to the strap that displays dynamic animations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a detailed glow and digital detailing visible on various parts of the shoe, there is no clear depiction of a small digital screen attached to the strap that suggests it is displaying dynamic animations. These elements appear as circuit-like designs but do not represent a screen.",

      "question": "Is there a collapsible digital shoe box with a metallic finish and holographic branding visible in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes an object resembling a futuristic box or container next to the shoe, which emits a blue glow similar to the shoe. However, there is no indication of it being a collapsible digital shoe box with a metallic finish or holographic branding. The visual cues align more with digital styling rather than specific details like a collapsible feature or metallic sheen.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object alongside the shoe shows complex circuitry and geometric patterns, fitting the theme of modern digital or tech-inspired design. These elements appear on both the shoe and adjacent object, suggesting their intentional inclusion as part of a cohesive futuristic aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, although the shoe's design in Image B includes additional futuristic features like glowing elements, digital patterns, and tech-style modifications, the basic structure, and silhouette of the shoe remain consistent. The proportions and overall shape are the same, indicating the original structure is maintained.",
