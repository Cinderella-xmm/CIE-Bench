      "question": "Has the image been converted into a realistic cartoon rendering style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck and its surroundings are depicted with simplified shapes and bold outlines typical of cartoon rendering. The colors are vibrant and solid without gradients or textures typical in realistic images, indicating a cartoon style. The clouds and trees also lack detailed rendering, supporting the conclusion that the image has been transformed into a cartoon version.",

      "question": "Does the truck retain its original structure in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the truck appears to have the same essential parts and structure as in Image A, such as the cab, wheels, and smokestacks. However, the style of depiction is changed to cartoon rendering, which alters its appearance but maintains the underlying structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lines in the truck bolder compared to the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the truck with bold black outlines defining its features, which is a common characteristic of cartoon styles, contrasting with Image A where no such bold lines are present. The lines in Image B are noticeably thicker and more prominent, which is typical in cartoon renderings for clear definition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a bright palette with high saturation for colors, such as vivid reds on the truck and bright blues and greens in the background. Image A features more natural and subdued colors. The increased saturation contributes to the vibrant and vivid appearance of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements, such as trees and sky, are represented with fewer details and solid colors, lacking the texture and detail observed in Image A. This simplification is typical in cartoon renderings to keep the focus on the main subject and maintain stylistic uniformity.",
