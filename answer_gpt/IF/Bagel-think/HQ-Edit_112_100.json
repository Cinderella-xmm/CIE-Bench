      "question": "Is the eagle enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle is visibly placed inside a clear, dome-shaped glass structure. The dome surrounds the eagle and sits on a base, which indicates the enclosure is designed for display or protection. This is evident from the way the glass reflects light and how the eagle and other elements are enclosed within its boundary.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the eagle appear as a 3D stylized sculpture with sculptural features (e.g., defined form, modeling lines, or material texture)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eagle appears to have a very defined and textured form, characteristic of a sculpture. The eagle's features, such as its wings, body, and beak, are clearly modeled with careful attention to shape and depth, indicating that it is not a real or live eagle but rather a crafted representation, typical of sculptures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there miniature swirling clouds located directly under the eagle's wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, directly beneath the eagle, there are sculptural elements resembling clouds. These elements have a swirling shape and are positioned in a way that mimics the appearance of clouds underneath the eagle, enhancing the overall theme of a sky or flight scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds under the eagleâ€™s wings decorated with visible gold leaf accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature clouds under the eagle's wings appear to be uniformly white in color with no visible gold leaf accents. The swirls of the clouds are crafted without any additional color contrast, which would typically suggest decoration with gold leaf.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base of the display made of polished dark wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the display is visually consistent with dark, polished wood. This is evident from the color and texture, as well as the traditional shine associated with polished wood surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the phrase \"Noble Sky Guardian\" visibly engraved on the base of the display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the phrase engraved on the plaque attached to the base of the display reads as 'NObure Torhe Earitlene,' which does not match the phrase 'Noble Sky Guardian.' The engraving appears to be stylized, possibly representing an artistic design rather than real text.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there small brass compass roses placed around the base or exterior of the glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small brass compass rose structures are visible around the platform where the eagle is situated. They are affixed to or positioned near the exterior of the enclosure, which confirms their presence.",
