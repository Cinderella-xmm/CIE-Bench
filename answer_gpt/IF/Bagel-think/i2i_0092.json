      "question": "Is the phone and stand completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only a phone placed on the wooden table, and there's no visible stand like in Image A. This suggests that the stand has been removed. Given this visual cue and considering common objects placed on tables, it can be concluded that the stand is absent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the scene been replaced with a seaside café tabletop setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a phone placed on a wooden table with a sunny and bright ocean in the background. These elements, especially the presence of the ocean and the wooden tabletop typical of outdoor seating areas, strongly indicate a seaside café setting, as opposed to what is typically seen indoors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible sunlight and sea wave reflections on the tabletop?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background prominently displays shimmering sunlight on ocean waves, creating a bright atmosphere. However, these reflections are not directly seen on the table surface where the phone is placed. Given this information, there's no evidence of sunlight and wave reflections appearing on the tabletop itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image include elements that contribute to a seaside café atmosphere (like tables, chairs, or café items)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden table, chairs in proximity, and the view of the ocean together contribute to the typical atmosphere one would expect at a seaside café setting. These elements, visually observed in the image, complement the idea of a casual outdoor dining area near the ocean.",

      "question": "Does the image maintain a realistic tabletop perspective and composition in the seaside café setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the phone resting on a wooden table with a proper alignment and scale, as might be seen from a comfortable seating position in a café. The placement of objects and the natural alignment with the background (ocean view) support this composition, presenting a realistic perspective.",
