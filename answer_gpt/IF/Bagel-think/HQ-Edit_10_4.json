      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing depicted as deeply incised carved reliefs rather than fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns of the clothing are observed to be carved into the wooden texture rather than being part of a fabric. The patterns give the impression of deep incisions, typical of relief sculpture techniques, suggesting that they are indeed part of the wooden sculpture, which contrasts with the fabric depiction typically seen in cloth.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beaded crown and earrings are displayed with vivid colors that contrast the natural wood tones of the rest of the figure. This indicates a deliberate artistic choice of painting over the wooden surface to enhance visibility and vibrancy, akin to traditional wooden sculptures that are sometimes painted to highlight features.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the background with low-relief carvings that depict a jungle scene. The transition from a painted or digitally rendered background in Image A to carved wood in Image B suggests visible depth and texture, typical of traditional relief carving which provides a tactile representation of scenes.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture's surface appears polished and exhibits a rich finish that provides subtle highlights and depth.
