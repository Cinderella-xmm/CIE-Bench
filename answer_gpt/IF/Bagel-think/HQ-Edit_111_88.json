      "question": "Does the dancing woman appear as if made of stained glass with distinct panel-like divisions and dark outlines resembling lead came?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancing woman indeed appears as if she is made of stained glass. This is evidenced by the presence of distinct panel-like divisions throughout the image, with dark outlines resembling the lead came used in traditional stained glass work. The dark outlines clearly define the shapes and segments that characterize stained glass art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the woman’s pose identical to the original, with one leg lifted and arms positioned dynamically as in the source image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's pose mirrors that in Image A with one leg lifted and her arms positioned in a dynamic stance. Both images capture the same essence of movement and balance, indicating that the pose is indeed identical.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the woman’s garments and body adorned with flowing, curvilinear lines and intricate geometric patterns consistent with Art Nouveau design principles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the image adopts a stained glass style, the emphasis is on segmented areas with bold outlines rather than the flowing, intricate style typical of Art Nouveau. The woman's garments do not appear to feature the flowing, curvilinear lines characteristic of this design style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees and huts in the background redesigned with smooth, curving lines and organic shapes typical of Art Nouveau, rather than naturalistic forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and huts are depicted in a simplified stained glass manner with defined outlines. Although the representation is stylized, it does not particularly embody the organic, flowing shapes typical of Art Nouveau but rather remains closer to the geometric segmentation of stained glass.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall color scheme of the image muted and iridescent, resembling colored glass with soft transitions and low contrast, rather than vibrant, saturated colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall color scheme in Image B appears vibrant and makes use of high contrast typical of stained glass artwork, where bright, saturated colors are utilized to create distinct separations between segments rather than soft, low-contrast transitions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire image exhibit a sense of continuous, flowing ornamentation and balanced movement, with decorative details linking the dancer and environment in a unified design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B features a sense of continuity through the stained glass style, it does not incorporate the flowing ornamentation of Art Nouveau. The bold outlines and segmented design disrupt the kind of continuous, interconnected patterns typically associated with such style.",
