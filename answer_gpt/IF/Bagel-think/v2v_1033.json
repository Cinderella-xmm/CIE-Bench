      "question": "Are the collectibles depicted as exquisitely detailed 3D-rendered figures of a bee and a flower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee and flower are designed as 3D-rendered figures. They have a glossy and detailed appearance, which gives them a more lifelike and three-dimensional quality compared to flat designs. This visual information, combined with the understanding of what constitutes 3D-rendered objects, leads to the conclusion that these are indeed detailed representations of a bee and a flower in a 3D style.",

      "question": "Is the display box pastel-colored with a soft cream finish and delicate gold trims?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display box in Image B is pastel pink in color with a smooth finish, which can be interpreted as a soft cream finish due to the close association of pastel tones with softness. There are gold elements inside, particularly where the letters and decorative designs are placed, which can be considered as delicate gold trims. Combining these observations leads to the conclusion that the box fits the description.",

      "question": "Are the bee and flower figures arranged side by side within the box, embodying harmony and friendship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee and flower figures are indeed arranged side by side within the box. The positioning suggests a harmonious arrangement as they are closely placed without obstruction, symbolizing harmony and friendship through their proximity and complementary nature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bee figurine have vibrant, glossy yellow and black stripes along with sparkling, semi-translucent wings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee has vibrant yellow and black stripes, and the surface appears glossy based on the reflections observed. However, the wings are solid and do not appear semi-translucent nor do they exhibit sparkling qualities. Thus, while part of the description is accurate, the wings do not fully match the detailed description given.",

      "question": "Is the lid inscribed with the phrase “ETERNITY BLOSSOM” encircled by dainty star and floral designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inscription inside the lid in Image B reads “ETABT BLSOM” instead of “ETERNITY BLOSSOM.” There are dainty star and floral designs present, but since the key phrase isn’t as specified, the overall description doesn’t hold true. This analysis comes from visually observing the inscription and comparing it to the specified phrase.",
