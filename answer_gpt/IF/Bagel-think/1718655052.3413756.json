      "question": "Are the hat and scarf now made of wood with visible carving marks and engraved textures that mimic the original woolly pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf appear to be made of a material with wood-like characteristics. There are distinct carved marks and engraved textures visible, which contrast with the woolly appearance in Image A. The detailed texture suggests a deliberate choice to mimic the original woolly pattern through wood carving.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the dog's fur coat been replaced with LEGO bricks arranged in a way that shows multiple colors and maintains a layered, textured appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur has been visually altered to appear as LEGO bricks. These bricks are arranged in a layered manner and exhibit multiple colors, giving the appearance of a textured coat. In comparison to Image A where the fur is fluffy and natural-looking, Image B creatively substitutes this with colorful LEGO bricks.",

      "question": "Is the background now a plain, light-colored wooden tabletop with no distracting elements, providing a clean contrast to the dog and its accessories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that consists of a plain, light-colored wooden tabletop. This contrasts starkly with Image A's dark and blurred background with snow, providing a simpler and less distracting backdrop that emphasizes the dog and its accessories more clearly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the dogâ€™s facial features, including eyes, nose, mouth, and expression, remained unchanged from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of the dog in Image B, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and general expression, appear identical to those seen in Image A. There is no visible alteration or change in expression, indicating that these elements have been preserved from the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks used for the coat composed of warm colors such as orange, red, yellow, or brown to visually suggest warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks used for the dog's coat include colors like yellow and other warm tones, which visually suggest warmth. This is a change from Image A, where the coat is a natural fur color. The choice of warm-colored LEGO bricks serves the same visual purpose of suggesting warmth.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the scene still include falling snow, and if so, does it coexist logically with the wooden background and LEGO brick coat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible falling snow, unlike Image A which features snow. The wooden tabletop background and LEGO brick coat in Image B would make the presence of snow less logical, aligning with the absence of snowfall in this edited scene.",
