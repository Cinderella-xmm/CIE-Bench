      "question": "Is the butterfly depicted as a voxel-based 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B appears to be composed of small cubic elements arranged in a pixelated form, often referred to as voxel models. This representation is typical in digital format where objects are constructed using 3D pixels or voxels, akin to a 3D version of pixel art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly's design and style resemble the icons shown in the left image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B has a pixelated, blocky appearance suggesting a voxel-based or pixel art style, which is distinct from the realistic and detailed depiction of the butterfly in Image A. Image A features fine details and smooth gradients typical of realistic photographs as opposed to the simplified, block-based approach seen in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Was the butterfly rendered in Octane at 8k resolution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B does not exhibit the high level of detail, smooth gradients, or high resolution associated with 8k Octane rendered images. Instead, it has a voxel-based, blocky visual style, which indicates a different rendering technique not suggesting 8k Octane quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the butterfly exhibit three-dimensional characteristics such as depth and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears to possess some three-dimensional characteristics due to the voxel-based nature, providing a sense of depth and volume. The cubes forming the butterfly give a 3D block layout, supporting the claim of three-dimensionality even though it's stylized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the butterfly display realistic lighting and shading effects indicative of being rendered in Octane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is characterized by a stylized, blocky design typical of voxel art. It lacks the complex lighting and shading effects that would be indicative of a render from a sophisticated engine like Octane, which is known for producing lifelike visual effects.",
