      "question": "Is the elephant depicted as a smaller-scale version enclosed within a transparent glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays the elephant as a smaller-scale model within what visibly resembles a glass or transparent display case. The presence of a container with clear boundaries around the elephant, and the overall smaller scale of the elements compared to real-life objects, suggests its depiction as a display case item based on common sense and visual cues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate armor details on the elephant rendered with a shiny, metallic-resin-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the armor on the elephant appears shiny and has a texture that resembles metallic resin. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues indicating the reflective qualities and intricate detailing, which align with the characteristics of metallic or resin materials.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there four small golden banners made of silk-like material positioned at each corner of the glass display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, only two small banners are visible, positioned at the back corners inside the display case. They resemble silk-like material due to their draping appearance and soft texture portrayed. However, the lack of four banners — as only two are visible — leads to the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background feature multiple layers of mountains with translucent, soft-edged silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image showcases mountains depicted with soft edges and subdued colors, creating a layered, translucent appearance. This observation is drawn from the visual presentation of mountainous silhouettes that are not sharp but gently blend in with the backdrop.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there are indeed small trees positioned inside the display case that resemble stylized bonsai trees. Their miniature size, detailed shaping, and placement within the case's foreground all support this classification.",
