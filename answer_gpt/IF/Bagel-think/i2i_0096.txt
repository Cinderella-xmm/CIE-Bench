    "Question": "Q1: Does the edited image show a left-side 90-degree view of the sofa alongside the front view?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, we observe a front view of a black sofa situated against a wall. The angle of the view is a direct, frontal perspective, as indicated by the visible back cushions, armrests, and symmetrical alignment of the sofa. There is no indication or evidence of a left-side 90-degree view being represented alongside the front view. The entire composition, including the wall art directly above the sofa, reinforces the notion of a single, frontal viewpoint rather than a composite view that would include a side perspective.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the dimensions of the sofa consistent between the front and left-side views?",
    "explanation": "As determined in the response to Q1, Image B solely presents a frontal view of the sofa. A left-side view is not depicted in the image; therefore, comparisons of dimensional consistency between front and side views are not applicable. The frontal view shows a well-proportioned, three-seat sofa in a balanced perspective, but there is no side view to assess for consistency.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition between the front and side views of the sofa smooth and coherent?",
    "explanation": "Given that Image B only provides a frontal view of the sofa with no side perspective included, there is no visible transition between front and side views. As such, the question of whether this transition is smooth and coherent cannot be assessed or answered based on the image content.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the lighting and shadows on the sofa consistent in both the front and side views?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a singular frontal view of the sofa. The lighting, coming from windows on the left, casts shadows on the sofa that are consistent with the direction and intensity of the light source. Since there is no side view depicted, consistency in lighting and shadows between different perspectives of the sofa cannot be analyzed or confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do objects around the sofa (e.g., wall art) appear correctly scaled and positioned relative to the combined view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall art above the sofa and other elements in the room are visually assessed. The wall art is centrally placed above the sofa consistent with standard interior design practices. The scale and position of the painting and its alignment with the sofa appear well-balanced and appropriate for a singular frontal view layout. This layout maintains spatial coherence, ensuring that all elements are properly scaled and positioned for the provided perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
