    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the image formatted as an educational infographic with structured layout elements such as titles, labels, and text boxes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image contains text boxes and lines but lacks a coherent structured layout, commonly seen in educational infographics. The text is scattered without a clear hierarchy or categorized information, which are hallmarks of such infographics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title “Butterfly Biology Basics” displayed prominently at the top or center of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has texts at the top, but none of these texts state 'Butterfly Biology Basics.' The text is not presented prominently as a title that focuses on biology basics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the anatomical parts (antennae, wings, abdomen, thorax) labeled with monochrome line-drawing overlays on the butterfly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image has some text written in a sketch-like font, but there are no clear anatomical labels for the antennae, wings, abdomen, or thorax directly on the butterfly, which would be indicative of anatomical drawings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are pink flower petals included in the image to represent the butterfly’s feeding preference?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does contain pink flowers. Without explicit text linking them to the butterfly's feeding habits, they cannot conclusively be stated to represent feeding preferences based purely on world knowledge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image contains text boxes, but the text does not mention the butterfly’s role in pollination. The presence of unrelated words and phrases does not offer any explanatory context for pollination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the delicate visual style of the original, with the butterfly's vibrant blue color emphasized as the central focal point. Despite the text additions, the butterfly remains the main visual element drawing attention.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
