    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the boot transformed into a sculpture-like object with a rigid, stylized structure consistent with Art Deco aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot features a highly stylized structure with sharp, angular lines and geometric patterns, resembling a sculpture. This rigidity and the emphasis on geometric design is consistent with Art Deco aesthetics, known for its bold, angular forms and symmetry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embroidered floral patterns replaced with geometric designs such as zigzags, chevrons, or sunburst motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there are no explicit floral patterns visible, the entire surface of the boot is transformed into a series of geometric patterns, with various angular sections. This suggests a replacement of any such patterns with geometric designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the decorative elements on the boot have a metallic sheen and appear as inlaid metal plates or strips rather than stitched leather?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B exhibits a reflective, metallic sheen with surfaces that resemble inlaid metal plates or strips, rather than the texture of stitched leather. This transformation highlights metallic features which resemble inlaid decorations rather than traditional boot stitching.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the heel been redesigned into a stepped, multi-tiered architectural shape with sharp angles and vertical emphasis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heel maintains a basic rectangular shape without any indication of a stepped or multi-tiered architecture. It does not showcase layered or vertical emphasis typical of such a design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot surface exhibit a hard, reflective, non-leather-like finish consistent with metal or polished stone, indicating a sculptural material change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the boot in Image B is glossy and reflective, closely resembling metal or polished stone rather than leather. This indicates a significant material change, giving it a sculptural appearance.",
