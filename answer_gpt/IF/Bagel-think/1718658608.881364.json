        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object in the center appears to have been crafted into a sculpture with a smooth, curved surface. It features tentacles similar to those of an octopus, yet the material appears consistent with ceramic, suggesting a replacement of the organic figure with a ceramic form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the sculptures have a smooth and shiny surface, which is characteristic of glazed ceramic materials. This shine indicates a reflective property typically found in ceramics.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the sculptures with intricate, scale-like textures which provide a pattern reminiscent of natural marine creatures. This design detail connects to the rough texture observed in real octopus skin.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the sculptures in Image B suggests a flowing, wave-like composition. The curvature and positioning of the tentacles mimic the undulating movements of ocean waves.",
