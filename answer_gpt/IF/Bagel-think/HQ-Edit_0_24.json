      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Do the gardening tools (shovel and watering can) appear to have an antique, metallic finish with signs of aging such as tarnish or patina?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gardening tools, particularly the shovel, exhibit a shiny metallic finish without any visible signs of aging like tarnish or patina.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a decorative vine pattern around the border, particularly framing the blank center portion where the ornate text 'Opulrents' is written. This border creates the appearance of vines, suggesting an intentional theme or design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an empty area centrally located, framed by decorative motifs, which is surrounded by floral elements but serves more as a canvas for drawing attention rather than a designated header for monthly details.",
