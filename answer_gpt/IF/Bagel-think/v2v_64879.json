        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the industrial structures are depicted in a style consistent with thick brushstrokes typical of impasto painting techniques.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the winding road is indeed illustrated with thick brushstrokes that suggest dynamic movement and texture. The outlining and shading used on the road increase its visual prominence, characteristic of impasto style.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
