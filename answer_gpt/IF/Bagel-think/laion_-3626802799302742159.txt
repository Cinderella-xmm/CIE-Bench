    "Question": "Q1: Are expressive faces and limbs added to the cookies to make them anthropomorphic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each cookie has various facial expressions that resemble emojis. Some cookies have eyes and mouths which suggest they are anthropomorphized, meaning they're given human-like facial expressions or characteristics. This is not present in Image A, where the cookies simply have red jam centers without any facial features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the image include at least one cookie with a grinning expression, one with a pouting expression, and one with a winking expression?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows cookies with different expressive faces: one has an open mouth resembling a grin, one has a winking eye, and another cookie displays slightly angled eyebrows and a curved mouth, suggesting a pouting expression. This variety of expressions adds to their anthropomorphic character, as opposed to the plain cookies in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is there a tea party scene depicted, including props such as a tiny tea table or teacups?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the inclusion of small toy chairs next to the cookies suggests a playful tea party setting. While there isn't a visible tea table or teacups, the toy chairs imply a setting akin to having a gathering for the cookies, mimicking a tea party. Image A does not contain such elements and only presents cookies placed simply on a plate and cup.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the cup been modified to resemble a clubhouse, such as having windows, doors, or other architectural details?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a cup with floral decorations rather than architecturally significant modifications like windows or doors. The cup is used to hold the cookies, and no clubhouse-like features are visible. Comparatively, Image A also shows the cup as a plain container. No changes to resemble a clubhouse are present in either image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the pink plate been replaced with a floral-patterned picnic blanket?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plate still appears to be hard and round like typical dishware and features floral patterns that are distinctly visible. This differs from a fabric-like picnic blanket's texture or form. Image A's plate is plain pink without patterns. The change is in the design of the plate rather than its replacement with a picnic blanket, maintaining the form typical of a plate.",
    "answer": "No"
