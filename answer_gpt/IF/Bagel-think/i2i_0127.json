        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top left corner features a group of words with 'CLEAN' and 'CLAVEN' prominently visible. The combination of these words along with the positioning suggests an attempt to introduce a slogan. However, the exact phrase 'Clean First' does not seem to appear within this group. Visual cues indicate modifications have been made, attempting to express a cleaning-related slogan.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top left corner of Image B has several words like 'CLEAN' and 'CLAVEN', but the exact phrase 'Clean First' is not visible. The words appear jumbled or layered, which can hinder clear reading, and suggest the content might convey cleaning or hygiene themes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the bottom right corner of Image B, there are discernable words 'MAUN' and 'LEAVLS'. There is no direct indication of the phrase 'Comfort Always', implying that this specific slogan has not been added.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text present in the bottom right corner of Image B reads as 'MAUN' and 'LEAVLS'. The phrase 'Comfort Always' is not seen, indicating that while text has been added, it does not correspond to the specified slogan.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows added text in both corners, which may suggest an attempt to mimic a promotional style. However, the text is not clear, featuring jumbled and misspelled words, such as 'CLAVEN' and 'LEAVLS', which do not convey coherent slogans. Public health promotion materials typically have clear, direct messaging, which this design lacks.",
