      "question": "Does the edited image depict the camera with intricate gears and mechanical components characteristic of steampunk design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is designed with numerous visible gears and mechanical parts around and on the tripod. The presence of these intricate gears and components are prominent visual elements that are characteristic of a steampunk aesthetic, which often incorporates Victorian-era industrial components into its designs. Such an abundance of gears and mechanical details strongly aligns with the steampunk style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the camera and tripod in the edited image rendered with a metallic finish resembling brass, iron, or similar materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of both the camera and tripod in Image B appear to have a metallic sheen and coloring typical of brass, which is a key element in steampunk design. This metallic finish gives the objects a heavy, industrial look akin to materials such as brass or iron, which are common in steampunk aesthetics.",

      "question": "Does the edited image include visible rivets, bolts, or pipe-like structures as part of the camera and tripod design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows details such as bolts and rivets along the camera and tripod, adding to the industrial, steampunk look. These features are intended to mimic the appearance of machinery and mechanical gadgets, which is a frequent characteristic of steampunk themes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image emphasize the metallic textures through strong contrasts and reflections, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting highlights the metallic surfaces, creating reflective glints and strong shadows that accentuate the textures and three-dimensional shape of the camera and tripod. This lighting technique is effective for highlighting metal surfaces, giving the objects a more realistic and dimensional appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image incorporate signs of aging or weathering, such as rust or scratches, on the metallic surfaces of the camera and tripod?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the design is steampunk and metallic, there aren't visible signs of rust or prominent scratches that typically signify aging or weathering. The surfaces appear polished and well-maintained rather than aged or distressed, which is atypical if weathering was intentionally included.",
