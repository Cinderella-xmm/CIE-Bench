      "question": "Has the background been replaced with a steampunk-style train station waiting room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a setting that is visually distinct from Image A. The background appears to exhibit elements typical of a steampunk aesthetic, characterized by elaborate mechanical features, gears, and vintage textures that resemble those commonly found in a train station waiting room from a bygone era. This analysis is based on the visual elements present, such as the large gear-like structures and the industrial atmosphere.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the original lighting and shadows on the wristwatch preserved after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the lighting appears natural, coming from a window, with soft shadows. In Image B, the lighting has changed to match the more dramatic and metallic setting. The reflections on the wristwatch now appear more intense and warm, indicative of a different light source likely tuned to match the steampunk theme. This suggests that the lighting and shadows have been adjusted to integrate with the new background, rather than preserving the original ones.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the new background contain steampunk elements such as gears, metallic textures, or vintage train station features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows features commonly associated with steampunk style, such as gears and components with a metallic finish and a vintage steam engine in the background. These elements are characteristic of the steampunk genre, often reflecting an alternative history of the industrial revolution with a strong focus on mechanical ingenuity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch remains the central focus in the foreground and appears undistorted despite the background changes. The proportions and clarity of the watch are consistent, ensuring it is prominently displayed amidst the busier steampunk backdrop.",

      "question": "Are there visible elements such as steam trains, clockwork devices, or industrial platforms in the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B vividly displays elements like a steam train and industrial components resembling clockwork devices. These features, which are representative of industrial platforms, align well with the steampunk aesthetics that incorporate vintage machinery and industrial themes.",
