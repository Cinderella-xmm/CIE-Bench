      "question": "Has the Sphinx’s head been replaced with a radiant sun disc featuring visible hieroglyphic patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual information shows a circular, radiant object taking the place of the Sphinx's head. This object features hieroglyphic patterns and a radiant appearance, resembling a sun disc. The conclusion is drawn from the presence of circular hieroglyphic designs and sun-like rays extending outward, which are consistent with depictions of a sun disc in Egyptian iconography.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wings on the left side of the Sphinx's body (from the viewer's perspective), which are golden in color and bear hieroglyphic designs. The wings have a shimmering effect due to their golden color and detailed patterns that suggest movement or light reflection, typical qualities of shimmer in images and illustrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

In Image B, the replaced sun disc occupies the position where the original head was in Image A, maintaining the overall composition and alignment.",
