      "question": "Is the figure depicted in a chibi style with an oversized head, large eyes, and simplified proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures have an oversized head in relation to their body, large eyes, and simplified proportions, which are characteristic features of chibi style. These visual cues, combined with common understanding of chibi art as having exaggerated and non-realistic proportions to convey cuteness, indicate that the figures are indeed depicted in a chibi style.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns and bows on the kimono significantly more vibrant and exaggerated in color and size compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon visually analyzing Image B, the chibi figures have floral patterns and bows that appear more vibrant and exaggerated compared to realistic proportions and naturalistic colors in Image A. This is typical of chibi style, where elements are often simplified and exaggerated for effect. The comparison reveals that the kimono in chibi form emphasizes these features more prominently.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there exactly four separate images of the chibi character, each in a unique pose corresponding to holding a cherry blossom branch, catching petals, gazing at blooming trees, and dancing amidst falling flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed four separate images of the chibi character, each in a distinct pose. However, the specific actions described do not exactly match those four poses. While one figure is holding a branch, another might seem to be catching petals, but the remaining poses do not clearly depict the specified actions of 'gazing at blooming trees' and 'dancing amidst falling flowers.'",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does each of the four images depict a clear and distinct action—holding a branch, catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing—with visible movement or interaction with cherry blossoms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The four chibi images show distinct poses, but they do not unambiguously illustrate the actions stated. One figure holds a branch, possibly implying interaction with cherry blossoms, but the others do not clearly match the described actions such as catching petals, gazing at trees, or dancing amidst flowers in a way that makes their actions distinct and clear.",

      "question": "Are the four fridge magnets displayed together on a single pastel-colored surface that appears to be a magnetic sheet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four chibi figures are aligned on a pastel-colored surface, giving the appearance of them being displayed on a unified background. This surface appears consistent with the idea of a magnetic sheet used for fridge magnets. The use of pastel tones can suggest a magnetic sheet commonly designed for aesthetic appeal in household items.",
