        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a sandcastle is depicted in a manner that gives it a crystalline appearance.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the surface of the castle is visually characterized by a subtle blue hue. Such highlights suggest reflection and refraction properties typical of crystal-like materials when light passes through or reflects off them. These attributes are evident on the castle's surface and edges, giving an impression of gentle blue highlights.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean in Image B does not resemble typical fluid water. Instead, it appears as an etched surface, resembling a frosted glass slab.
