      "question": "Is the cathedral and surrounding square depicted at a significantly reduced scale, consistent with a miniature model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral and its surrounding square appear significantly smaller than they would in real life, allowing it to fit within a compact frame. The proportions and scale relative to human figures indicate it's a miniature model. Understanding that the objects and figures are much smaller than real-life counterparts confirms the reduced scale typical of miniatures.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within an ornate, decorative frame featuring baroque-style architectural details such as scrolls, columns, or intricate carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral scene fitted within a simple wooden frame and does not exhibit ornate or decorative features like scrolls or columns typical of baroque style. Thus, based on visual cues, the frame is simple and lacks intricate architectural details.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small-scale human figures present in the square, wearing detailed historical or formal attire, and positioned as if walking or strolling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small human figures are visible in the square. They are dressed in clothing that appears historical or formal, and they are positioned to mimic actions such as walking or strolling, which gives the impression of a lived-in space in miniature form.",

      "question": "Is the cathedral façade uniformly colored in a warm beige tone and visually textured to resemble resin rather than natural stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the cathedral façade in a warm beige color. The surface texture lacks the natural stone appearance found in real cathedrals, instead resembling resin or a similar material often used in models or miniatures. The hint of resin-like texture is discerned through the uniform coloring and smoother surface.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there small, vintage-style lamps placed around the scene emitting a soft, dim, warm glow consistent with antique lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vintage-style lamps are visually placed around the scene. The lamps have a traditional design that suggests antique lighting, although the image does not convey an active glowing effect due to the static nature of photography. The presence and design hint at vintage styling regardless of visible glow.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a visible plaque with engraved text located below the display case. This suggests that it likely contains information identifying the cathedral, possibly including historical context or significant details, which is common for displays and models.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is indeed a painted depiction of a sky featuring visible clouds and color gradients. This artistic background provides depth and context to the miniature scene, with colors transitioning smoothly, akin to a natural sky, confirming the presence of a painted backdrop.",
