      "question": "Is the couple depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated facial features and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the couple is illustrated in a cartoon style characterized by exaggerated features and proportions, which is typical of caricature or chibi-style illustrations. The groom, for example, has notably large eyes, a common trait in cartoon depictions to convey expressiveness in a simplified manner. This differs from realistic portrayal in photographs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the beadwork on the bride’s gown been enhanced to appear more elaborate or exaggerated than in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bride’s gown also appears simplified and stylized as part of the cartoon illustration, which usually lacks the intricate detail found in realistic images. While the beadwork is present, it does not appear more elaborate between the two images. The style is more about simplifying rather than enhancing specific details.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon depiction does not show an enlarged suit lapel; instead, it maintains the proportion just like in the real image, with simplification but not exaggeration in size. The lapel is depicted as a part of an overall simplistic illustration style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features four separate cartoon scenes of the couple, two for each partner, each engaging in activities such as holding a rose and having a dynamic dance-like pose. However, there are no explicit scenes of hand-holding or toasting, rather a general depiction of motion and interaction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each illustration of the couple in Image B is indeed enclosed in a heart-shaped border adorned with a gold trim. This provides a decorative framework that enhances the romantic theme typical for wedding-related illustrations.",
