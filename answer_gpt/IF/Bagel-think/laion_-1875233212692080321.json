      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the original rose petals been completely replaced by a perfume bottle design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly visible object that appears to be a rectangular object, resembling a palette with vibrant colored sections. The absence of a design that explicitly resembles a perfume bottle suggests that no such transformation has occurred. The presence of distinct rectangles hints at designs typical of makeup palettes rather than perfume bottle conversions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a tall, slender glass bottle present with visible etched petal designs on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visible object resembles a palette rather than a slender glass bottle. The object lacks curved edges or features typical of bottles in design. The design, which includes vibrant colored sections, suggests elements related to palettes rather than bottles with etched designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the bottle cap been replaced with a stylized rose-shaped element that has a glossy gold finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible parts of Image B do not show any clear separation resembling a bottle or its cap. The absence of gold-toned or rose-shaped design elements further indicates that no such modification exists in the image, as the section depicting such characteristics is missing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the interior of the bottle show a deep crimson gradient, transitioning from dark to lighter red tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visible part of Image B shows a rectangular palette with vibrant colors. The absence of gradient visualization and the lack of glass material representation suggests there isn't a container that holds such a gradient, common in liquid contents within bottles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a vertical, minimalist gold-colored text logo placed along the side of the bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't display features typical to bottles. It shows a section with different colored rectangles, not associated with text placement on bottles. There's no visible text or logo that fits the description of a gold-colored, vertical logo.",
