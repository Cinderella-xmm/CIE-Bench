    "Question": "Q1: Is there a clearly defined collectible figure present in the image?",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the collectible figure placed on a surface suitable for a desk ornament?",
    "explanation": "The collectible figure in Image B appears to be freestanding without indications of being placed on a desk or specific surface intended for display.

    "Question": "Q3: Does the collectible figure maintain visual harmony with the overall composition of the room?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the room displays a modern, minimalist style with sleek furniture and plants, whereas Image B focuses solely on the collectible figure without background context.

    "Question": "Q4: Does the collectible figure obscure or overshadow key elements such as the mirror or existing decorations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is entirely on the collectible figure with no other elements present like mirrors or decorations that can be obscured. The entire composition centers around this single object, thus it doesnâ€™t overshadow or obscure other elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Does the collectible figure appear seamlessly integrated into the scene as though it is a natural part of the composition?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a standalone collectible figure with no accompanying scene or environment to integrate into. It lacks context within an interior setup like a room depicted in Image A, thus it cannot be naturally integrated into a scene in its current isolated form.",
    "answer": "No"
