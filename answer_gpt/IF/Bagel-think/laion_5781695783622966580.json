    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hat feature distinct geometric patterns such as zigzags, chevrons, or stepped lines typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat displays patterns characterized by angular shapes and lines, including zigzags and sharp geometric forms, which are reminiscent of the Art Deco style known for its bold, symmetrical geometric designs. This analysis is based on the observation of the visually dominant geometric patterns on the hat.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible gold-colored accents along the edge or brim of the hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, there are noticeable gold accents along the brim of the hat which have been added as part of the transformation. These gold tones create a distinct border effect along the edges.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hat display prominent sections of turquoise, cream, and silver in its fabric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat prominently features sections filled with turquoise and cream colors throughout its pattern. There is no apparent silver visible; the pattern combinations of turquoise and cream are predominant, suggesting that silver is not a significant part of the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative patterns on the hat symmetrically arranged across the crown and brim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hat with geometric patterns that appear balanced and symmetrically distributed across both the crown and brim. This symmetry in design is typical for stylized geometric pattern applications.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric or linear patterns on the hat follow or complement the natural wave and direction of the model’s hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the placement and direction of the patterns on the hat do not seem to follow or be influenced by the model's hair; the patterns exist independently of the natural hair wave and direction, adhering instead to geometric placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the hat still positioned on the head in the same way as in the original image, with no change in angle or fit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the hat positioned similarly to how it is in Image A with no apparent change in angle or fit. The position on the model's head remains unchanged; the focus is on the alteration of pattern and color rather than position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Have the model’s facial features, expression, and skin tone remained unaltered from the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B have the model's face blurred entirely, making it impossible to distinguish alterations in facial features, expressions, or skin tone. The analysis focuses only on the visible portions not affected by the blur.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
