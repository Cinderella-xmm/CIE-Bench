    "Question": "Q1: Is the ballerina depicted in a cartoon style with exaggerated proportions and a significantly larger or more voluminous tutu than in the original image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is illustrated in a cartoon style, characterized by simplified lines and a whimsical design. The tutu appears to be large and prominent, fitting the exaggerated proportions commonly seen in cartoon illustrations.

    "Question": "Q4: Are there clearly designated blank areas on the image suitable for adding written messages?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents blank areas, particularly in the background, due to the relatively uniform pastel backdrop.

Image A, with its detailed stage setting and lighting, lacks such clearly designated blank areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are there floral motifs (such as flowers or leaves) present along the borders of the image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the borders feature floral motifs, including flowers and leaves, adding decorative elements typical of artistic or cartoon styles.
