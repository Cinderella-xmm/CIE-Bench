      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the elephant teapot and base, enclosed within a curved glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate a transparent, curved structure covering the entire depicted scene, resembling a glass dome. This dome encompasses the teapot as well as the base, which suggests the use of a covering display typically meant to enclose and protect objects within. Employing world knowledge, such structures are often glass domes used for showcasing and preserving ornate or delicate items.",

      "question": "Are there visible gears and copper-colored accents added to the surface of the elephant teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct details of gears and metallic elements that appear affixed to the surface of the elephant teapot. These components are metallic and feature a copper hue, standing out against the darker base colors of the teapot. Considering world knowledge of design elements, these traits are commonly associated with steampunk aesthetics, where gears and copper accents are used decoratively.",

      "question": "Does the base feature simulated wooden floorboards with scattered tea leaves and tiny silver utensils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, close observation of the base reveals visual elements resembling wood grain layouts indicative of floorboards. Scattered across this base are small objects identifiable by their shape and reflective surfaces as utensils, and a dark scattering that could resemble tea leaves. This combination aligns with the question's specifics and is consistent with world knowledge on depicting whimsical or ornate setups.",

      "question": "Are soft moss accents visibly embedded in the base area inside the glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B shows green texture that resembles moss, contrasting with the wooden floorboards. Such texture, appearing naturally soft and spongy, is visually indicative of moss, commonly used for decorative purposes within enclosed display setups, aligning with world knowledge and aesthetic practices.",

      "question": "Is there visible steam emanating from the tip of the elephantâ€™s trunk?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, white, wispy strands that mimic the appearance of steam can be seen emanating from the tip of the elephant teapot's trunk. Such visuals align with the representation of steam in artistic renderings, applying world knowledge where steam is typically shown as soft, rising wisps, indicating that the teapot is actively producing vapor.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the scene surrounded by intricate, vine-like metalwork that forms part of the dome or base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A thorough analysis of Image B reveals a lack of intricate, vine-like metalwork surrounding the scene. The dome is depicted as clear and smooth, devoid of such embellishment. The base, while visually rich with elements simulating wood and moss, does not support the presence of vine-like metal embellishments. Thus, based on visual interpretation and knowledge of typical dome and base designs, such metalwork is not present.",
