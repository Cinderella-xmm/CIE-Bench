      "question": "Does the image exhibit the visual characteristics of a Mughal miniature painting, such as fine line work, stylized figures, and decorative patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are more vibrant, and the lines are bold, but the characters appear more cartoonish than stylized as seen in traditional Mughal miniatures. The image lacks the intricate detailing and subdued color palette typical of Mughal miniature painting but exhibits bright patterns and vibrant decorative elements. Therefore, it does not conform to the characteristics of fine line work and stylized figures seen in Mughal miniature paintings.",
