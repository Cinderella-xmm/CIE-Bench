      "question": "Does the wombat in the stickers have overly large, expressive eyes and gentle facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat in the stickers is drawn with large, expressive eyes, typical of chibi or cartoon designs. The facial features are designed to be cute and gentle, with a rounded nose and cheeks. This style is often used to evoke emotions such as delight and friendliness. Based on the visual cues and world knowledge of typical sticker designs aimed at being cute and expressive, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Are all six distinct poses correctly depicted in the stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is shown in multiple poses, including arms raised, winking, and gesturing with expressions of surprise or delight. While there are distinct attitudes and gestures, only two poses appear to be repeated (arms raised), giving a total of fewer than six unique poses. These discrepancies suggest not all poses are distinct. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the wombat wearing a fun Hawaiian shirt and straw hat similar to those in the reference image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat wears a green Hawaiian shirt with a simple design and a straw hat. These items closely resemble those in Image A, which also depicts the wombat in a straw hat and a shirt with a tropical, relaxed style. The consistent use of Hawaiian and summery themes in the clothing makes the answer 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Do the stickers include bright tropical tones with hibiscus flowers, palm fronds, or fruity drink designs in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the stickers includes elements like tropical flowers and hearts, but there are no palm fronds or fruity drink designs visible. While there are bright colors that suggest a tropical theme, the absence of specific designs such as palm fronds or drinks leads to the conclusion that the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Are the stickers designed with a dimension ratio of 9:16?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a collection of stickers arranged in a 2x3 grid, which does not follow the typical vertical rectangle aspect ratio of 9:16. Instead, the arrangement appears more square or slightly rectangular, suited to halved proportions. Based on the visual assessment of the grid layout as opposed to the vertical, elongated dimension of 9:16, the answer is 'No'.",
