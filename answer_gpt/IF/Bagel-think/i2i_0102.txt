{
    "Question": "Q1: Is the word “Draft” written in a handwritten font?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the term 'Draft' is actually represented in a handwriting style. This conclusion is drawn from its irregular, cursive form that mimics the natural movement of hand writing rather than the structured and uniform style of typed fonts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the word “Draft” placed on the yellow paper?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is directly overlaid on the yellow paper. This is inferred from the alignment and the positioning of the word over the yellow surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the image resemble a design sketch cover focused on presenting the word “Draft”?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a handwritten word 'Draft' on a yellow paper with a pencil pointing towards it, suggesting a sketching or drafting theme. However, the background items like the laptop and lack of other design elements don't strongly support a formal design sketch cover focused exclusively on a concept presentation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the word “Draft” clearly visible and legible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the image has the word 'Draft', it isn’t fully clear or legible because part of it is obscured or appears scribbled, making the readability challenging.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any elements in the image other than the yellow paper and the word “Draft”?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes a few distinct elements: a pencil, part of a laptop in the background, and the contrasting surface that the paper rests on, making the environment more complex than just the paper and text.",
    "answer": "Yes"
