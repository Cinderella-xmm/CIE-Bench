    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mountains rendered as geometric shapes with sharp angles and flat surfaces instead of realistic contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains have been transformed into angular geometric shapes with pronounced edges and flat planes, typical of abstract or stylized art designs. This process often involves simplifying complex natural forms into more basic geometric representations to emphasize structure over realistic detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the trees depicted as geometric forms, such as triangular or stepped shapes, with no realistic leaf details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases trees as simplified, angular shapes, with clear triangular forms and stepped figures, foregoing realistic details like leaves or branching. This is in contrast to naturalistic representations which incorporate detailed foliage and complex shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the river composed of a series of radiating parallel lines rather than a continuous, reflective body of water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The river in Image B is illustrated using straight, angular lines that emanate outward, rather than depicting the fluid characteristics and reflective surfaces typically associated with bodies of water. This approach focuses more on form and symmetry than on realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all elements in the image outlined with bold, clear lines and filled with solid, unshaded colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs bold lines to define shapes and fills them with flat colors without shading or gradual color transitions. This method helps emphasize clarity and starkness, aligning with graphic design principles where precision and color boldness are prioritized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the reflection in the water a perfectly symmetrical and geometrically aligned mirror image of the foreground elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the water is not detailed with realistic optical properties but rather mirrors the geometric symmetry found in the overall design. It reflects similar angular, structured forms, aligning with the abstraction found throughout the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible gradients or soft shading in the sky, mountains, or water, or are all areas filled with flat, solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B uses flat, solid colors across all elements, including the sky, mountains, and water, with no gradients or shading to soften transitions between colors, typical of design styles that favor distinct color separation over realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image use a vibrant, high-contrast color palette typical of Art Deco design, including bold hues like red, gold, blue, and black?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes an intense, vibrant color scheme characteristic of Art Deco, featuring stark contrasts with bright, bold colors such as reds, golds, blues, and blacks, which are used to convey elegance and modernity through striking and deliberate palette choices.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
