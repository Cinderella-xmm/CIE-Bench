      "question": "Has the overall form of the bicycle been transformed into a creature-like structure resembling a steampunk insect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle has undergone a significant transformation, incorporating elements typical of steampunk and insect-like structures. The presence of clock faces, cogwheels, and a wing-like addition suggest a design inspired by steampunk aesthetics, resembling an insect mechanically. These features give the bicycle a fusion of organic and mechanical characteristics often associated with steampunk interpretations of creatures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the frame components replaced with an exoskeleton structure featuring visible cogwheel joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame still resembles a traditional bicycle, but it is embellished with mechanical features like clocks and gears. However, the core frame structure resembles more of a steampunk version than an actual exoskeleton. The visual elements do not suggest a complete transformation into an exoskeletal form.",

      "question": "Has the bicycle seat been transformed into a detailed, ornate carapace resembling an insect's back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seat area in Image B retains the traditional bicycle shape and does not resemble a detailed insect-like carapace. The bicycle's design incorporates various mechanical and clockwork elements, but the seat itself does not exhibit the intricate detailing or structure typical of an insect's back in a carapace form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have both wheels been replaced with hinged, mechanical leg structures instead of traditional circular wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, both the front and rear wheels remain as traditional circular wheels. The steampunk elements and additional mechanical features are incorporated into the body and frame, but the fundamental structure and design of the wheels do not change to become mechanical leg structures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a noticeable transformation of the bicycle with copper-colored, wing-like extensions prominently attached to the top bar. These additions enhance the steampunk insect-like theme, providing a visually striking resemblance to wings that add a fantastical element to the bicycle's design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle incorporates several clock faces as part of its steampunk transformation. These clocks are strategically placed on the bicycle, with some at the handlebar area. While they exhibit an antique style, they do not seem to display mysterious runes; instead, they contain traditional clock features.",
