      "question": "Does the entire photo exhibit a bright and soft watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements are presented with vivid and soft colors resembling a watercolor painting. This is characterized by a smooth blending of hues and a soft aesthetic that suggests a painted effect rather than a photograph. The colors are brighter and softer than typically seen in high-resolution images, supporting the conclusion of a watercolor style.",

      "question": "Is the ground depicted using semi-abstract brushstrokes with slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the ground does not have sharp, realistic detailing but instead uses brush-like strokes that aim for an artistic representation. The colors appear intentionally blended and blurred, indicative of semi-abstract impressionism. These features resemble brushstroke techniques often found in paintings, contributing to a less defined, abstract presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the background buildings rendered with semi-abstract brushstrokes and slightly blurred colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the background buildings without detailed architectural features; instead, they are presented in softer, smudged forms with blended colors that seem to mimic brushwork. The colors are diffused, not allowing any clear-cut lines, typical of semi-abstract art. This suggests the intention of the editing is to create a painting-like effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image maintain a consistently bright and soft aesthetic throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the entire image—from the skies to the skateboarder and the ground—reflects a uniform use of softened, pastel-like colors and brightness. This consistency suggests an effort to apply a coherent artistic filter across all elements of the image, maintaining a bright and soft aesthetic throughout.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the character’s position and posture been maintained in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, it is evident that the character retains the original position and posture of being on a skateboard with arms raised—a dynamic pose suggestive of motion. Comparing this with Image A, the essential position and posture remain unaltered, demonstrating consistent physical placement of the character.",
