    "Question": "Q2: Are the ice cubes and lime slice depicted with intricate clay textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes and lime slice, like the rest of the image, do not have the usual clear and glossy look that real ice or a fresh lime slice would have.

    "Question": "Q4: Does the overall composition maintain an organic, imperfect look characteristic of hand-sculpted clay?",
    "explanation": "The entirety of Image B possesses an organic and somewhat imperfect quality, characteristic of items that have been hand-sculpted.

    "Question": "Q5: Is the lighting and shading adjusted to enhance the clay-like textures and three-dimensional appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shading are subtle and soft, which emphasizes the three-dimensional form of the clay-like sculptures.
