      "question": "Is the pottery setup enclosed within a transparent glass cloche?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pottery setup is clearly enclosed within a transparent glass dome, or cloche. The glass cloche is evident from the rounded glass covering that encapsulates the scene, making the objects inside the dome appear enclosed and protected. Glass cloches are often used for display and protection purposes, especially in decorative art settings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clay pieces display a vibrant patina with visible coloration (e.g., green, blue, or copper tones) rather than plain gray?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the clay pieces on the table appear in a solid, matte gray color without any vibrant patina or coloration such as green, blue, or copper. This absence of color suggests that the clay pieces have not been glazed or treated to achieve a decorative finish.",

      "question": "Are there miniature fairy figures visible, actively kneading clay, and located among pottery tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a miniature figure resembling a fairy positioned near the pottery setup, characterized by wings and engaging in activity akin to crafting. While the fairy figure is present, there's no explicit action of kneading clay visible in the image. Instead, the fairy appears positioned adjacent to the pottery, which could suggest involvement but lacks direct action depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the setup under the glass cloche is covered with visual representations of green moss and small flowering plants. These patches encircle the wooden structure, lending a naturalistic setting to the scene, suggesting a miniature world where greenery thrives around the pottery setup.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a wooden plaque can be seen at the forefront of the display setup, resting on the inside of the glass dome structure's base. The plaque appears engraved with text, presumably detailing artisan or identifying information that adds context or narrative to the display.",
