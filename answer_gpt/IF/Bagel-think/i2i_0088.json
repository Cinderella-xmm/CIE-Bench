      "question": "Is the fork in the original image now replaced with a spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object on the blue napkin is a spoon, distinguished by its rounded, concave shape that is different from a fork. Common knowledge of cutlery shapes helps identify the utensil as a spoon. Image A features a fork, recognizable by its pronged design. The spoon replacing the fork suggests a change in the utensil present.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a spoon with a golden hue, evident from its shiny, yellowish appearance. Common knowledge associates this color with materials like gold. Without referring to Image A, the color in Image B is clearly gold.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle of the spoon displays intricate designs engraved along its length. These patterns are decorative elements, as they are not functional parts of the spoon but add to its aesthetic value.",
