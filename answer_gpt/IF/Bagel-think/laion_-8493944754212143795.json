      "question": "Is the waterfall and surrounding rocks visibly transformed into the shape of an aquatic dragon emerging from the water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly visible dragon-like creature with blue glowing accents that seem to emerge from the waterfall area. The creature is artfully integrated into the landscape, suggesting a transformation from natural elements to a dragon. The posture and design of the creature are indicative of a mythical aquatic dragon coming out of the water.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the flowing water appear as a shimmering, translucent mane extending from the dragon’s head or neck area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added dragon features have glowing blue elements, but the flowing water itself does not distinctly serve as a mane extending from the dragon’s head or neck. Instead, the dragon is rendered with its own defined features separate from the natural water flow.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocks reshaped into a scale-armored body structure that forms the torso or limbs of the dragon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's torso and limbs appear as a separate entity adorned with a scale-like texture, standing out against the waterfall and rocks. The dragon's design includes distinct physical features that do not seem to be a reshaping of the existing rocks but are rather layered on or around them.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the white foam areas form two distinct, misty cloud-like wings attached to the dragon’s back or sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white foam from the waterfall does not form distinct wings. Instead, the dragon is depicted without any apparent wing structure made from the white foam or surrounding water. The foam remains part of the natural flow and does not represent wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there glowing blue runes visible along the dragon’s scales, appearing as luminous symbols or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the dragon is decorated with glowing blue accents, which look like patterns or embellishments along its body. These glowing features contribute to a magical or mystical appearance, similar to runes. This indicates a design element suggesting glowing designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a dragon with bright blue glowing elements that highlight its scales and outline, enhancing the mystical aesthetic. The lighting around these features creates an ethereal glow, contributing to the fantastical and mystical feel of the image.",
