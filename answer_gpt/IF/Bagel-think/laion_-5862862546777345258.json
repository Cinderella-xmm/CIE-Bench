      "question": "Is the entire church and square scene enclosed within a visible baroque-styled dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure depicted is not enclosed within a dome. Instead, it is an open-air diorama representing the church building and surrounding area, without any enclosing dome structure. Therefore, based on the visual cues where no enclosing structure like a baroque-styled dome is visible, the answer is derived.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the church depicted with a glossy, white or off-white porcelain-like surface featuring intricate painted or molded details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the church in the diorama has a smooth, uniform off-white finish that resembles porcelain or a similar material. The structure and details are precisely molded, which gives it an appearance akin to a crafted porcelain item. This analysis relies on observing the texture and coloration that matches common attributes of porcelain items.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures in the scene replaced with small, metallic gray pewter-like figures with detailed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures are small and stylized with minimal features. However, they are not metallic gray or pewter-like. They appear to be in muted colors but not of metallic appearance, indicating they are not representing pewter. This observation is made from the color and material properties visible in the figures.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire diorama placed upon a visible base made of textured, veined, or aged-looking marble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base visible in Image B is smooth and has a simple design, but it does not exhibit the traits typically associated with textured, veined, or aged marble such as intricate vein patterns or aged appearance. It lacks the marble-like complexity, appearing more like a platform without significant textures.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the café tables in the scene rendered as small, transparent, or reflective glass objects with delicate structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the café tables appear solid and opaque, not made from glass or reflective materials. They are uniformly colored and fit within the stylistic representation of the diorama without showing transparency or reflection typical of glass. This conclusion is based on the lack of visual qualities like transparency or reflectivity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the trees in the scene made of transparent or translucent glass with visible internal details or refractive qualities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are made from a material with a consistent solid coloring, resembling traditional representations found in model kits. They do not possess transparency or refractive qualities that would suggest they are made from glass or have visible internal details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the scene exhibit a cohesive, elegant aesthetic with rich textures and balanced lighting that conveys a sense of vibrancy and timelessness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a small, stylized diorama with uniform coloring and simplified textures, creating a cohesive and charming aesthetic. However, it lacks the rich textures and detailed lighting that convey a sense of vibrancy and timelessness. The styling is more playful and simplistic, rather than rich and elegant. This analysis comes from observing the overall intricacy and execution of the diorama's finish.",
