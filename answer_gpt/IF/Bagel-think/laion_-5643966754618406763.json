    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the stack of tires reshaped into a creature resembling an armadillo with a segmented, armored back made from the tire treads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues indicate a creature resembling an armadillo with a distinct armored back that has textures similar to tire treads. The segmented pattern visible on the back is characteristic of an armadillo’s armor and suggests the use of tire treads in the creature's design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible metallic joints located within the openings between the tires, suggesting mechanical articulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are clear visual elements of metallic joints connecting the various parts of the creature's body. These metallic joints imply a mechanical articulation, consistent with the design of the creature as a robotic entity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the central wheel hubs been replaced with glowing mechanical eyes that emit light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature features bright, glowing elements that resemble eyes, positioned where one might expect wheel hubs in a tire stack. These glowing elements suggest mechanical eyes that emit light, adding to the robotic aesthetic of the creature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there antennae-like structures extending from the top of the creature, featuring electric blue accents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes antennae-like structures extending from the head of the creature, with electric blue accents. These extensions contribute to the technological and futuristic appearance of the creature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature feature steampunk-style elements such as gears, rivets, or brass-colored metalwork, giving it a mechanical guardian appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature exhibits mechanical features like metallic joints and glowing parts. However, there are no explicit steampunk elements like gears, rivets, or brass-colored metalwork visible. The appearance is more aligned with modern robotics than steampunk.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the original tire tread patterns still visible and used as part of the creature’s armored exterior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature's body design in Image B includes distinct tire tread patterns used on the armored exterior, maintaining the visual texture of the original tires. These tread patterns contribute to the mimicry of an armadillo's segmented armor.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the creature have a posture or design indicating it is capable of movement, such as being balanced on wheels or having rolling components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a creature with a design that implies movement. It stands on four limbs, suggesting locomotion, but it does not appear to be reliant on wheels or rolling components for movement. It is structured more like a walking robotic entity.",
