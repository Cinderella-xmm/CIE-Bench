      "question": "Is the spaceship visually transformed into a style resembling a Greek amphora painting, with flat, stylized forms and decorative borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spaceship has been transformed into an art style similar to Greek amphorae paintings. The visual cues include flat and stylized forms with a noticeable shift from realistic depiction to an ornamental and abstract interpretation. This transformation is characterized by simplified and outlined shapes that are commonly found in ancient pottery art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there visible stylized circular motifs incorporated into the design of the spaceship?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible stylized circular motifs within the pattern of the spaceship. This is inferred from the swirling and circular patterns surrounding the object, which are indicative of decorative motifs often used in ancient pottery designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the spaceship include intricate meander patterns as part of its design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no distinct meander patterns, which are typically linear and geometric. The design incorporates swirling motifs rather than the repetitive geometric meander patterns, drawing more from abstract swirls than from traditional meander designs.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the landscape below been transformed into elongated abstract waveforms rather than realistic terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape has been altered to elongated abstract waveforms. The transformation is characterized by lines and patterns that replace the realistic depiction with a stylized interpretation, commonly found in abstract or decorative art styles.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question": "Is the color palette of the landscape composed primarily of muted earth tones consistent with ancient pottery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette of the landscape primarily utilizes muted earth tones such as browns and beiges, reflecting colors typical in ancient pottery art. These colors provide a harmonious consistency with the transformed style of ancient pottery aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape been preserved despite the stylistic changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylistic changes, the spatial relationship between the spaceship and the landscape is preserved. The edited image sustains the positional setup and orientation seen in Image A, indicating that the relative positions and overall composition remain consistent.",
