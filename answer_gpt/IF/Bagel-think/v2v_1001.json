    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is there a ketchup bottle positioned in the lower-right corner of the image, angled slightly toward the center?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle of ketchup is positioned on the left side, not the lower-right corner, and it is not angled particularly toward the center but is facing front. The image clearly shows this object, making it easy to identify its placement and orientation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” displayed in the middle of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text on the image is 'The king Kynars', not 'The king of flavors'. This text is also placed towards the top center of the image, not the middle. The visual cues do not match the description, leading to a conclusion based on discrepancy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text “The king of flavors” crafted in a glossy, ketchup-style script font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B reads 'The king Kynars', and it indeed appears in a glossy, ketchup-style script font. The shininess and red coloring are distinct and reminiscent of ketchup, although the words differ from those in the question. This leads to a conclusion about the style based on its appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the letters of “The king of flavors” appear to hover in the air and subtly mingle with the mist of the forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'The king Kynars' in Image B does appear to have a floating effect against the misty background, suggesting an interaction with the mist of the forest. However, the actual words are different from 'The king of flavors'. This comparison and distinction involve observing the style and placement against the background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there streams of ketchup visually linking back to the opened bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible streams of ketchup connecting back to the ketchup bottle. The bottle appears closed, and no such ketchup streams are present to form a connection, which is evident from clearly observing the entire scene.",
