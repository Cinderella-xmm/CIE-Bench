    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the scene appear as a digitally rendered holographic installation with visible projection-like effects such as transparency, layering, or digital glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features elements that are commonly found in holographic installations, such as glowing effects, vibrant colors, and translucent surfaces that suggest digital rendering rather than real-world structures. There are distinct light trails, layered glass-like panels, and luminous effects that give the impression of digital projection technology.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls depicted as animated light projections on transparent or reflective glass surfaces instead of natural flowing water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls appear to be stylized with bright, glowing digital effects that suggest they are light projections rather than natural water flows. The vertical lines and illumination resemble digital screen displays on reflective surfaces, creating a sense of artificiality.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees feature visible iridescent, glowing filaments resembling fiber optics embedded within their trunks and branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are depicted with glowing lines and dots throughout their structure, reminiscent of fiber optic cables emitting light. This appearance is consistent with iridescent or luminescent effects often associated with digital or technological enhancements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the vines appear as virtualized, looping structures with light trails or animated effects, forming a kinetic light sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows vines that have luminous loops and glowing trails, suggesting animated, virtual installations rather than natural growth. These loops give the impression of being curated as part of a light-based art piece, reflecting digital creative expression.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the environment integrated with futuristic architectural elements such as glass panels, geometric structures, or artificial lighting that blend with the natural forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a combination of natural forms and architectural elements such as glass panels and artificial lighting, creating a blended environment. These panels with bright digital projections indicate futuristic design integration, contrasting with the natural shapes of trees and foliage.",
