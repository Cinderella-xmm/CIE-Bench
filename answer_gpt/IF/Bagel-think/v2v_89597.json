      "question": "Has the central touchscreen been transformed into expressive calligraphic strokes and graded ink washes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central touchscreen's appearance has markedly changed from a digital interface to something that visually resembles calligraphic strokes and ink washes. The usual coherent details of the interface are obscured or depicted abstractly, indicating a transformation into an artistic form resembling calligraphy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the screen's interface and airflow graphics dissolved into expressive calligraphic strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graphics on the screen appear to be composed of abstract, flowing lines similar to calligraphy, rather than the structured and clear interface with airflow graphics seen in Image A. This suggests that these elements have been converted into artistic strokes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the dark wood paneling been replaced with bold, freehand brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood paneling area is represented by freehand brushwork. The orderly, grainy texture typical of wood paneling is gone, replaced by dynamic, black strokes that suggest freehand drawing.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image capture the spirit of technological flow through an ancient artistic lens?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B translates modern technological features into abstract forms reminiscent of ancient art styles, such as calligraphy and ink washes. This transformation symbolizes a blending of technology with traditional art, reflecting the spirit of technological flow through an artistic lens.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Has the overall composition and layout of the vehicle interior been maintained?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B alters the visual style of the elements, the underlying layout and composition of the vehicle interior, like the position of the touchscreen and dashboard, remain consistent with Image A. The transformation affects the visual rendering but not the structural composition.",
