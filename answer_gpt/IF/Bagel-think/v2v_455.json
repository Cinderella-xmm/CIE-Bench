    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the background of each sticker transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sticker has a consistent, clearly defined white outline which suggests that the background beyond this is not transparent but rather has been filled with white. Usually, a transparent background does not exhibit such a solid and uniform color within the confines of each sticker, hence indicating the absence of transparency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stickers arranged in a 3x3 layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By observing Image B, the layout of the stickers is such that they are arranged in three rows and three columns. This results in a 3x3 grid formation of nine stickers, which confirms the queried layout format.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all stickers maintain a square 1:1 aspect ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker in Image B appears to have cartoon images that are non-square, with notable varying heights and widths relative to one another. A 1:1 aspect ratio implies an equal measurement in height and width, which isn't present here due to the shapes and designs appearing to differ between each sticker.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the stickers exhibit a Chibi Ghibli cartoon aesthetic with bright, vibrant colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers show a character in a Chibi style, characterized by exaggerated features like oversized heads relative to their bodies, common of Ghibli-inspired designs. However, the colors are somewhat muted rather than vibrant and bright, more closely resembling a softer palette typical in a less vibrant rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does each sticker portray the character in a distinct snowboarding action, emotion, or scenario?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual examination of Image B shows that while each sticker has the same character, they vary in positions and items, illustrating different activities like holding flowers or a snowboard. This suggests they are showing a variety of actions or emotions, each slightly different from the others.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the character depiction in each sticker complete, with no parts omitted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each sticker in Image B presents a full-bodied depiction of the character with no noticeable cropping of important elements such as limbs or props, which indicates completeness in portrayal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all stickers feature a uniform white outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Every sticker in Image B has a consistent white outline encircling the design, providing uniformity across each sticker's border. This consistency in outlining suggests a deliberate stylistic choice.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are there any extra or disjointed elements outside the primary design of the stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary focus is on the character designs themselves, with no disjointed or separate elements present outside the central depicted image inside each sticker. The clear-defined boundary indicates the absence of extra elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon detailed inspection of Image B, there appears to be no textual content incorporated within any of the stickers. They only exhibit visual figures and motifs, with nothing depicting letters or characters.",
