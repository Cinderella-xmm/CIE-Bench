    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the title \"Bali's Majestic Legacy\" clearly displayed on the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title is presented at the top of the design in visually distinct, albeit unintelligible, text format. Though indecipherable, the expected clarity associated with titles is absent, suggesting it's not displayed clearly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dancer's dress feature intricate golden batik patterns and vibrant red colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B is predominantly red and features decorative patterns that are extensive, though they appear more as floral embroidery rather than batik with golden details. Therefore, the interpretation of intricate golden batik specifically is inaccurate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the temple rendered in a line-drawn style using sepia tones instead of realistic colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a monochrome style on the temple and mythical creatures, depicted in sepia-like tones rather than a realistic color palette, unlike typical vibrant representations of Balinese architecture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the temple centered in the composition, with the mythical creatures placed symmetrically on either side?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the temple is positioned centrally, flanked symmetrically by two mythical creatures on each side, creating a balanced visual alignment in the overall composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there blocks of informative text about Balinese dance and architecture written in elegant serif fonts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B contains sections filled with text written in serif fonts, typically associated with informational or historical content. Although indecipherable, this design choice suggests the intent to convey informative content about Balinese culture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the visual elements (dress, headdress, dance pose, temple design, and mythical creatures) reflect authentic Balinese cultural symbols and traditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B aim to display Balinese cultural symbols: the dancer's attire, pose, temple architecture, and mythical creatures mimic traditional Balinese features, enabling a reflection of Balinese cultural heritageâ€”even if stylized differently.",
