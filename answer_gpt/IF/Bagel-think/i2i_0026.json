      "question": "Does the illustration include four frames showing the stages of prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, four distinct frames are visible, each depicting sequential movements commonly associated with playing tennis: the preparation before the shot, the swing action, the contact with the ball, and the follow-through. The arrangement of these frames in sequential order suggests stages of a tennis stroke. Using world knowledge of common tennis actions, it's rational to identify these as prepare, swing, hit, and follow-through.",

      "question": "Is the illustration drawn in clean line art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a drawing with well-defined black outlines typical of line art. The simplicity and clarity of these outlines are characteristic of clean line art, which avoids excessive detailing or shading to maintain focus on clear lines and form.",

      "question": "Does the illustration use monochrome color fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only black and white are used in the drawing, without any additional colors. The consistent use of these two shades across the illustration defines it as monochrome color fill.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exclusively consists of figures drawn against a plain white backdrop. There are no additional elements or details that indicate any form of background, signifying its complete removal.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frames in Image B are aligned side by side from left to right, resembling a strip. This horizontal arrangement is similar to instructional guides that use sequential frames to depict a process or action step-by-step.",
