      "question": "Is the title \"A Capybara’s Sydney Escape\" displayed prominently on the image, arching above the Opera House?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a prominent text displayed on the top half of the image. This text runs parallel to the top edge in a white, bold style and does not arch above the Opera House. Instead, it is positioned to the left and above where the Opera House appears, without any arching effect towards the structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the image combine photorealistic rendering of the capybara and environment with illustrated or stylized elements (e.g., exaggerated features, cartoon-like details)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a capybara with a photorealistic texture often seen in rendering; however, the addition of textual elements and stickers incorporate a more stylized, illustrative approach. These features, along with the vibrant settings, contribute to a synthesis of realistic and somewhat cartoonish aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a bold, playful font used for the title, and is it arched above the Sydney Opera House?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B uses a bold and noticeable font. However, it does not have an arching feature over the Opera House. Instead, it is aligned parallel to the top edge of the image, positioned clearly but flat rather than arched.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the colors of the beanie and drink are natural and typical, while in Image B, their hues indeed appear more vivid. This is indicative of increased saturation and vibrancy in Image B compared to Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish beach-themed stickers are visible below the capybara's neck area, not on the beanie. These include playful designs, demonstrating an illustrative style. However, they are not placed on the beanie itself.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to showcase the Sydney Opera House in the background. This landmark is depicted with the same distinct shapes and placement over the water against the sky, maintaining clarity and its recognizable architectural form.",
