      "question": "Has the body of the guitar been transformed into a dragon's torso with organic, beast-like features such as scales or musculature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the guitar features artistic dragon elements, such as draconic engravings and patterns that reflect the aesthetic of dragon scales and organic textures. However, the body itself remains a guitar shape rather than undergoing a complete transformation into a dragon torso. The visual cues show added dragon imagery, but not a physical conversion into a dragon-like body.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the guitar neck remains in its usual guitar form, as no significant changes have been made to its shape or design aside from artistic dragon motifs.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headstock has been modified to include golden horn-like spikes protruding from it, distinctly different from the original tuning pegs seen in standard guitar designs like those in Image A.
