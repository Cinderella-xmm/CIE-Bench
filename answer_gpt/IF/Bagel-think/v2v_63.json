      "question": "Are there five chibi-style Russian nesting dolls representing the individual?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe a set of five Russian nesting dolls placed on the table next to the TV. The dolls are designed in a chibi style, characterized by oversized heads and small bodies, reflecting the traditional look of nesting dolls but with a stylized modern twist. They collectively appear to mimic the presence of the individual standing next to them.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the nesting dolls sized from biggest to smallest in a progressive manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, careful observation shows that the dolls are arranged in descending order of size, starting from the left with the largest doll and progressively smaller dolls towards the right. This arrangement is typical for nesting dolls, which traditionally fit inside one another.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nesting dolls accurately reflect the individual's attire and stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals that the nesting dolls are fashioned with a similar color scheme (a red-colored outfit) and design details as the individual's attire, which is a red top and blue jeans. The stance and pose also seem to mimic the person holding the TV, suggesting a purposeful reflection of the individual's style in the dolls.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are organized in a row, spaced evenly on the wooden table right beside the TV, creating a neat and orderly appearance. This consistent arrangement contributes to a visually pleasing setup.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain an aspect ratio of 3:2?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B visually maintains well-composed proportions, there is no direct cue indicating a specific aspect ratio like 3:2. Such determinations typically require measurement or calculation of image dimensions rather than visual inspection, unless specified. Given this, an aspect ratio of 3:2 appears unlikely based purely on observation.",
