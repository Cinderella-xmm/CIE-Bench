      "question": "Is the teapot now a cylindrical container instead of its original rounded shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot has a more cylindrical shape compared to what would be considered a spherical or rounded shape. The base and body seem more extended vertically, giving it a cylindrical appearance rather than the rounded body typically seen in more traditional teapots. In Image A, the teapot is clearly rounded, resembling the typical teapot shape with a bulbous body. Therefore, when comparing both images, the teapot in Image B is indeed more cylindrical.",

      "question": "Are floral patterns embossed in golden foil on the surface of the teapot container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the teapot surface have a distinct golden color and appear to be embossed, suggesting the use of golden foil for the design. The embossed look is derived from the shadows and highlights that create depth, which is typical for embossed patterns. In Image A, the floral patterns are painted and not embossed. Hence, in Image B, the patterns are indeed embossed in golden foil.",

      "question": "Are the teacups redesigned as nested stackable units, each with a decorative lid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a stack of teacups with what appear to be decorative lids on top, indicating that they are designed to be nested and stackable. This stackable feature is not observed in Image A, where the cups are arranged separately and do not have lids. Therefore, the design in Image B allows the cups to be used as stackable units with lids.",

      "question": "Is there Japanese calligraphy displayed across the top of the packaging design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is visible Japanese calligraphy on top of the stackable cups, indicating a decorative or branding choice possibly reflecting culture or content. This is not evident in Image A, where such calligraphy does not appear on the teapot or cups. Therefore, Image B includes Japanese calligraphy across the design.",

      "question": "Is a bamboo motif visible along the side of the packaging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible bamboo motif seen along the side of the packaging. The design elements include golden embossed floral patterns and Japanese calligraphy, but no bamboo motif is discernible. Image A does not have anything resembling a bamboo motif either. Consequently, there is no bamboo motif in the design.",

      "question": "Is the entire tea set packaging presented on a flat white surface with no other background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire tea set is indeed presented on a flat white surface. The background is minimal, with no additional elements visible other than the tea set itself. This is a contrast to Image A, where the tea set is placed on a textured mat with a shoji screen behind it. Thus, the presentation in Image B is on a white surface with no other background elements.",
