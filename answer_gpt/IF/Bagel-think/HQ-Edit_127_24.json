    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the chalets now made of crystalline ice with visible frosted spires and snowflake-patterned walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows structures that visually resemble chalets transformed into crystalline ice forms, evident from the frosted spires extending from one of the buildings and the snowflake-patterned walls. These elements of design and material are characteristic of ice sculptures and fantasy settings, which indicates the structure is made of ice.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the pine trees been transformed into towering ice sculptures with delicate icicle branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image features trees that appear to have been transformed into ice sculptures. They are towering, and their branches resemble icicles or crystalline structures, which align with the characteristics of an ice sculpture rather than natural pine trees.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the ground been replaced with a shimmering, glowing ice surface rather than regular snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the ground as having a shiny, reflective quality typical of ice surfaces rather than the subtle texture and opacity of regular snow. This transformation could suggest a glowing ice surface, contributing to a fantastical look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are swirling auroras visible in the sky above the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) clearly displays swirling lights in the sky, characterized by the distinct colors and patterns typical of auroras. These lights contrast with the nighttime sky and complement the fantastical appearance with visible auroras.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire scene convey a cohesive, fantastical, and dreamlike winter realm through the integration of crystalline structures, glowing ice, ice sculptures, and auroras?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene integrates several distinct elements: crystalline structures for chalets, luminous ice surfaces on the ground, ice-like trees, and overhead auroras. These elements collectively create an otherworldly, fantastical, and dreamlike winter landscape, differing significantly from realistic settings.",
