    "Question": "Q1: Does the painting visibly extend beyond its frame to create a 3D effect?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the painting is within the frame and there are no visible extensions that suggest a 3D effect. World knowledge of paintings that typically remain flat unless intentionally designed as 3D supports this analysis.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the elements from the painting visually merge into the room environment, such as appearing on the wall or floor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elements of the painting, including trees and water, remain confined within the frame. There are no visual cues indicating that elements from the painting extend or merge into the wall or floor of the room. This is consistent with typical paintings that are separate from their surroundings.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the transitions between the painting and the room environment smooth without any abrupt edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the painting is clearly defined within its frame, and there are distinct edges where the painting meets the frame. This creates a separation between the painting and the room environment. Therefore, there are abrupt edges rather than smooth transitions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original elements of the painting, such as trees, water, and the sun, still identifiable in the edited version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, within the painting, the original elements such as the trees, water, and sun are clearly visible and unchanged. This indicates that the essential components of the painting remain identifiable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows in the extended portions of the painting match those in the actual room environment?",
    "explanation": "There are no extended portions of the painting interacting with the room environment in Image B. The painting stays within its frame and does not physically extend into the room; hence, there are no lighting or shadow interactions to evaluate.",
    "answer": "No"
