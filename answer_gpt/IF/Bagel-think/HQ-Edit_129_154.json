    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall shape of the object now clearly that of an owl rather than a teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has been transformed into an owl figure, recognizable due to its distinct avian features like a head, eyes, and wings, rather than the original teapot form as seen in Image A. The object's overall silhouette and positioning convey the common attributes associated with an owl.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lid of the original teapot form the crown-like head of the owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the lid of the teapot was its topmost part. In Image B, the owl's head, including crown-like head detail, might have resulted from altering or repositioning those elements, resembling a crown atop the owl's head, a common depiction for owls.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original engravings now transformed into metallic feather-like patterns covering the owl's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images feature intricate engravings, but in Image B, these have been repositioned or modified into feather-like patterns that adorn the owl's body, using similar detailing to imitate feathers, a recognizable feature in depictions of owls.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the spout been reshaped into a sharp, mechanical beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the teapot's spout is an elongated structure typical of pouring vessels. In Image B, this part appears to have been reimagined as the owl's beak, a sharp-looking component resembling the characteristic pointedness of an owl's beak.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the handle been transformed into a gracefully curved tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the ornate teapot handle from Image A doesn't appear as a curved tail on the owl. Instead, the branch the owl sits on might lead to confusion on the transformation intent, revealing that a tail transformation is not evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there two glowing eyes made of cogs visible on the owl's face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's face is prominently characterized by its eyes, which are luminous and incorporate mechanical cog elements, typical of steampunk or mechanical designs. This is distinct from the decorative patterns seen in Image A's teapot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the owl positioned on a richly carved wooden branch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is visibly perched on a wooden branch that's detailed and exhibits curves and textures, assisting in naturalistic scenes common in artistic depictions of birds in their habitats. This branch existence and representation is distinct from the teapot's base seen in Image A.",
