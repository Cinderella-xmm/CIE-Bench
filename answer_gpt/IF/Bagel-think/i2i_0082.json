    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the clock been designed with a metallic material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock has a shiny surface with reflective properties, resembling a metallic material. It contrasts with the matte and simple design of a typical wall clock, which suggests the adaptation into a metallic appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the badge pendant preserve the minimalist circular frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge maintains a circular shape without any additional design complexity. The frame appears consistent with a minimalist style, providing a straightforward and clean presentation akin to the original clock's design retaining simplicity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the proportions of the clock hands been preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock hands in Image B, while resembling those typical of a clock, seem slightly off in proportion compared to the straight, uniformly sized hands seen in Image A. The adaptation suggests a potential change, making the hands look thicker or differently proportioned on the badge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a visible feature such as a loop or hook indicating the pendant can function as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendant does not display any loops, hooks, or extensions that would typically be used to attach a pendant to a keychain. It appears to be simply a circular object with no visible means for attachment, indicating it does not function as a keychain.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no additional elements besides those necessary for converting it into a metallic badge pendant?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the pendant does not include extraneous design elements beyond its functional and aesthetic design. This suggests the adaptation focuses purely on the transformation into a metallic badge without adding unnecessary features.",
