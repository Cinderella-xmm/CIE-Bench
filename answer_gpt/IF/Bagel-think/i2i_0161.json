      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title displayed prominently across the top of the image reads 'CAS THE WIOLE.' The expected phrase 'Catch the Wave' does not appear, although the placement above the horizon is consistent with where such titles might typically be placed in promotional or thematic images for emphasis. Hence, my analysis shows that the specific title does not match.",

      "question": "Is there a note in the bottom-left corner that reads “Summer Adventures – 2025”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom-left corner contains some illegible text or a distorted set of characters, which does not read 'Summer Adventures – 2025.' Therefore, based on visual analysis, the note does not contain the specific text or year mentioned.",

      "question": "Is the title “Catch the Wave” visibly larger compared to other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title in Image B 'CAS THE WIOLE' is indeed large and prominent, ensuring it stands out compared to other textual elements within the image. Nonetheless, the specific title does not say 'Catch the Wave,' so evaluation requires understanding size and impact, though not content.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'CAS THE WIOLE' is situated above the horizon line, a typical placement enhancing visibility and emphasis. However, because the title differs from 'Catch the Wave,' the actual positioning is not directly applicable; hence, despite correct placement strategy, specifics deny accuracy.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the bottom-left corner of Image B is not clear or readable, and it does not contain the year '2025.' Based on visual inspection, there is no inclusion of the specified year in this region of the image.",
