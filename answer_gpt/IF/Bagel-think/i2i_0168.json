      "question": "Is the background replaced with snow and icebergs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background consists of snow-like elements with an appearance of icebergs, typical of a cold or Arctic environment. This visual aspect is significantly different from any ordinary landscape without snow or ice. Therefore, the background appears to have been replaced with snow and icebergs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the carrots still rooted in soil?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots appear to be surrounded by white material resembling snow, rather than the typical dark soil in which carrots are usually planted. Since the appearance is more consistent with snow than soil, it indicates that the carrots are no longer rooted in soil.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the carrots retain their original appearance in terms of color and form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the carrots remain vibrant orange and maintain their typical cylindrical shape along with green leaves, which is consistent with their natural appearance. These features do not appear altered.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the image show a clear contrast between the Arctic background and the soil around the carrots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows carrots in white material resembling snow rather than soil, which creates a different visual effect. As there is no soil present around the carrots and the background is Arctic, there is no contrast between soil and the Arctic environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall setting of the image consistent with an Arctic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the setting includes snow-like material and iceberg-like formations, typical of an Arctic environment. These elements strongly indicate a climate opposite to the usual environments carrots grow in. Therefore, the setting is consistent with an Arctic environment.",
