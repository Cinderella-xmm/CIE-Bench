      "question": "Is the ballet dancer's pose represented as two distinct sticker versions in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the ballet dancer's pose is depicted through a sticker design. The placement and design contrast between the dancer and the geometric shapes suggest two different elements on the page. However, only one distinct sticker portrays the dancer, while the accompanying angular shapes provide a supporting artistic backdrop.",
