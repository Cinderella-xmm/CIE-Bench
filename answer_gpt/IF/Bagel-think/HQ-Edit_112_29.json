      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the ship and seascape rendered as a spherical 3D globe rather than a flat scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is clearly encapsulated within a spherical structure, resembling a snow globe or a miniature display globe. The ship and the seascape are enclosed in this sphere, indicating a 3D representation. This is distinct from Image A, where the scene is presented as a flat, expansive seascape under a large moon.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the miniature nautical globe enclosed within a transparent glass dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ship and ocean scene contained within a clear, spherical enclosure, which appears to be a transparent glass dome typically seen in decorative globes. In contrast, Image A does not have such an enclosure as part of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome mounted on a polished wooden base featuring intricate compass engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the globe in Image B is indeed a wooden base with noticeable engravings resembling a compass or nautical motif. This style is characteristic of decorative globes that emphasize maritime themes. Image A, by comparison, lacks a base entirely, as it shows a standalone ship on the sea.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there miniature sea creatures visible swimming below the ship inside the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are visible small sea creatures depicted under the ship, inside the globe. These are not present in Image A, where only the ocean and ship are visible without any marine life depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the waves beneath the ship depicted as small, glowing, and ethereal, consistent with moonlit illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves appear stylized and are smaller due to the miniature setting within the globe, presenting a more decorative and ethereal appearance. However, the glow is subtle and does not precisely convey moonlit illumination. In comparison, Image A displays moonlit water but lacks ethereal qualities in the wave depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the sails display visible delicate fabric textures such as weave patterns or realistic folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails appear more stylized and less detailed in terms of fabric texture due to the miniature and ornamental setting. While their shape is visible, the intricate textures such as weave patterns or realistic folds are not distinctly rendered. Image A, being a larger and more detailed illustration of a ship, might display such textures more prominently.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there swirling, translucent clouds floating inside the glass dome, distinct from the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict additional swirling clouds inside the glass dome. The visible clouds are part of the painted or illustrated background scene within the globe rather than independent, movable elements. Image A features clouds in the sky as well, but they are part of the expansive backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the interior of the dome show signs of dynamic ambiance, such as softly moving clouds or glowing wave patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interior of the globe in Image B does not suggest dynamic movement but instead presents a static scene, implying a decorative globe with fixed imagery. There are no indications of clouds moving or animated glowing waves within the dome. Image A also lacks such dynamic elements, as its scene is static.",
