      "question": "Have the white machines been transformed into vibrant, sugar-coated contraptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white machines remain unchanged in color or appearance. They retain their original industrial look without any decorative or sugar-coated modifications. The analysis process shows that while the surrounding elements have been given a whimsical candy-themed design, the machines themselves appear untouched by these edits.",

      "question": "Have the brick walls been changed to look like edible gingerbread?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brick walls remain unchanged, retaining their original gray color and texture. There is no visual cue suggesting the bricks resemble gingerbread. The process of deducing this involves noting the consistent industrial appearance and lack of any decorative alterations to mimic gingerbread aesthetics.",

      "question": "Has the concrete floor been transformed into a river of flowing chocolate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the concrete floor has been edited to appear as though it is part of a chocolate river. The floor is colored in a rich brown with a glossy look typical of chocolate, and there are streams of light blue incorporated, simulating water in a playful, candy-like way. This supports the idea of transformation into a chocolate river.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the metal ceiling trusses adorned with enormous, brightly colored lollipops and candy canes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trusses themselves are not adorned with candy; rather, large candy canes and lollipops are edited into the scene, positioned between the machines and on the floor. The absence of any decorative elements directly on the metal ceiling supports this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has multiple elements that contribute to a whimsical candy factory theme, such as the addition of brightly colored candy decorations, a chocolate river effect on the floor, and vibrant lollipops and candy cane motifs. These elements collectively create an atmosphere that aligns with a fantastical, oversized candy factory setting.",
