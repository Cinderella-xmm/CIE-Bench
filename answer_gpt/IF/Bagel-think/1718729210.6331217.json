        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow is clearly situated inside a square structure that resembles a box. This is indicated by the visible edges and the flat background that surrounds the scarecrow, suggesting it is meant to depict a diorama-like display within a box. The presence of a frame and depth suggests a contained packaging or display environment, common in artistic or commercial showcases.",
