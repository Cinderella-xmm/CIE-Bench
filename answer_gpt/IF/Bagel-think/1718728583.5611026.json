    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot feature streamlined, symmetrical forms with chrome or highly reflective metallic surfaces typical of Art Deco design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B exhibits streamlined and symmetrical geometric forms with a consistent use of angular shapes, characteristic of the Art Deco design style. The metallic sheen seen in Art Deco is represented here by straight and distinct lines rather than reflective surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos depicted as stylized geometric patterns rather than realistic birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingos are rendered using simple geometric shapes, with basic outlines and minimal details rather than realistic bird depictions. This stylization aligns with a more abstract, decorative representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees in the background have angular, geometric forms instead of natural, curved shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B have been altered to reflect angular and geometric forms, departing from the natural curved and detailed appearance of typical palm trees. This representation falls within a stylized and artistic interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rocks in the background rendered with stylized, geometric shapes rather than natural rock formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks are depicted using simple and angular geometric shapes that lack the irregular textures and details found on natural rock formations. This approach fits a more abstract and design-oriented style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene rendered in a muted pastel color palette, avoiding strong or vibrant hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B utilizes soft and muted pastel tones, which are understated compared to vibrant hues. This choice gives the image a subdued and harmonious aesthetic, typical of certain art styles that favor subtlety over vibrancy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the robot positioned centrally among the flamingos, maintaining the original compositional layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the robot is positioned prominently within the scene, surrounded by flamingos. This central positioning maintains the original compositional layout from Image A, suggesting a consistent focus on the robot amidst the flamingos.",
