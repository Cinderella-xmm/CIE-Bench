      "question": "Does the cocktail glass appear to be sculpted from clay with visible texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass appears with a smooth, matte texture and slightly irregular surfaces, which are indicative of a clay sculpture. The overall appearance is that of a handcrafted item, suggesting that it is made from clay.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ice cubes and lime slice depicted with intricate clay textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes and lime slice, like the rest of the image, do not have the usual clear and glossy look that real ice or a fresh lime slice would have. Instead, they appear matte and sculptural, consistent with a clay or ceramic medium. This aligns with the characteristics of clay, where details are typically smoothed out and texture is less intricate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the surroundings, including the bar and bottles, exhibit a handcrafted clay appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background elements in Image B, such as the bottles and the bar, are composed of rounded, overlapping forms that lack detailed features and textures, suggesting a handcrafted, clay-like quality. This appearance is consistent with materials like clay where fine detailing is minimized, and forms are more abstract.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition maintain an organic, imperfect look characteristic of hand-sculpted clay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirety of Image B possesses an organic and somewhat imperfect quality, characteristic of items that have been hand-sculpted. The smooth, non-uniform textures and slightly irregular shapes contribute to this handmade appearance, which differs from the precise forms typically seen in digital or photographic images.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting and shading adjusted to enhance the clay-like textures and three-dimensional appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shading are subtle and soft, which emphasizes the three-dimensional form of the clay-like sculptures. The shadows and highlights are used to enhance the perception of depth and the handcrafted clay texture, strengthening the overall illusion of a three-dimensional, physical object crafted from clay.",
