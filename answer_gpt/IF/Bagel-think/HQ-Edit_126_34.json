    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the cabin and surrounding landscape rendered with visible, dappled brushstrokes instead of smooth, photorealistic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin and landscape have a distinct artistic rendering style, where surfaces are characterized by visible, dappled brushstrokes. This illustrative style diverges from the realistic textures typically found in photographs. The use of broad strokes and expressive patterns suggests a painterly approach, emphasizing texture and detail in a stylized manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors in the image softened and blended, with reduced contrast and no sharp edges between color areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays softened and blended color transitions, typical of a painted or artistic depiction. Instead of stark contrasts and well-defined edges typical of photographs, the colors flow into one another. This technique reduces contrast and creates a more cohesive visual effect by employing gradient and blending techniques.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the surrounding fir trees depicted with loose, expressive brushstrokes and enhanced or non-naturalistic coloration compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fir trees exhibit a stylized representation with loose brushstrokes and coloration that appears intensified or exaggerated, deviating from natural tones. Such artistic choices give the image a vibrant quality, where colors may appear more saturated, reflecting an expressive, imaginative portrayal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smoke from the chimney rendered as a soft, blurred plume with indistinct edges, suggesting motion and warmth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the smoke from the chimney with a blurred effect, lacking sharp edges. This portrayal suggests motion and contributes to the warm, inviting atmosphere characteristic of the scene. The artistic approach to depicting smoke focuses less on realism and more on conveying mood.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ground covered in snow, and are there visible falling snowflakes, maintaining the serene winter setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to depict the ground covered in snow along with visible snowflakes falling, maintaining the serene winter setting that characterizes both images. This consistency in elements ensures the seasonal atmosphere is preserved despite stylistic changes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the cabin, chimney, surrounding trees, and snow-covered ground still clearly identifiable and present in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the artistic rendering in Image B, the cabin, chimney, surrounding trees, and snow-covered ground remain recognizable and identifiable. The stylized technique employed does not obscure these key components, ensuring that the overall structure and elements of the scene are still distinctly maintained.",
