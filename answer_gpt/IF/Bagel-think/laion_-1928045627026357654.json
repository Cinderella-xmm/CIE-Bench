      "question": "Does the male character's tee have a plush 3D appearance with a bold geometric pattern and an enlarged collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character's tee features a bold geometric pattern with diamond shapes in various pastel colors, lending it a distinct visual interest. However, despite the three-dimensional representation of the figurine, the tee does not have a plush 3D texture nor an enlarged collar. Its appearance matches the flat and smooth plastic or vinyl typical of 3D printed or molded figures.",

      "question": "Are the male character's pants rendered in a plush 3D style with a bold geometric pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the male character’s pants do not display a plush 3D style. They appear smooth and uniform, consistent with the appearance of clothing on vinyl or plastic figures. There is no bold geometric pattern present; instead, the color is a solid, muted shade typical of dress pants.",

      "question": "Do the female character's high-waisted pants feature exaggerated, prominent pleats?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female character's skirt features exaggerated and prominent pleats, standing out in a way that creates a decorative and stylistic effect typical of chibi-style figurines. These pleats appear more dramatic than those on standard clothing, contributing to the playful aesthetic of the figure.",

      "question": "Is the sleeve of the female character's top visibly enlarged compared to normal proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the female character's top maintains a relatively normal sleeve size for the style of the figure portrayed. The sleeves are not particularly enlarged, but they are represented in a smooth, animated style consistent with vinyl or plastic figurines, not deviating much from typical proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are both characters rendered as chibi-style figurines with large heads, small bodies, and cartoonish proportions, dancing on a pastel-colored stage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows both characters rendered as figurines with proportions indicative of chibi style—large heads and smaller bodies. Despite these stylized features and the pastel background, the figures are not in dancing poses, nor are they set on a stage, which means it doesn't fully align with the depiction of being on a 'pastel-colored stage'.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "question": "Do the characters exhibit graceful dance poses, joyful expressions, and are placed on a pastel-colored stage, conveying playful elegance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the figures are on a pastel-colored background and styled with chibi characteristics, they do not exhibit dance poses or expressions that convey ‘playful elegance’. The figures stand in static poses typical of vinyl figurines rather than dynamic poses, and there is no stage element clearly depicted.",
