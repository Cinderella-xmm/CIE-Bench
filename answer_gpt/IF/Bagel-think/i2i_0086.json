      "question": "Has a butterfly been added above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a discernible butterfly-shaped object visible within the mirror's reflection. The mirror presents an image from within the bathroom, but the butterfly is not placed above the mirror in the physical sense; instead, it appears within the reflection, at a level space, somewhat within the center. Given that the butterfly is evidently part of the edited image, the butterfly is not seen 'above' the mirror, but within it. Thus, recognizing the edited nature of the image, the answer focuses on the reflected space rather than physical placement.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly golden in appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly visible within the mirror's reflection in Image B exhibits a distinct golden color. The lighting and reflections augment this appearance, providing a clear contrast between the butterfly and the dark background. The golden hue stands out prominently and is well-defined, indicating that the butterfly is indeed gold-colored.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly placed above rather than beside or below the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly appears within the space of the mirror reflection, rather than being placed physically above the mirror. It is positioned centrally within this reflected area, rather than adjacent to the edges or corners of the frame. Because the mirror's reflection isn't above but rather central within the scope, the butterfly does not sit 'above' nor does it extend beyond the perimeter of the mirror. Positioning of objects within a mirror (or in reflections) is distinct as per contextual layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the butterfly blend naturally with the lighting around the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly is positioned within the mirror reflection and illuminated by the warm light from the mirror's circular light ring. This lighting accentuates the butterfly's golden color, causing it to stand out prominently against the darker background. While the lighting adds a harmonious glow, the butterfly's presence doesn't seem entirely natural within the context of a bathroom, which makes it more noticeable as an edited object rather than blending naturally.",

    {

      "question": "Does the butterfly maintain harmony with the overall environment of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B stands out due to its vibrant golden coloration against the subdued and elegant tones of the surrounding bathroom. This environment features minimalistic design elements with neutral and soft textures. While visually appealing, the butterfly is somewhat conspicuous amidst this setup, diminishing its harmony with the space which prioritizes subtlety and muted elegance.",
