        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main change from the original is the depiction of a humanoid water spirit in place of the waterfall.

The visual cues, such as the shape and color of the hair and body, resemble common representations of ethereal or mystical beings associated with water in cultural depictions.",
