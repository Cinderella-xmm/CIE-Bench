      "question": "Has the Bentley been transformed into a fragrance packaging object resembling a yacht-themed bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vehicle retains its original shape and is not transformed into another object. While some artistic embossing resembling wave patterns and text are added to the car's surface, there are no significant alterations that transform it into a fragrance bottle. Additionally, the structure and design inherent to a vehicle like wheels and seats are still visible, contradicting the transformation into a yacht-themed bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the body of the vehicle now elongated and streamlined in shape, resembling a vessel or bottle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of the vehicle in Image B remains consistent with the typical automobile design seen in Image A. There are no visual indicators of elongation or streamlining that would suggest a transformation into a bottle or vessel shape. The alterations are primarily stylistic embossments, not structural changes to the object's form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the wheels been replaced with buoyant, textured glass bases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels of the vehicle seem to have been altered in appearance to appear different from typical wheels. They are not replaced by textured glass, but rather have a uniform, smooth surface lacking traditional wheel features like tread or rims. However, the wheels don't give a visual impression of buoyant glass bases typically associated with floating elements.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a silver cap on top of the transformed object that has nautical design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image doesn't display any form of transformation into a new object with a silver cap, nor does it include elements reminiscent of nautical design, such as ropes, anchors, or masts. The vehicle remains as a convertible car without any cap or top modifications.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there embossed letters using elegant serif typography along the sides of the object that represent Bentley branding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are indeed embossed letters along the side of the vehicle. However, the text appears more artistic and decorative and does not directly replicate Bentley's branding with its specific serif typography. The embossment seems stylized, yet it doesn't specifically represent Bentley branding.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are flowing sea wave patterns visible across the surface of the transformed object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, artistic imprints resembling flowing sea waves can be seen on the side of the vehicle. These patterns give the vehicle a textured appearance, with visual elements akin to stylized waves, aligning with the query about sea wave patterns.",
