      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric of the Victorian attire is not dissolved into cosmic dust, but rather adorned with intricate golden decorations, resembling clockwork mechanisms, giving a steampunk appearance. The fabric retains its structural integrity, and there are clear, solid forms visible rather than any dispersed or ethereal cosmic dust effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass scientific instrument is depicted with clockwork tendrils and various ornate, mechanistic extensions that seem to grow organically from the device. This design choice is characteristic of a steampunk aesthetic, where machinery is elaborately detailed and often incorporates fantastical elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clockwork tendrils appear in proximity to the monkey, but they do not appear to be grasping the monkey's hands. The hands in the image are holding the scientific instrument and are not visibly distorted or entwined by tendrils.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a fanciful combination of a monkey in Victorian attire with an ornate, intricate clockwork design and a cosmic background, merging fantastical and scientific imagery. These elements indeed evoke a dreamlike and surreal atmosphere, reminiscent of Surrealism which often blends the real with the fantastical in unexpected ways.",
