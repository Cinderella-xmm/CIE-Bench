    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the armored figure visibly smaller in scale compared to its original form, consistent with being a miniature sculpture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figure is clearly enclosed in a glass dome, suggesting it is likely a miniature figure or sculpture. The glass dome and wooden base typically indicate a display setting often used for small-scale representations, reinforcing the notion of miniaturization.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the armored figure enclosed within a transparent dome featuring metallic structural elements consistent with steampunk design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the armored figure inside a transparent dome with a wooden base, featuring metallic elements like gears and spheres that fit within the steampunk aesthetic known for combining Victorian-era designs with industrial motor elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible rotating cogwheels located at the base of the structure beneath the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the dome in Image B features multiple cogwheel designs that are characteristic of steampunk motifs. These cogwheels suggest mechanical functions, aligning with the steampunk theme of intricate, visible machinery.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there small mechanical wings attached to the back of the armored figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's no evidence of small mechanical wings attached to the back of the armored figure. The figureâ€™s back is visible, and it is mostly covered by the spiked armor, with no visible attachment indicative of wings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there visible copper-colored piping details integrated into the surface of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show copper-colored piping integrated into the figure's armor. Instead, the armor maintains a metallic appearance without additional piping details, thus contradicting the statement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there multiple spherical brass filigree objects suspended in the air around the figure, mimicking planetary orbits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appears to be a singular spherical object above the armored figure and a design feature resembling planetary orbits, but the main focus remains on the singular sphere rather than a multitude around the figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the brass filigree orbs arranged in a way that creates a sense of orbiting celestial bodies, contributing to a mystical ambiance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an arrangement where a singular orb and other mechanical elements suggest a celestial influence. However, the singular orb and decorations do not fully create the intended orbiting celestial effect as the description implies. Therefore, the mystical ambiance caused by multiple orbiting celestial bodies is not achieved.",
