      "question": "Is the architectural ensemble rendered as a scaled-down 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements appear to be simplified and do not exhibit the typical characteristics of real-world structures such as weathering, fine details, or realistic depth. The vibrant colors and smoother surfaces are indicative of a miniature or model rather than life-sized architecture. This observation aligns with common representations of scaled-down models or artistic interpretations of real structures.",

      "question": "Is the 3D architectural model contained within a spherical ceramic globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the architectural ensemble openly situated and not enclosed by any form of spherical structure or globe. There are no indications of boundaries or segments that represent a surrounding globe or ceramic. The area around the architecture is fully visible and not constrained, suggesting it's not within a sphere.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the turquoise dome and ornate arches visibly enhanced with golden highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turquoise dome and arches do not show specific golden highlights. The color palette appears vibrant and similar to decorative models but lacks defined golden accents or reflections that would suggest the use of gold embellishments specifically.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there miniature palm trees visible inside the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains elements that resemble stylized, simplified palm trees within the scene, reinforcing the notion of a model or artistic depiction. However, as earlier noted, there is no surrounding globe, which means the palm trees are part of the open model setup, not contained within a globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a cobblestone path leading to the grand entrance inside the globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface leading towards the entrance of the structure lacks distinctive cobblestone detailing. It appears more uniform and does not present textural variations associated with cobblestones. Also, as previous observations, there is no evidence of a globe, and thus nothing is inside it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the exterior of the ceramic globe decorated with intricate Persian patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no depiction of a ceramic globe in Image B, which means there cannot be Persian patterns on something that isn't present. The patterns seen are on the architecture and are related to the structure itself, not an external globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the final composition present a visually cohesive blend of historical architecture and artistic design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B blends elements reminiscent of historical architecture, such as the dome and arch design, with artistic features like exaggerated colors and stylized trees. These elements collectively create a cohesive artistic interpretation while echoing the historic architectural inspirations, achieving a blend of historical and artistic design.",
