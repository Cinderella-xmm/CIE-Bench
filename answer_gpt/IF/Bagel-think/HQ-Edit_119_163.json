      "question": "Has the body of the teapot been transformed into a sleek cylindrical shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be cylindrical, contrasting the rounded body of the initial teapot in Image A. The transformation suggests a shift from the traditional teapot design to a modern cylindrical shape, most likely to represent a container or canister.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the intricate dragon engravings on the cylindrical container similar to those on the original teapot in Image A. The engravings are clear and detailed, demonstrating a continuation of the dragon motif from the original design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object has a cylindrical form with a screw cap on top, differing from the hinged teapot lid seen in Image A. This alteration indicates a design replacement from the teapot to a canister with a screw cap closure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object does not have a spout, hence it is impossible for the text 'Dragon's Delight' to be inscribed on the non-existent element. The text is actually printed on the body of the cylindrical canister.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a minimalist tea leaf logo is seen on the body of the canister near the top, but it is not positioned on the top center of the screw cap itself. The smooth surface of the cap lacks any logos.",
