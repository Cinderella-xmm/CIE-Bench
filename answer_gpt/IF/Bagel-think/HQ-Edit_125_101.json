      "question": "Is the entire scene enclosed within a transparent spherical boundary resembling a snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clear depiction of a transparent spherical boundary that encapsulates the scene inside it, resembling a snow globe. This observation is based on the distinct glass-like reflective quality and design characteristic of traditional snow globes, which typically feature a scene or figure within a contained transparent sphere.",

      "question": "Is there a 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe that replicates the leaping pose of the original dancer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a ballerina figure is visible inside the snow globe. The figure is dressed in a ballet tutu and is striking a ballet pose; however, it is not leaping like the dancer in Image A but rather standing on one leg with the other raised. The pose is more like an arabesque than a leap, indicating that it does not replicate the original dancer's pose.",

      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and at least two other recognizable miniature Parisian landmarks present inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a miniature Eiffel Tower along with other small structures inside the snow globe. There are at least two other structures that are recognizable as they resemble common architectural elements found in Paris, such as churches or similar iconic structures. The presence of multiple structures suggests that they represent Parisian landmarks.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there visible swirling snowflakes surrounding the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, within the snow globe, small white patterns resembling snowflakes are visible, distributed around the Eiffel Tower and surrounding landmarks. These patterns simulate the appearance of falling or swirling snowflakes, which is a common feature depicted in snow globes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the snow globe resting on a base made of bronze and glass, with visible engravings in French script?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe sitting on a base that appears to have a bronze-like metallic finish, a common style for decorative snow globes. The base is adorned with visible engravings, and although the text is not entirely legible, its style resembles that of French script. The combination of these features suggests a base that is both bronze in appearance and carries French text.",
