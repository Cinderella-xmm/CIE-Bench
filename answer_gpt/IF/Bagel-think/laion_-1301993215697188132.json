      "question": "Has the speaking figure been fully transformed into a wise owl character with distinct owl features such as a beak, feathers, and large eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure has been anthropomorphized into a cartoon owl, showcasing traditional owl features such as a prominent beak, large round eyes, and plumage resembling feathers. The depiction is stylized to represent an owl character, indicating a complete transformation. This helps convey the cartoon's theme effectively using recognizable traits of an owl.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue attire replaced with a feathered cloak that retains the original blue color but has a textured, feather-like surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the attire of the owl character has warm brown and orange feather patterns rather than retaining the original blue color seen in the suit of the figure in Image A. The attire is designed to mimic an owl's natural feathering, not retaining the color or appearance of the blue suit.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are small glasses visibly present and securely placed on the owl’s beak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl character in Image B is depicted with small glasses, which are positioned prominently in front of its large eyes, effectively placed where a beak meets the face. This aligns with the concept of adding personality traits to anthropomorphized animals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Art of Public Speaking\" displayed prominently at the top of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text at the top of Image B reads 'It sass DINE' rather than 'The Art of Public Speaking.' The phrase is not related to public speaking or its techniques, helping in determining the absence of the specified title.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the hand gestures been replaced with expressive wing movements that mimic the original gesture's meaning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing of the owl character mimics a human hand gesture reminiscent of Image A's open palm of the human subject. The anthropomorphic adaptation captures similar non-verbal expressive movement that an owl might use if it were gesturing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there speech bubbles present in the image containing words related to articulation and clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a speech bubble with text, but the text 'If ioeeed d af aoectr ölle.' doesn't clearly relate to articulation and clarity based on typical interpretations of the text.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the background of the image a neutral color (e.g., light gray, beige, or off-white) without patterns or distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid bright blue color rather than a neutral tone like gray or beige. The absence of patterns or distracting elements keeps the focus on the main subject.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Does the text in the infographic use high-contrast color combinations (e.g., dark text on light background or vice versa)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text such as 'It sass DINE' uses white lettering against a bright blue background, creating a high-contrast and easily readable combination. Such choices can improve visibility and readability, effective for infographic design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are subtle branch elements visible in the image, integrated into the design without dominating the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, branches are subtly integrated into the owl design near where the wings meet the body, but they don't greatly dominate the scene. They serve as part of the thematic elements consistent with an owl's habitat.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
