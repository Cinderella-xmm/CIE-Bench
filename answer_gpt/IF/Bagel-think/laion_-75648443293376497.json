      "question": "Has the backpack's fabric been replaced with a visible rugged leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack exhibits a surface that appears uneven and rough, resembling rugged leather. The texture is notably different from typical fabric textures, suggesting the use of leather. The choice of colors and sheen also contribute to the typical appearance of leather. Therefore, the combination of these visual cues implies that the fabric has been replaced with a rugged leather texture.",

      "question": "Have the buckles been updated to feature an antique brass finish instead of the original metallic silver color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buckles on the backpack have a distinct yellowish tone with an aged, tarnished appearance, characteristic of antique brass. In contrast, antique brass is different from the usual bright and shiny appearance of metallic silver. This visual modification of color and finish indicates that the buckles have been updated to reflect an antique brass finish.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The design appears to be subtle yet clearly designed in a sketch-like style, distinct from the rest of the backpack. Such a graphic is typically used for decorative purposes and suits the vintage aesthetic aimed for in the modifications.",
