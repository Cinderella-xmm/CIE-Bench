    "Question": "Q6: Does the image maintain a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio?",
    "explanation": "Based on the proportions visible in Image B, the photo appears to have more of a square format rather than a 3:2 aspect ratio. The width and height visual cues point towards equal dimensions rather than one being notably longer, indicative of a 3:2 horizontal aspect ratio.",
