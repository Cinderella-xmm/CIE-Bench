    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edited image divided into at least two distinct panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image clearly shows four separate panels, divided by clear borders, indicating a comic strip format. This is evident from the straight lines that delineate each section, a common layout for comic-style illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two men in the image transformed into cartoon-style anthropomorphic agents with visible agent-like characteristics (e.g., expressive faces, limbs, spy traits)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents figures with cartoonish features, such as exaggerated facial expressions typical of cartoons, and their attire suggests spy traits, reflecting the characteristics of cartoon-style anthropomorphic agents.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the plaid-patterned tie have a visible watch communicator device, and is there a visual expression of urgency (such as motion lines or an alarmed facial expression)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a focus on a camera pointed towards the character's face rather than a watch communicator device on the tie. The expression of urgency is hinted by the speech bubble text but not explicitly shown with motion lines or facial expressions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a circular camera lens symbol embedded within the pattern of the tie with the emblem, and is there a visual indication of activation (e.g., glow, red dot)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image focuses on a large camera held by the character, but it does not depict a symbol or lens within the tie pattern. The emphasis is on the external device rather than something embedded within the tie.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there thought bubbles present above or near the heads of the anthropomorphized agents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image contains speech bubbles but not thought bubbles. Speech bubbles typically have tails pointing to the speaker, whereas thought bubbles usually have a cloud-like appearance, which are not visible here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the image a stylized depiction of a lush green field, consistent with the original setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a stylized green field background, maintaining the lush green theme present in the original photo.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the text in the speech or thought bubbles use a crisp, minimalist, sans-serif font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in the speech bubbles of the edited image uses a font that appears hand-drawn or comic-like rather than a crisp, minimalist, sans-serif font, which would be more uniform and clean.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
