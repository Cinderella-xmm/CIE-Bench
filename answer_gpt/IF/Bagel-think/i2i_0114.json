      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is visually consistent with Leonardo da Vinci's 'The Last Supper'. The desk and the arrangement of the characters appear identical in their positions.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an individual on the far right who does not fit the style of the original painting.

      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B indicates the modern man is situated at the far right side of the painting where there appears to be a more open area compared to where the apostles are seated. He occupies a position past the group line, consistent with the far right space, thus confirming his placement.",
