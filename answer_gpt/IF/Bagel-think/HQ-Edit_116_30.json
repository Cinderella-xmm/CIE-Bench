      "question": "Is the cathedral rendered as a miniature model made of warm-stained wood instead of stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually depicts the cathedral as a smaller, intricate structure housed within a shadow box. The warm tones and wood-like appearance of the exterior suggest it is made of a material resembling warm-stained wood, rather than stone, which is typically gray or metallic in appearance. The frame of the box enhances the miniature wooden model effect.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral model situated within what appears to be a shadow box, indicated by the visible brown frame around the entire model, adding depth and allowing visual access to the model. The overall visibility and clear viewing of the model within this framing suggest that it is encased in a transparent front.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes additional details visible in the foreground of the model. These elements are recognizable as pews due to their positioning and form consistent with seating arrangements found in churches. The presence of chandeliers is inferred from structures resembling light fixtures hanging or positioned outside the cathedral model.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a series of figures positioned near what looks like clock faces or mechanisms located near the front of the cathedral model. These clocks and accompanying figures are arranged to imply that a path or motion could occur, highlighting features used in animated or kinetic sculptures.",
