    "Question": "Q2: Does the roasted chicken have two cartoonish, expressive eyes drawn or added to its face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, instead of the natural appearance of a roasted chicken, there is a yellow, cartoonish character with exaggerated large eyes that are expressive.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the plate beneath the chicken styled to resemble a throne, with decorative elements suggesting royalty or elevation?",
