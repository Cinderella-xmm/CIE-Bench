      "question": "Has the mountain been transformed into a colossal mythical creature with distinct features such as a head, wings, and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a transformation from a mountain landscape into a mythical creature. This creature is imposing and large, with visually distinct features such as what appears to be a head with glowing eyes, wing-like extensions, and a body that gives the impression of being more than just a mountain. This transformation uses the mountain's shape as the foundation and enhances it with fantasy elements, indicating it is indeed portrayed as a creature.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the mythical creature exhibit a stone-like texture throughout its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature's body in Image B has a rough, stone-like texture, which is consistent with the mountainous origin of the image. This texture indicates a natural, earthy appearance that aligns with a rocky or stone-like surface typical of mountains, making it reasonable to perceive the creature's form as having this texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the peak of the mountain clearly shaped and stylized as the head of the creature, including rock-carved eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original mountain peak has been creatively transformed to resemble the head of the creature. It features distinct glowing eyes, carved or shaped from the natural rock formation. This indicates the peak is stylized specifically as the creature's head, enhancing its mythological portrayal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the ridges of the mountain extend outward into large, wing-like structures that appear to be part of the creature’s anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays extensions that can be identified as large, wing-like structures on either side of the creature, diverging from the original mountain ridges and adding an anatomical feature to the creature. These structures give the impression of wings, suggesting the mountain has been altered to incorporate fantasy elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the roots of the mountain transformed into limb-like structures that are visibly intertwined with the silhouettes of the foreground trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no clear indications that the mountain's roots have been transformed into limb-like structures intermixed with the foreground trees. The transformation focuses primarily on the upper parts of the mountain, without incorporating features that intertwine with trees at the base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there glowing, vein-like structures running across the body of the creature that emit light in shades of blue and pink?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bright, glowing features across the creature's body, mainly around the head and chest area. These glowing elements are shades of pink, adding an ethereal element to the creature's design. However, there aren't vein-like patterns running throughout the body, limiting the glowing design to specific areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the silhouetted trees in the foreground still present and visible, with the creature’s limbs integrated among them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground of Image B retains the silhouetted trees clearly visible against the sky and creature. However, the creature’s limbs or extensions do not seem to integrate directly among the trees. The transformation is focused primarily on the mountain itself rather than interacting physically with the tree silhouettes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Is the misty layer at the base of the mountain still present, contributing to a hazy effect beneath the creature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the misty layer that can be seen at the base of the original mountain in Image A. This layer of mist continues to contribute to a haze, partially obscuring the lower part of the mountain and creature, adding an atmospheric effect to the scene.",
