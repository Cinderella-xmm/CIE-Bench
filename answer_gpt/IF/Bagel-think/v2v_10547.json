      "question": "Is there a squirrel present in the foreground of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, I can see that it doesn't have a clear depiction of a squirrel or any other animal in the foreground. The scene seems consistent with the iconic swirling sky and the cypress tree in the original 'Starry Night' by Vincent van Gogh. Given the absence of animal-like imagery and the painting's focus on the night sky and landscape, there is no indication of a squirrel being present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the squirrel blend naturally with the painting's brushstrokes and color palette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no squirrel present in Image B, a consideration of whether it blends with the painting's brushstrokes and color palette is not applicable. Thus, the analysis defaults to the absence of such an element.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the squirrel positioned in the foreground, closer to the viewer than other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observation of Image B reveals there is no squirrel. The foreground consists of the traditional elements of the painting, such as the cypress tree and the village. Therefore, the question of a squirrel being in the foreground is not applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the addition of the squirrel maintain the overall harmony and composition of the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Given that there is no squirrel added to Image B, the notion of how it might affect the harmony and composition of the painting cannot be assessed. The painting remains true to the original composition without extraneous additions.",

      "question": "Is the squirrel sized appropriately in relation to other elements in the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since there is no squirrel depicted in Image B, there is no basis to evaluate its sizing relative to other elements within the painting. Thus, there is no special consideration to be made for scene proportion or balance with a squirrel.",
