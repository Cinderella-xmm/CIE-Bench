    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the photo been converted into a minimalist flat illustration-style sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a simplified and cartoonish representation of the same scene. The visual elements are rendered with flat colors and simplified shapes, typical of a flat illustration-style sticker. This indicates the image has been transformed into a minimalist style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the boy and all bird outlines clearly present in the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of both the boy and all the birds are distinctly visible, indicating that their contours have been highlighted for clear recognition, which is a common characteristic in illustration designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have block colors been used for the boy's skin tones and the birds' feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs solid patches of color without shading, which are typical of block colors, applied to represent both the boy's skin and the birds' feathers. This method simplifies the visual detail for a cleaner look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background completely removed from the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any visible background, presenting only the characters (boy and birds) with no surrounding elements or scene from Image A, suggesting that the background has been entirely removed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the boyâ€™s head been slightly enlarged and the birds shrunk to achieve a neatly arranged composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions don't suggest a noticeable enlargement of the boy's head or a reduction of the birds' sizes. The characters fit evenly without artificial resizing typically used for composition improvement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has a thick white outline been added around the boy and birds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clear, thick white outline encircling both the boy and the birds, enhancing separation from the background, which is a design technique used to emphasize and isolate visual components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the image have a transparent background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no background elements, and the edging doesn't indicate a color border. This suggests that the background might be transparent, a typical feature of stickers or icons.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
