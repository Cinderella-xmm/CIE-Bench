      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit a 3D style with depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B provides visual cues of shadowing and texture, suggesting depth. The blanket appears to have a textured and layered appearance, adding to the effect of depth. This is achieved through the use of shadows and highlights. World knowledge of depth in images, created through techniques like shading and perspective, identifies Image B as having a 3D style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the edited image depict the kitten as actively jumping out of the screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the kitten nestled in a blanket, suggesting peacefulness rather than movement. The subject does not display dynamic motion or force lines often associated with jumping, nor does the composition imply outward movement from the frame. Through world knowledge of visual indicators for dynamic action, the kitten in Image B is not actively jumping.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the 3D effect in the image achieved without requiring special glasses or external devices?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs visual effects like shading and texture to create depth perceptions that can be seen with the naked eye. These techniques do not rely on external devices but instead use artistic methods to simulate 3D appearance. World knowledge confirms that this is a common approach to achieving depth in images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain the kitten's original appearance, including color and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B continues to show the kitten's distinct color patterns and fur texture. Despite edits for 3D effects, the basic color scheme of orange and white, and the softness of the fur remains unchanged. Knowledge of how image edits can enhance without altering base features supports the conclusion that the kitten's appearance is maintained.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's features still clearly visible and not obscured by the 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's paws and ears are visible, adjoined by the same textured effects seen on the blanket. The depth perception does not inherently obscure these features, as shading enhances rather than hides details, according to world knowledge of visual arts and depth creation.",
