      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black checkmark pathway is overlaid with a red tape-like pattern that appears intertwined and complex, suggesting a tangled and circuitous representation. This visual motif likely symbolizes complexity and difficulty.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a visible red tape pattern entangled through and around the orange circular step markers. This motif suggests bureaucratic red tape, dramatically altering the simplicity of Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the introduction of entangled red tape visuals on the pathway and around icons indicates an increased perception of bureaucratic complexity. These elements visually signify obstacles or complexity in the process for Qatar as compared to the straightforward depiction in Image A.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B introduces complexity through the red tape motif, it might distract or obscure the message of straightforward steps, reducing clarity from Image A's clear depiction. The addition of stylistic elements like tangles affects the simplicity and coherence of the infographic.",
