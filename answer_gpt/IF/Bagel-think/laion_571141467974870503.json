      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the overall scene rendered in a pop art style with bright, flat colors and comic book-like aesthetics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is characterized by the use of bright, flat colors that lack shading, combined with comic book-like aesthetics, which are indicative of the pop art style. This style often incorporates bold lines and vivid colors to create a striking visual impact. The depiction of the train, barn, and surrounding elements in this manner is consistent with pop art approaches that emphasize vibrant and non-realistic coloration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train feature bold primary colors (such as red, blue, or yellow) and halftone dot patterns on its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is depicted using bold primary colors like red and yellow, fitting the criteria of pop art design. However, upon observation, there are no halftone dot patterns on its surface, which are often used in comic art styles to create texture and shading. The absence of these patterns indicates that while the train aligns with the boldness of pop art, it does not use halftone dot patterns on its surface.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the barnâ€™s wooden texture been replaced with stylized geometric shapes instead of realistic wood grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn is rendered using bright, flat colors without any wooden texture. The visual is simplified and stylized, resembling geometric shapes with simple outlines, rather than realistic wood grain seen in traditional depictions. This is a common characteristic in pop art, where realism is replaced by abstract and geometric interpretations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the trees and grass been converted into vibrant, abstract, graphic bursts rather than realistic vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the trees and grass as vibrant, colorful shapes and graphic bursts. These do not resemble realistic vegetation; instead, they are stylized forms often found in pop art, where elements are abstracted and made visually compelling through color intensity and design simplicity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image (train, barn, tracks, foliage) outlined with sharp, black lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, major elements such as the train, barn, tracks, and foliage are indeed outlined with sharp, black lines. This technique is consistently used in pop art to define and separate areas of color, enhancing the comic book-like appearance by providing clear demarcation between different sections.",
