      "question": "Does the elephant appear as a 3D chibi-style desktop figurine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is shown as a small, stylized 3D representation encased in a clear dome with a base, typically indicative of a desktop figurine. The portrayal is simplified and cartoonish, resembling a chibi style often used in figures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elephant still depicted in its original grass-eating pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is illustrated in a similar pose to eating grass with some green leaves in its trunk and around its mouth. This indicates that despite being a figurine, it retains the original pose of eating grass.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base mimic muddy terrain with \"Jungle Friend\" engraved around the edge?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is designed to resemble a terrain with an earthen look, yet the engraving reads 'Bertvel Parek' instead of 'Jungle Friend'. This suggests the terrain mimicry but does not include the specified engraving.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the materials used matte polymer clay for the figurine and a transparent acrylic dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The appearance of the figurine in Image B suggests it is made of matte material, like polymer clay, due to its non-glossy, sculpted look. The encasing appears clear and rigid, akin to acrylic, fulfilling the material description for both components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
