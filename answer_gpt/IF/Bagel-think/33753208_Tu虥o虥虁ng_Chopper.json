    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Has the winding dirt path been transformed into a dragon-shaped form that follows the same route across the hill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the winding dirt path has been transformed into the body of a dragon, which follows the same trajectory across the hill as seen in the path from Image A. This transformation is evident due to the presence of the dragon's body integrated into the landscape where the path was originally visible.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are emerald green scales visibly covering the body of the dragon along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show the dragon with vibrant emerald green scales covering its body along the path, differing significantly from the original path in Image A that was simply a dirt route.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are fiery orange markings present along the dragon’s body, following the path’s trajectory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no fiery orange markings are visible along the dragon's body; the color scheme leans heavily towards shades of green. The original path from Image A does not have direct fiery orange markings, although it has some earthy tones.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dragon have horns that twist and resemble the shape of natural shorelines or coastal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horns on the dragon in Image B are stylized and curved but do not clearly resemble natural shorelines or coastal edges. They are more akin to typical dragon horns seen in folklore, thus not resembling nature's coastal formations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's head prominently displays two bright, gleaming jade-colored eyes, which stand out against the dragon's dark green and orange features, suggesting vividness and brilliance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are mossy, vine-like tendrils visible along the dragon’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the dragon's neck is covered with scales and does not show features resembling mossy, vine-like tendrils. The transformation does not incorporate such natural vegetation-inspired characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dragon with a fierce and aggressive facial expression, complete with sharp teeth displayed in an open mouth, which doesn't suggest calmness or serenity, but rather ferocity.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's head is indeed raised high, positioned prominently against the sky, creating a striking and dominant visual effect compared to the landscape in Image A where no dragon is present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are the surrounding trees, hills, distant mountains, and overcast sky still visible and unaltered in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as trees, hills, distant mountains, and overcast sky remain unaltered from Image A. The main focus of alteration is the dragon integrated into the path, leaving the background landscape intact.",
