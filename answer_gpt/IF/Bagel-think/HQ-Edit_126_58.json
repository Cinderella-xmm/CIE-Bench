      "question": "Is the ice swan redesigned into a complete high-end winter fragrance bottle with a clear bottle body and cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the ice swan is indeed transformed into a perfume bottle. The bottle resembles a swan, with a clear body made of glass. The bottle's cap appears to be integrated into the swan's neck design, which is a common trait in high-end and artistic perfume bottles that stylize functional elements to mimic the original shape of the object being represented.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analysis shows the swan's wings are altered to become part of the bottle's design. The wings are depicted as frosted glass enhancements that are textured and translucent, which is consistent with decorative elements on high-end perfume bottles designed to enhance aesthetic visual quality.",

      "question": "Has the swan's neck been transformed into a sleek, polished glass stopper that appears functional as a bottle cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B indicates that the swan's neck has been redesigned to function as a part of a bottle cap, suggesting practicality.

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are red, pink, and green decorative elements visibly integrated into the design of the fragrance bottle itself?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative elements surrounding the bottle include colors like red, pink, and green. However, these elements are seen outside the main body of the bottle and not integrated directly into the bottle's design itself. The presence of a pink flower beside the bottle adds visual flair, but it is external and not a part of the bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bottle with a logo on its surface, but it does not exhibit iridescence. The logo is on the bottle's main body, and while it contributes to the brand representation, it lacks a shimmering, color-changing effect which characterizes iridescence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B indicates that the label on the fragrance bottle reads “Flex Free” instead of “Winter Glow.” There is no indication of festive font styling in the observed label. The font looks sophisticated but not particularly festive.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B exhibits refined glass material, balanced proportions matching the swan theme, and sophisticated styling, which are characteristics often found in high-end fragrance bottles that mimic art or themed designs. These features contribute to its elegant overall appearance.",
