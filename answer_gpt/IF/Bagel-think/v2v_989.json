      "question": "Is the black dog depicted in a chibi-style with exaggerated, cute features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog is depicted with simple, rounded shapes and lacks detailed features, which is characteristic of a chibi style. This style often emphasizes cuteness with exaggerated features, typically larger heads and simplified bodies. The dog in Image B has been rendered in a simplistic manner, aligning with this style. The absence of realistic detail contributes to the chibi appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag rendered in a minimalist flat design without gradients or 3D effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag are depicted using a flat design style characterized by solid colors, minimal shading, and no gradients or depth effects. This style focuses on simplicity and two-dimensional representation without using 3D effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black dog the most prominent element in the illustration, with its distinct characteristics preserved?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black dog, although presented in a simplified, chibi style, is one of several elements and shares prominence with other items like the bench and juice box. Its characteristics are simplified rather than distinct or prominent, as shown in the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the illustration incorporate a bold white outline around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bold white outline surrounding the entire illustration. This outline clearly differentiates the illustration from its background and creates a sticker-like appearance, emphasizing the edges of the illustrated elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dog and bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame of the illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no circular frame. Instead, the design includes a bold white outline that encompasses each aspect of the illustration, keeping all components well within the bordered area. Therefore, the dog and bench are contained within the outline.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the background of the illustration transparent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a solid, light color (beige) surrounding the illustration and its white outline, rather than being transparent. This suggests that the background is intentionally filled with color.",
