      "question": "Has the antique clock been transformed into a sentient, mechanical creature resembling a steampunk sentinel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits significant transformations compared to an ordinary antique clock. The presence of mechanical appendages and a monocled eye suggests that the clock has been artistically altered to resemble a sentient entity, aligning with steampunk aesthetics often featuring a fusion of antiquity and machinery. This indicates the clock has been transformed into a creature with sentient qualities or at least the appearance of such qualities.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there gear-based limb-like appendages extending from the clock’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock structure includes appendages that resemble arms, which appear to be mechanical and consist of articulated joints and gears. This identifies them as limb-like appendages, commonly found in steampunk designs, integrating gears or mechanical components.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has one of the clock faces been replaced with a monocled eye?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, one of the clock faces has been altered to resemble a large eye with a monocle, utilizing the intricate detailing typical of steampunk style to create an anthropomorphic element. This change transforms the clock face to give it a visual similarity to a monocled eye.",

      "question": "Has the pendulum been transformed into a swinging tail-like structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the antique clock's pendulum still in its original position and design, without transformation indicative of a tail-like structure. The visual characteristics remain consistent with a typical pendulum and have not been altered to resemble a tail.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature’s body feature brass and copper-colored metallic surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the clock with a visually altered surface color where brass and copper tones dominate, diverging from the original neutral or wooden tones of a classic clock design (Image A). This enhancement aligns with steampunk aesthetics which frequently use warm metallic shades.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical transformation focusing on limb appendages and eye-like features does not include any visible steam valves protruding from the structure's corners or joints. This observation aligns with typical steampunk modifications but seems absent in this particular image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a clock heavily adorned with decorative patterns throughout, featuring detailed engravings reminiscent of the ornate designs seen on antique furniture or machinery. This reflects the complexity and artistry typical of steampunk-inspired adaptations.",
