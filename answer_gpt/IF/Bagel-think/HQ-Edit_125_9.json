      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layout incorporates large, bold text at the top and bottom of the image, suggesting a title and headline, respectively.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image B to Image A, the hues of red found in the jerseys and socks, as well as the green of the playing field, seem more vivid and saturated in Image B. This likely serves to draw attention and evoke the style of vibrant magazine covers.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
