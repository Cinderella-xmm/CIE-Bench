      "question": "Is the church and surrounding landscape enclosed within a dome-shaped glass case?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church and its immediate surroundings are placed inside a transparent, dome-shaped glass case. This is evidenced by the curvature of the glass and the golden finial at the top, typically associated with display cases.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The church tower in Image B has a clock face with visible Roman numerals and clock hands. However, the roof of the tower appears to have a more muted tone, which does not distinctly suggest copper coloration. The image lacks the warm orange or reddish hues typical of copper.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hills in the background are indeed depicted with clearly visible terraces and rows, which resemble vineyards.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
