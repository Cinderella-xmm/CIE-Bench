    "Question": "Q1: Is the Statue of Liberty fully enclosed within a vintage-style glass lantern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Statue of Liberty is visibly placed inside a glass enclosure that resembles a dome or cloche, characteristic of vintage-style glass lanterns. This enclosure encompasses the entire statue, lending to the appearance of being fully enclosed within the structure.

    "Question": "Q2: Does the Statue of Liberty display both verdigris (greenish-blue) and copper-hued (reddish-brown) patinas on its surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Statue of Liberty is primarily shown in a solid greenish-blue color, simulating the verdigris patina that covers the actual statue due to weathering.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the background sky rendered in soft pastel colors such as pale pink, lavender, or mint green?",

Instead, it appears to have a muted, possibly artificial color palette that is more uniform, serving as a backdrop within the glass enclosure and lacks distinct pastel hues. The background is more beige, likely due to the lighting and the indoor nature of the display.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is there a visible revolving mechanism (e.g., rotating base, gears, or central axis) at the foundation of the diorama?",

The visual presentation focuses more on the aesthetics of display rather than functionality.",
