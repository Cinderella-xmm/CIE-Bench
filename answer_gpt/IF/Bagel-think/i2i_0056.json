      "question": "Has the worker been transformed into a chibi-style 3D cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is depicted as a cartoonish, miniature figure typical of 'chibi' art style, characterized by exaggerated, cute features such as a large head relative to the body. This is evident from the disproportionate scale and simplified features intended to present a playful and endearing aesthetic. Comparing to Image A, where there is no human figure directly visible, the transformation into a chibi-style character in Image B is clear.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D character wear a yellow hard hat, a fluorescent yellow shirt, and an orange reflective vest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is clearly wearing a bright yellow hard hat, which is a common accessory for construction workers for safety purposes. Additionally, a fluorescent color scheme draws attention typically used in safety apparel, with an orange vest featuring reflective stripes, signifying a construction work environment. This attire is consistent with safety gear seen in real-world construction settings.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chibi-style 3D character placed at the center of a low-poly construction scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character centralized within a stylized, cartoonish scene that includes simplified geometric shapes associated with low-poly art styles, such as the small crane model and the surrounding environment. This setup is typically seen in animated or virtual construction scenes designed for aesthetics rather than realism. The positioning of the character in the center confirms this arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a simplified light gray plane with a small crane model included?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image analysis shows that the background is a more colorful and stylized setting, featuring simplified structures and cartoon elements, such as a small crane model, contrary to a plain gray background. The presence of multiple colors and scene elements suggests it is not a light gray plane.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a 1:1 composition ratio?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes\n```",
      "explanation": "Image B visually appears in a rectangular frame rather than a square, indicating it does not maintain a 1:1 composition ratio typically associated with square formats. Given its dimensions, it most likely adheres to a different aspect ratio, such as 4:3 or 16:9, which is common in photography.",
