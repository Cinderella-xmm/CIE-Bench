      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the central body of the drone redesigned to resemble a robotic face with sharp, angular features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone's central body visually resembles a robotic face, characterized by prominent glowing blue eyes, a mouth-like opening, and angular features that convey a more aggressive and humanoid appearance. Such changes imply a creative transformation from a mere drone to a character-like entity, incorporating elements that are consistent with futuristic and robotic design aesthetics. This conclusion is drawn from visual cues, like the sharp lines and illuminated elements, which are typical of robotic designs aimed at conveying personalities.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rotor blades replaced with arm-like structures that appear to be capable of rotation and are positioned as if in motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays arm-like structures extending from the body of the drone, replacing standard rotor blades. These arms maintain a rotor-like attachment at their ends, which implies they retain rotational functionality. The positioning suggests motion, with dynamic angles contributing to an energetic, mid-flight pose typical of action-oriented imagery. The arms visually mimic segments of robotic limbs more than traditional drone rotors, which reinforces the transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the original landing gears replaced with multiple spider-like mechanical legs extending from the drone’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The appearance of mechanical legs in Image B does not include multiple spider-like legs extending from the drone's body. Instead, the design focuses on flight elements, such as rotor arms. While the character is airborne, the emphasis is on propulsion and motion, without features resembling spider-like legs for landing or walking. Therefore, these parts of the design remain consistent and do not depict spider-like legs.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the character shown in mid-flight above a detailed futuristic cityscape with high-rise buildings and advanced urban elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the character in mid-flight, situated above a brightly lit cityscape with high-rise buildings of varied sizes, suggesting a futuristic theme. The buildings feature neon lights and modern design elements, characteristic of advanced urban settings often depicted in sci-fi and animated scenarios. This scene aligns with common futuristic city representations seen in media, where vibrant lighting and towering architecture are used to evoke advanced technological progress.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character exhibit a sleek metallic surface with reflective textures, chrome finishes, or glowing highlights indicating a metallic aura?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character depicted in Image B possesses a design that implies metallic attributes. The surface is sleek, featuring angular shapes with glowing elements, such as the brightly illuminated eyes and other parts of the body. These properties suggest reflective textures and a high-tech facade common to robotic or cybernetic entities, often portrayed with metallic finishes in visual media to signify durability and advanced technology.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a speech bubble present with the text “Secure the Quantum Core!” written in a bold, tech-style font?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B contain text, but a close examination reveals that the writing does not match the specified phrase “Secure the Quantum Core!” Instead, the existing text appears stylistically altered and abstract, making it challenging to discern the exact wording. This suggests the use of distorted typography for aesthetic effect rather than clear communication, ruling out the presence of the specified text.",
