        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents giraffes with elongated necks that are depicted in a whimsical, exaggerated manner, typical of caricature art. Caricature often involves distorting features to an extreme degree for humorous emphasis. Giraffes naturally have long necks, but here they have been stylized to appear even more stretched out than normal, consistent with caricature depiction.",

      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit new elements in the background but rather stylizes existing ones, such as modifying the texture and outlines of trees and rocks into a simpler, cartoon-like form. No new elements appear to be added to the scene, just a transformation of existing ones.",
