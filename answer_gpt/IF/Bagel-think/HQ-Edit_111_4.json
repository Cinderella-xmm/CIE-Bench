      "question": "Has the cactus been transformed into a surreal, non-naturalistic creature with a distinct sentient appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object that has replaced the cactus features elements strongly associated with surreal, fantastical design. The structure has a crystal-like spine and multiple appendages, along with glowing orbs and shapes suggesting sentience or a mystical creature. This analysis, combined with the visual cues, leads to the conclusion of a transformation into a surreal creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cactus arms now appear as segmented, flexible appendages terminating in glowing orbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms in Image B have been replaced with segmented, tentacle-like appendages terminating in glowing orbs. This is evident from their design, which differs significantly from the natural, rigid cactus structure. The addition of glowing elements further accentuates the segmentation and flexibility characteristic of non-naturalistic appendages.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the surface of the cactus fully covered with iridescent scales that display a blend of desert-colored hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface does not exhibit iridescent scales with desert hues; instead, it appears with a smooth crystal texture and vibrant colors, diverging from the notion of scales blending desert hues. The transformation involved a significant alteration in texture, without scales or colors consistent with a desert theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the central column of the cactus been replaced with a tall, faceted, crystal-like spine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual evidence in Image B, the central column of the cactus has been transformed into a spine resembling a crystal structure. The faceted appearance of this central feature strongly indicates the replacement with something that visually mimics a crystal, confirming the presence of a crystal-like spine.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there thorn-like, glowing tendrils present that follow the shape and contours of the cactus structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image in Image B shows tendril-like appendages, but they are smooth tentacle-like structures terminating in glowing orbs rather than thorn-like in nature. These elements highlight a departure from the shape and contours of the original cactus structure, resulting in the absence of thorn-like elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the surreal creature firmly anchored in sandy terrain, casting a realistic shadow, and positioned upright like a vigilant sentinel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the surreal creature standing in a manner reminiscent of an organism that has replaced the cactus, firmly positioned in sandy terrain. It casts a defined shadow onto the ground similarly to Image A, resembling the cactus's upright stance in its place and appears like a sentinel in the desert environment based on its tall, upright presence.",
