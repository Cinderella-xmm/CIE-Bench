        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the indoor study has been replaced with a medieval castle hall, we analyze Image B which features stone walls, gothic arches, and heavy wooden furniture, all typical of a medieval castle's interior. These elements contrast with the traditional study features like wooden bookshelves seen in Image A. By comparing Image A's study ambience to Image B's medieval architectural style, it's clear that Image B depicts a medieval castle hall.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses elements such as stone architecture, gothic arches, and candle lighting, which evoke a medieval ambience akin to scenes from fantasy films or literature set in castles.
