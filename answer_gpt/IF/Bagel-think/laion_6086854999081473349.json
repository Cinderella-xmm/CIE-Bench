      "question": "Are the walls of the cabin visibly transformed into bark-covered limbs with naturalistic textures and irregular shapes resembling tree trunks or branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exterior of the cabin displays textures similar to tree bark with naturalistic patterns, suggesting a transformation into tree trunks or branches.

      "question": "Have the original windows been replaced with eye-shaped features that emit a glowing amber light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, some features that appear in place of the original windows have a luminous green hue and oval shapes that could simulate eye-like structures, thus giving the impression of eyes that emit a light. However, the original windows in Image A were standard rectangular cabin windows without such illumination.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof has been visually edited to resemble a canopy of green foliage, simulating leaves and branches that create an upward extension beyond the original roofline. This transformation gives the roof an impression of being part of the forest, significantly differing from the simple wooden roof seen in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entirety of the cabin including the roof, walls, and corners appears covered with visual representations of vines or moss, contributing to its organic and earthy transformation. These elements are absent in the original Image A where the cabin’s structure is plain and of rustic log wood.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows modifications with visual symbols resembling mystical runes scattered across the surface of the cabin. These designs contribute to a magical or enchanted theme that is absent from the plain, unadorned wooden logs visible in Image A.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garage doors are not replaced with any visible facial features or elements displaying personality and glowing energy trails. The modifications maintain a stylistic pattern amid the atmospheric edits, but do not resemble animated forest spirit faces differing greatly from Image A’s standard garage doors.",
