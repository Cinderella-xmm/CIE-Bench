        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus and sombrero are visible, but they appear to be within the packaging and are less detailed compared to an unboxed view. The edited image focuses more on the presentation of the items within their packaging rather than the intricate details of each crochet stitch visible in Image A. Therefore, detailed crochet stitches are not visibly present.",
