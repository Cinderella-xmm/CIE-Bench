    "Question": "Q1: Has a person been added to the image near the zebra's tail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a person's figure is visible to the right behind the zebra, suggesting they are walking toward the zebra. Given the positioning in Image B, the person is near the zebra, more to the side than directly by the zebra's tail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the zebra have its head partially turned toward the person?",
    "explanation": "From visual observation in Image B, the zebra maintains a downward stance, seemingly drinking or grazing, and does not seem to have its head turned toward the person who is positioned behind and to the right. Thus, the zebra's attention does not appear directed at the person.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the person's foot positioned near or on the zebra's tail?",
    "explanation": "The image depicts the person walking behind the zebra but not directly on or near its tail. The setup and perspective show no overlap between the person's feet and the zebra's tail.",

}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the original elements of the watering hole and surrounding environment maintained?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the zebra's expression and posture indicate it is startled?",
