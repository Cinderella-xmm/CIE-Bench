    "Question": "Q1: Is the character depicted as a 3D half-body figure?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the character is depicted in full-body rather than a half-body view. The character is standing upright and the entire figure from head to toe can be seen within the frame. Thus, the depiction is of a full-body figure. This conclusion is based on recognizing the positioning and framing in the image. This contrasts with a typical half-body figure depiction that usually shows only the upper part of the body.",
